| Introduction: FPF as a Pattern Language and its Historical Roots | full text | Introduces FPF's core mission to solve knowledge silos using a generative pattern language, outlining its intellectual lineage from Aristotle to Constructor Theory. |
| Intellectual lineage | full text | Traces FPF's key ideas to their roots in various disciplines, from pattern languages and constructor theory to formal methods and trust calculus. |
| Assurance and Imagination: FPF’s Two Engines | full text | Explains how FPF integrates both assurance (audits, evidence) and creativity (generating novel ideas), treating them as two complementary engines for responsible innovation. |
| Navigating Uncertainty: Building Closed Worlds within an Open World | full text | Explains how FPF reconciles Open-World and Closed-World assumptions, using Bounded Contexts to create reliable 'islands of closure' for engineering decisions. |
| FPF as an Evolutionary Architecture for Thought | full text | Positions FPF as an architecture for the reasoning process itself, designed to sustain key characteristics like auditability, evolvability, and falsifiability. |
| Beyond Cognitive Biases: FPF as a Generative Architecture for Thought | full text | Contrasts FPF's generative, structural approach to avoiding cognitive errors with the traditional corrective, diagnostic approach of hunting for biases. |
| Descriptive Ontologies vs A Thinking-Oriented Architecture | full text | Differentiates FPF's goal of orchestrating reasoning from classical ontologies' goal of cataloging existence, emphasizing FPF's focus on objectives, trust, and dynamics. |
| FPF and 1980s Expert Systems: Shared Ambition, Different Contract | full text | Contrasts FPF as an 'architecture for thinking' with classic 'inference engines', highlighting differences in goals, world assumptions, and evolvability. |
| The “big storylines” unique to FPF (load‑bearing commitments) | full text | Lists the eight core, load-bearing commitments that define FPF's unique architectural and philosophical stance. |
| Transdisciplinarity as Meta-Theory of Thinking | full text | Explains how FPF treats transdisciplinarity as a meta-theory for designing reasoning, using architheories as generative scaffolds grounded in physical reality. |
| Artefact Families as a Publication Contract | full text | Defines the three-family architecture (Core, Tooling, Pedagogy) governed by a unidirectional dependency rule to maintain conceptual integrity. |
| Intellect Stack (informative overview) | full text | Presents a five-layer pedagogical map of cognitive skills (Structure → Knowledge → Action → Strategy → Purpose) and links them to FPF patterns. |
| Purpose, Scope, and Explicit Non-Goals | full text | Clarifies FPF's mission as a generative scaffold for thought, its scope as tool-agnostic normative patterns, and what it explicitly is not (e.g., a domain encyclopedia). |
| How to Navigate Architectural [A] and Definitional [D] Patterns | full text | Provides heuristics for reading the specification by distinguishing deep-dive [A] patterns from precise [D] definitions and using the ToC and links to navigate. |

# **Preface** (non-normative)

## Introduction: FPF as a Pattern Language and its Historical Roots 

Modern science and engineering face a chronic ailment: **knowledge silos**. Specialised vocabularies accelerate depth yet obstruct cross-disciplinary reasoning. Previous cures oscillated between rigid “one-schema-fits-all” systems and airy meta-frameworks with little pragmatic bite. **First Principles Framework (FPF)** proposes a third path: a **pattern language** that is _generative_ rather than prescriptive—a toolkit for constructing thought. 

+Each pattern follows the **Alexanderian quartet** (context ▲ problem ▲ solution, plus consequences); **\[A]** patterns use a seven‑part template and **\[D]** patterns are light‑weight micro‑stubs. **Both end with a _Conformance Checklist_ (CC)**—a logical test stated without tooling jargon. Patterns interlock to form an **operating system for thought** that is designed to **evolve** (Open‑Ended Evolution, **A.4**).

FPF is designed to serve three primary roles: the Engineer, who builds reliable systems; the Researcher, who grows trustworthy knowledge; and the Learner, who develops robust mental models. 

**This draft also makes explicit the constitutional and publication architecture that governs the language**: **E.1–E.4** (Vision, **Eleven Pillars**, Principle Taxonomy, Artefact Architecture) and the **Guard‑Rails E.5.\*** (Lexical Firewall, Notational Independence, Unidirectional Dependency, Cross‑Disciplinary Bias‑Audit), with evolution driven by **Design Rationale Records (E.9)**. It adopts an **Open‑Ended Kernel with Architheory Layering (A.5–A.6)** and introduces the **Unification Suite (Part F)**—Contextual Lexicon, **SenseCells/Bridges with CL**, **Concept‑Sets**, and the **Unified Term Sheet (UTS)**—as the publication surface for cross‑domain alignment. Alongside assurance and compliance, the Core includes **Creativity‑CHR (C.17)**, **NQD‑CAL (C.18)**, and **E/E‑LOG (C.19)**, bound to the **Abductive Loop** via **B.5.2.1**, turning ideation into **instrumented, Pareto‑front exploration**.

## Intellectual lineage *(non‑normative)*

FPF stands on a deliberately cross‑disciplinary scaffold. What follows traces the ideas that most visibly shaped its kernel, algebra, and publication contract.

* **Epistemic discipline & falsifiability (first principles).**
  FPF’s mission and invariants center on falsifiable, auditable change: evolvability, cross‑scale coherence, and didactic transparency. These are operationalised as a micro‑kernel plus pluggable architheories and a pattern language—so that claims can be tested, versioned, and traced end‑to‑end.

* **Pattern language as the operating system for thought.**
  The specification uses an Alexander‑style pattern form (context → problem → solution → consequences) with a conformance checklist at the end of each pattern; architectural \[A] patterns and definitional \[D] micro‑stubs interlock to form a generative language.

* **Bounded contexts, sense alignment, and controlled crossing.**
  Meaning is local to `U.BoundedContext`; cross‑context reuse is explicit via **Bridges** that carry a **Congruence Level (CL)** and loss notes, and via the **two‑bridge rule** (scope bridge + kind bridge) that penalizes assurance **R** while keeping **F** and **G** invariant. The **Unified Term Sheet** (UTS) operationalises this discipline with SenseCells and CL/Loss entries.

* **Formal methods & type‑theoretic rigor (post‑2015 toolchain awareness).**
  The kernel’s **Formality scale (F0…F9)** ties claims to increasing rigor—from checkable predicates to machine‑checked proofs and higher equality/univalence. The spec explicitly interfaces with modern proof assistants and foundations (Lean 4, Coq, Isabelle; “Propositions as Types”), grounding F7–F9 content without mandating a single tool.

* **Holonic mereology and identity through change.**
  FPF’s world is holonic: part–whole structure (A.14), explicit temporal stance (Tᴰ/Tᴿ), and an **ecumenical identity** contract that admits both 4D and 3D+1 readings when boundaries and events are declared. The **Meta‑Holon Transition (MHT)** captures genuine emergence—new boundary, objective, or supervision—rather than “massaging arithmetic” inside the same level.

* **External transformer & causal clarity (constructor‑style stance).**
  Every change is enacted by a **system bearing `TransformerRole`** across a boundary; “self‑magic” is forbidden and handled by a **Reflexive Split** when needed. This externalisation of agency aligns with post‑2015 “constructor‑style” thinking about tasks and capability as the unit of causal explanation.

* **Role–Method–Work alignment & enactment gating.**
  To prevent category errors, FPF strictly separates **roles** (contextual masks), **Method/MethodDescription** (capability/recipe), and **Work** (dated execution). The **Green‑Gate Law** gates any step that “requires role R” by a contemporaneous **StateAssertion** in an RSG (role state graph).

* **Measurement, comparability, and gauge discipline (post‑2015 metrology).**
  The **MM‑CHR** architheory and **A.19** provide a notation‑free operator library (Sub/Emb/Prod/Quot/**Fix\_g**), monotone gauges, quotient/gauge‑fixing, Lipschitz‑bounded predicates, and explicit **Φ(CL)**/**Ψ(CL^k)** penalties when meaning crosses spaces/Contexts—reflecting contemporary measurement theory and robust evaluation practice.

* **Knowledge graphs & semantic web standards (post‑2015 maturation).**
  The spec’s unification and provenance model draws on RDF 1.2/OWL 2, Common Logic, and PROV‑O, treating evidence and lineage as first‑class while remaining tool‑agnostic.

* **Systems & software engineering standards (architecture, lifecycle, quality).**
  FPF’s status separation (standard/evidence/requirement), architecture description discipline, and lifecycle obligations track contemporary standards—e.g., ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 (architecture), 15288:2023 (life cycle), and ISO 25010—again used as conceptual anchors rather than prescriptive tooling.

* **Open‑world *and* closed‑world reasoning (explicit stance).**
  The preface situates FPF as a hybrid: it operates in the open world while constructing locally closed worlds (Contexts) for reliable engineering decisions; OWA/CWA are reconciled through explicit scope, time selectors (Γ\_time), and typed guards.

* **Trust & assurance calculus (F–G–R with congruence).**
  Assurance is explicit and conservative: Cross‑context reuse never silently upgrades claims; instead, declared bridges and their CL drive **R‑lane** discounts, with “incomparable” as a legitimate outcome when gauges are missing.

* **Agency spectrum & active inference (2017→).**
  FPF treats agency as a graded, context‑bound role rather than a base type. The `Agency‑CHR` and `AgentialRole` pattern synthesize insights from active inference and basal cognition into a practical, auditable model for autonomy, responsibility, and risk.

* **Regulatory semantics & deontics (typed guards; no synonym shortcuts).**
  Regulatory categories are **Kinds** with declared intent and F; adoption across Contexts uses guard macros, **KindBridges** with type‑congruence **CL^k**, and deterministic membership, keeping scope and kind mapping separate and penalising **R** accordingly. Acceptance clauses are modeled as predicates over observed Work with explicit windows.

* **Governance, language, and publication contract.**
  An **Open‑Ended Kernel with Architheory Layering** is governed by guard‑rails—lexical firewall, notational independence, unidirectional dependency—and published through the **Unification Suite** (SenseCells/Bridges/Concept‑Sets/UTS). Design Rationale Records (DRRs) drive controlled evolution.

* **Didactic primacy and manager‑level exemplars.**
  From pump curves to SRE incidents, the spec embeds manager‑oriented vignettes that show how the algebra reads in practice—evidence freshness, role gating, typed guards—so the lineage remains testable where decisions are made.

> **Synthesis.** Across these lines, the through‑line is **explicitness**: explicit context, explicit roles, explicit bridges and losses, explicit gauges, explicit proofs. The result is a substrate‑neutral framework where ideas graduate into reliable action without sacrificing scientific humility.

## Assurance *and* Imagination: FPF’s Two Engines *(non‑normative)*

Most frameworks pick a side. They either optimise for **assurance**—audits, evidence, safety gates—or they celebrate **creativity**—ideas, leaps, pivots. **First Principles Framework (FPF)** is built to do both at once. It gives you sturdy rails for trust **and** a disciplined way to generate and mature novel ideas.

**On the assurance rail,** FPF makes trust a first‑class concern. Claims are anchored to evidence; formality can scale from plain checks to machine‑verified proofs; confidence is computed, not intuited. Meaning is kept local to an explicit frame of reference so “the same word” can’t quietly shift under your feet. The result is a reasoning trail that explains *why* a decision is justified—clear enough to audit, conservative enough for safety, and evolvable over time.

**On the imagination rail,** FPF is equally deliberate. It does not treat creativity as a black box or a personality trait. It provides a **named choreography for creative work**:

* **Abduct first.** Start with the *“what could be true?”* move—the **Abductive Loop**—to propose bold candidate explanations or designs before you overfit to today’s data.
* **Search widely, then focus.** Use an **open‑ended search** style to illuminate “adjacent possibles,” then apply an **explore–exploit governor** to decide when to roam for surprises and when to double‑down on promising directions.
* **Shape → Evidence → Operate.** Turn a promising sketch into a concrete shape, collect the right evidence to test it, and run it for real. Then loop.

FPF also **measures creative quality**. It distinguishes novelty for its own sake from *valuable* novelty. Work is scored along simple, universal characteristics—*Is it new?* *Is it useful?* *Does it fit the constraints?*—so that teams can compare options without collapsing into taste or hierarchy.

| Question we must answer         | FPF’s assurance move                                                      | FPF’s creative move                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *“Why should we trust this?”*   | Tie every claim to explicit evidence; make confidence and scope visible.  | Keep space for hypotheses that stretch the current model, but insist they graduate into evidence.     |
| *“How do we grow safely?”*      | Evolve in small, auditable steps; record rationale for changes.           | Run **open‑ended** searches early, then **govern** the switch from exploring to refining.             |
| *“What does ‘good’ look like?”* | Pass/fail against declared acceptance criteria; compute assurance levels. | Score creative candidates on **Novelty, Use‑Value, Surprise, Constraint‑Fit**—not just style points.  |

*In a lab:* a puzzling anomaly isn’t “noise”; it is a **prompt**. You generate alternate explanations, explore them widely, then pick a direction with a clear **explore–exploit** rule. Each candidate must face a **fit‑for‑purpose** test; only those with evidence advance.
*In a product team:* concept sketches are not meetings in disguise; they are first‑class artifacts that move through **Explore → Shape → Evidence → Operate**. Creativity is expected; untested cleverness is not.
*In operations:* procedures are safe by design, yet the framework leaves Context for **abductive fixes** when reality throws a curve ball—*provided* they are later folded back into the evidence trail.

Assurance without imagination calcifies. Imagination without assurance drifts. FPF’s contract is to **separate the moves cleanly**—so you can be genuinely inventive without losing your audit trail—and to **reconnect them on purpose**—so good ideas survive contact with the world. The framework’s creative patterns make *generation* systematic; its assurance patterns make *selection* and *adoption* reliable. That is how a team becomes both safe and original.

> **Synthesis.** FPF treats creativity as a governed search and assurance as a repeatable reckoning. Together they form an **engine for changing your mind responsibly**—and then changing your world.

## Navigating Uncertainty: Building Closed Worlds within an Open World *(non-normative)*

A fundamental challenge in any rigorous thinking is how to handle incomplete information. To build reliable systems and make trustworthy claims, we must make decisive judgments based on what we know, while remaining aware of the vast ocean of what we don't. This tension is formally captured by two opposing assumptions about the world: the Open-World Assumption and the Closed-World Assumption. FPF does not force a choice between them; instead, it provides a principled architecture for using both where they are most appropriate.

The distinction is best understood through a simple analogy:

*   **The Open-World Assumption (OWA): Absence of proof is not proof of absence.**
    If a name is not on a party guest list, we cannot conclude they are not coming. The list might simply be incomplete. This is the assumption of science, exploration, and the internet. It is a world of unbounded possibility, where new facts can always be discovered.

*   **The Closed-World Assumption (CWA): What is not known to be true is considered false.**
    If a name is not on a flight manifest, the airline and the security services will conclude they are not on the plane. For safety and operations, the list is assumed to be complete and authoritative. This is the assumption of databases, legal contracts, and safety-critical engineering. It is a world of bounded certainty, where we need to make reliable decisions based on a defined set of facts.

FPF is a hybrid system, architected to operate within the reality of an open world while enabling the construction of the reliable, locally-closed worlds necessary for engineering.

**How FPF Embraces the Open World?**
The framework is fundamentally designed to acknowledge that our knowledge is never complete. This OWA stance is embedded in its core principles:

*   **Open-Ended Evolution (P-10):** FPF is built on the premise that any holon—a system, a theory, a method—is perpetually incomplete and can be improved. New evidence can always emerge.
*   **Open-Ended Kernel (A.5):** The architecture of a minimal kernel with plug-in architheories is an admission that the core cannot and should not attempt to describe everything. The world is too rich for any single, final ontology.
*   **The Abductive Loop (B.5.2):** The very first step of the reasoning cycle is to generate a new hypothesis. This act is a formal recognition that our current model is insufficient to explain an anomaly—a clear OWA posture.  It operationalised by **B.5.2.1** via **C.17–C.19**.

**How FPF Constructs and Manages Closed Worlds?**
While the universe is open, engineering requires us to build systems that are safe, predictable, and auditable. To do this, we must be able to draw a line and declare that, *for a specific purpose*, our knowledge *within that line* is complete. FPF provides the formal tools to build and govern these "islands of CWA":

*   **`U.BoundedContext` (A.1.1):** This is the primary mechanism for establishing a local CWA. Within a Bounded Context, a specific set of models, rules, and invariants is declared to be authoritative. Any statement that violates an invariant *within that context* is considered false.
*   **`U.Boundary` (A.1):** The boundary of a holon is the physical or conceptual wall of the CWA island. It makes the distinction between the managed "inside" and the unmanaged "outside" explicit, turning an abstract assumption into a concrete architectural feature.
*   **Conformance Checklists:** Each pattern's checklist acts as a set of CWA rules. A model that fails a check is not "of unknown status"; it is formally **non-conformant**.
*   **Assurance Levels (B.3.3):** The assurance calculus makes a decisive CWA judgment on trust. A claim without an explicit evidence anchor is not "of unknown reliability"; it is assigned **`AssuranceLevel: L0 (Unsubstantiated)`**. For the purpose of making decisions, it is not trusted.

In essence, FPF does not attempt the impossible task of transforming the open world into a closed one. It provides the architectural discipline to draw a firm line in the sand, make a reliable decision based on what's inside that line, and always remain aware of the open, unbounded world that lies beyond it.

## FPF as an Evolutionary Architecture for Thought 

A method of thinking is itself a system. Like any system, it can be designed with ad-hoc, brittle connections that fail under pressure, or it can be architected for resilience, clarity, and growth. The First Principles Framework is not merely a collection of concepts or a static ontology; it is a formal **architecture for a method of trans-disciplinary thinking**. Its very structure—a collection of interconnected Architectural and Definitional Patterns presented as a series of design records—is a deliberate choice that mirrors its function.

This concept is directly analogous to the modern practice of **Evolutionary Architecture** in software engineering. An evolutionary architecture is one designed to support incremental, guided change across multiple dimensions. It acknowledges that the systems we build are never "finished" and must be able to adapt to new requirements and a changing environment without catastrophic rewrites. The architecture itself provides the stable pathways and guiding principles—the "fitness functions"—that allow the system to evolve gracefully.

FPF applies this same architectural thinking to the dynamic of reasoning itself. It provides a set of load-bearing patterns and constitutional principles (The Eleven Pillars) that act as the fitness functions for our thoughts. By building our reasoning within this architecture, we are not just seeking a correct answer in the moment; we are creating an intellectual artifact that is designed to last, to be understood, to be challenged, and to evolve.

The value of this architectural approach lies in its ability to explicitly protect and sustain the critical **characteristics of rigorous thought**, holding them from the natural degradation they suffer in complex, long-running projects. Where traditional critical thinking identifies failures in these characteristics, FPF provides the mechanisms to build them in by design. **Creative generativity** is explicitly instrumented: the **Creativity‑CHR → NQD‑CAL → E/E‑LOG** stack supplies measurable **Novelty/Quality/Diversity** signals and explore–exploit policies.


| Architectural Characteristic of Thought | What it protects / why it matters | The FPF Mechanisms that Preserve It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Auditability & Traceability** | The unbreakable chain from a claim back to its evidence. This is the quality of being able to answer "Why is this true?" at any point. | **`Evidence Anchoring (A.10)`**, the **`Design-Rationale Record (DRR) Method (E.9)`**, and the entire **`Trust & Assurance Calculus (B.3)`**. The architecture makes untraceable claims a modeling violation. |
| **Evolvability** | The capacity of a model or system to adapt to new information or requirements without losing its conceptual integrity. | The **`Open-Ended Evolution Principle (P-10)`**, the **`Canonical Evolution Loop (B.4)`**, and the **`DRR Process (E.9)`**. Change is not a bug; it is a formally managed, first-class feature of the architecture. |
| **Creativity (Generative Novelty & Value)** | The ability to reliably generate, select, and mature novel hypotheses/designs that are both *new* and *fit to purpose*—exploration without losing auditability or safety. | **`Creativity‑CHR (C.17)`** for measurable **Novelty / Use‑Value / Surprise / Constraint‑Fit**; **`NQD‑CAL (C.18)`** for open‑ended, illumination‑style search; **`E/E‑LOG (C.19)`** to govern explore↔exploit policies; **`Creative Abduction with NQD (B.5.2.1)`** / **`Abductive Loop (B.5.2)`** to structure hypothesis generation; **`Design‑Rationale Record (E.9)`** to capture decisions so creativity stays auditable. |
| **Composability & Modularity** | The ability to construct complex, reliable ideas from simpler, independently verifiable components. | The **`Open-Ended Kernel (A.5)`**, **`Architheory Signatures (A.6)`**, **`Universal Γ (B.1)`**, plus **Boundary‑Inheritance Contract (BIC)** and the **Cut‑Stable Boundary Axiom** for safe structural cuts, and the **Method Interface Contract (MIC)** for typed method I/O and conservation constraints. Together they make composition predictable and auditable.  |
| **Falsifiability** | The quality that every claim is structured so it can be rigorously tested and potentially proven false. | **`Conformance Checklists`** embedded in every pattern and the **`Trust & Assurance Calculus (B.3)`**. Every normative artifact must declare success/failure criteria and null tests. |
| **Cross-Scale Coherence** | The guarantee that the same fundamental logic applies to a single component, an integrated system, and a system‑of‑systems. | **`Cross-Scale Consistency (A.9)`**, **Universal Γ (B.1)** with proof obligations for context/time reasoning (Proof Kit), and declared Γ‑fold policies over WLNK/COMM/LOC/MONO + time policy (no free‑hand averages). These preserve invariants across zoom levels and eras.  |
| **Design–Run Separation (Temporal Integrity)** | Prevents “design/run chimeras”, keeps assumptions/versioned specs separate from runtime evidence; enables reproducible state over time. | **A.4 design–run split** (used across CHR/creativity), **KD‑CAL CC‑KD‑08** (no episteme mutation in Work), **Γ_time** rules (T‑1..T‑3), **DRR (E.9)** for rationale/versioning, **Canonical Evolution Loop (B.4)** for orderly change.  |
| **Lexical & Representation Discipline** | Guards against category errors and notation lock‑in; keeps language unambiguous and tool‑neutral across contexts. | **Strict Distinction** (didactic distillation of SD), **LEX‑BUNDLE (E.10)**, and **Guard‑Rails E.5.\*** (DevOps Lexical Firewall, Notational Independence, Unidirectional Dependency, Bias‑Audit). All meanings live in a **`U.BoundedContext`** and cross only via Bridges. |
| **Measurement Typing & Units** | Ensures metrics are correctly typed (ordinal/interval/ratio), unitful, and safe to operate on; forbids “ordinal averages”. | **A.17/A.18** measurement discipline + **MM‑CHR (C.16)** templates; **KD‑CAL CC‑KD‑12** (units/envelopes/windows). |
| **Order/Time‑Safe Orchestration** | Separates structure from control‑flow and time; prevents hidden order/time bugs in authored models. | **Γ_ctx** (NC‑1..3) and **Γ_time** (T‑1..T‑3) laws; **CT2R‑LOG** “no order/time in parts”; **E.14** “no order/time in structure” for authoring conformance. |
| **Trust Calibration & Cross‑Context Integrity** | Keeps claims honest when moved across Contexts; reduces over‑optimism via weakest‑link and CL penalties. | **Trust & Assurance Calculus (B.3)** (F‑G‑R characteristics), **Bridges with CL** (KD‑CAL **CC‑KD‑07**), and creativity rules that lower **R** (not scale) when crossing contexts.  |
| **Agency & Accountability (SoD)** | Makes “who acts” explicit; enforces Separation‑of‑Duties so evidence isn’t self‑authored. | **A.2 Role suite** & **A.15 run‑alignment** (roles vs evidence/work), SoD gates in creativity flows (“fails SoD — same author as reviewer”). |
| **Scope Safety & Encapsulation** | Prevents scope‑creep and category bleed; each claim applies only within its declared Context/context and exits only via governed bridges. | **Γ_ctx (NC‑1..3)** and **`U.BoundedContext`** for hard context walls; **Bridges with CL** (KD‑CAL **CC‑KD‑07**) for governed crossings; **CG‑frame (A.19)** to declare scope of comparability. |
| **Reproducibility & Deterministic Replay** | Ability to re‑obtain the same result given the same inputs, model version, and time policy; enables trustworthy debugging and audit. | **A.4 Design–Run split**, **Γ_time (T‑1..T‑3)**, **CT2R‑LOG** (“no order/time in parts”), **E.14** (“no order/time in structure”), **DRR (E.9)** for versioned rationale, **Evidence Anchoring (A.10)**. |
| **Change‑Impact Predictability (Blast‑Radius Control)** | Changes have bounded, knowable effects; reviewers can see which CG‑frames, bridges, and claims are touched. | **Canonical Evolution Loop (B.4)** with explicit deltas, **DRR (E.9)** change graph and decision record, **Evidence Anchoring (A.10)** for provenance links, **Trust & Assurance Calculus (B.3)** to update risk post‑change, **CG‑frame (A.19)** to localize roll‑ups. |
| **Exploration Health (Portfolio Coverage)** | Avoids local maxima and groupthink; measures how widely we explore. | **Creativity‑CHR (C.17)** **`Diversity_P`** + coverage maps (illumination), **NQD‑CAL (C.18)** **`IlluminationSummary`**, **E/E‑LOG (C.19)** **`explore_share`/policy. |
| **Constraint Safety & Ethical Assurance** | Ensures non‑negotiable constraints (safety/ethics/standards) gate enactment; prevents “novelty theft”. | **`ConstraintFit` (C.17 §5.4)** as eligibility, **D‑cluster Bias‑Audit & Ethical Assurance (D.5)**; attribution tracked via **`AttributionIntegrity`**. |
| **Didactic Clarity & Working‑Model Primacy** | Keeps the human‑readable canon primary; assurance flows downward; readers can reason without tool lock‑in. | **E.12 Didactic Primacy & Cognitive Ergonomics**, **E.14 Human‑Centric Working‑Model** (conformance checklist), **E.7** Tell‑Show‑Show.  |
| **Typed Reasoning (Kinds & Intent/Extent)** | Prevents category confusions; enables typed, context‑local reasoning and safe Cross‑context mappings. | **Kind‑CAL (C.3)** — `U.Kind` & `SubkindOf`, **KindSignature & Extension**, **KindBridge & CL^k** for Cross‑context mapping.  |
| **Comparability & Roll‑up Integrity (CG‑frames)** | Makes “same number” meaningful across teams; preserves invariants in aggregation. | **CG‑frame (A.19)** comparability modes and explicit Γ‑fold declarations (WLNK/COMM/LOC/MONO + time policy); integrates with **Bridges with CL** for Cross‑context moves; benefits include safe roll‑ups and RSG‑ready gates. |

Therefore, FPF should be understood not as a passive library of terms, but as an **engineered method for thinking**. Its patterns are the architectural decisions that shape this method. Its ultimate value is not in any single model it can produce, but in the enduring quality of the reasoning process it sustains—a discipline that is auditable, evolvable, and coherent by design.

## Beyond Cognitive Biases: FPF as a Generative Architecture for Thought 

The modern discipline of critical thinking has rightly focused on identifying and mitigating a long list of cognitive biases—the predictable glitches in our intuitive reasoning, from confirmation bias to the availability heuristic. The practice of "bias hunting" is a valuable diagnostic tool for improving our intellectual hygiene. However, it suffers from a fundamental limitation: it is primarily **corrective, not constructive**. It teaches us how to find flaws in existing arguments but offers little guidance on how to build a robust, complex argument from first principles.

This reactive approach is like trying to improve road safety by handing drivers a list of 50 common mistakes. While helpful, it is an incomplete solution. It relies on the driver's constant vigilance to avoid an ever-growing catalog of potential errors—a cognitive "whack-a-mole" that is both exhausting and ultimately fallible.

The First Principles Framework (FPF) proposes a different, complementary approach. It is not concerned with correcting the driver's psychology, but with **designing a safer car and establishing the rules of the road**. FPF is a **generative architecture for thought**. Its primary purpose is not to diagnose errors, but to provide a structural scaffold that makes entire classes of errors difficult or impossible to commit in the first place.

This architectural approach shifts the focus from the internal, fallible state of the thinker to the external, verifiable structure of their thoughts. Where the study of cognitive biases offers a map of mental pitfalls, FPF provides the engineering blueprints for building a bridge over them. The following table illustrates how FPF's architectural solutions provide structural protection against common cognitive failure modes—many of which are deeper and more systemic than those on the classic lists of biases.

| Cognitive Failure Mode | The Conventional Approach (Diagnostic) | The FPF Solution (Architectural & Generative) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conflation of Plan and Reality** | Reminds us to be aware of the **Planning Fallacy** or **Confirmation Bias**, where we seek evidence that our plan is working and ignore contradictory data. | **`Temporal Duality (A.4)`** and the strict distinction between `design-time` artifacts (`MethodDescription`, `WorkPlan`) and `run-time` artifacts (`Work`). This is not a psychological reminder; it is a **category error** to mix them. The architecture enforces the separation. |
| **Ambiguity and Equivocation** | Warns against using vague terms or shifting the meaning of a word mid-argument. | **`Lexical Discipline (E.10)`** and **`U.BoundedContext (A.1.1)`**. FPF bans overloaded terms like "process" from its core and requires that all domain terms be explicitly projected onto precise FPF concepts within a bounded context. Ambiguity is architecturally constrained, not just advised against. |
| **Causality Collapse & Lack of Accountability** | Points out the **Fundamental Attribution Error** or describes situations where causes are poorly understood. | **`External Transformer Principle (A.12)`**. FPF makes it an architectural invariant that every change **must** be attributed to an external agent (`System` in a `U.RoleAssignment`). "It configured itself" is not a cognitive bias; it is a **modeling violation**. Causality is non-negotiable. |
| **Inconsistent Aggregation & Scope Neglect** | Highlights biases where we incorrectly generalize from parts to a whole or ignore the scale of a problem. | **`Cross-Scale Consistency (A.9)`** and the **`Universal Algebra of Aggregation (Γ)`** with its **Invariant Quintet (B.1)**. FPF provides a formal, conservative algebra (e.g., the Weakest-Link bound) for aggregation, making naive or optimistic roll-ups a **provable error** in the model. |
| **Creative Mode Collapse (Premature Convergence)** | Advises teams to “brainstorm more,” add ideation checklists, or warn against fixation—creativity is audited post‑hoc. | **`Creative Abduction (B.5.2)`** bound to **`NQD‑CAL (C.18)`** and governed by **`E/E‑LOG (C.19)`** keeps hypothesis generation formally open (illumination‑style emitters, exploration quotas, selection lenses), while **`Creativity‑CHR (C.17)`** scores outputs on `Novelty`, `Use‑Value`, `Surprise`, and `ConstraintFit` inside a `U.BoundedContext`. Premature convergence becomes a **policy/modeling violation** (insufficient exploration or missing lenses), not a soft reminder.  |

FPF does not make a thinker immune to cognitive biases. Rather, it provides a disciplined, external environment for reasoning that channels cognitive effort productively. It provides the **`Canonical Reasoning Cycle (B.5)`**—a constructive path from a novel idea (Abduction) to a validated conclusion (Induction)—rather than just a set of warnings about wrong turns. **Creative ideation** is first‑class: **B.5.2.1** together with **C.17–C.19** replaces ad‑hoc brainstorming with measurable **Novelty–Quality–Diversity** search, complementing the assurance calculus.

In this way, FPF is not a replacement for critical thinking and creative thinking but its **engineering reinforcement**. It provides the architectural integrity, shared vocabulary, and formal discipline necessary to move from merely avoiding mistakes and generate ad hoc ideas to reliably generating trustworthy and auditable insights.

## Thinking Through Writing: The FPF Discipline of Conceptual Work *(non-normative)*

A core challenge of any rigorous intellectual effort is that thought itself is intangible. While many frameworks focus on managing data, process, or team activities, FPF uniquely focuses on architecting the *act of reasoning itself*. It achieves this by providing a discipline of "thinking through writing"—a method for giving thought a concrete, shareable, and auditable form. The diverse formats found within the framework—the Cards, Tables, Records, and Specifications—are the instruments for this discipline.

At its heart, FPF requires what might be metaphorically called "pencil and paper." To engage with the framework is to externalize one's reasoning, moving it from the fleeting space of internal cognition to a persistent medium where it can be inspected, challenged, and refined. This "writing" is not a by-product of thinking; it *is* the thinking. The act of filling out a **Role Description Card** or constructing a **Concept-Set Table** is not mere documentation; it is the cognitive work of making distinctions, declaring invariants, and justifying relationships. These forms give shape and persistence to thought.

This discipline is operationalized through a rich vocabulary of conceptual forms, each tailored for a specific cognitive task. *Cards* serve to define and scope individual concepts: a `Context Card` (F.1) fixes the semantic boundaries of a domain, while a `Role Description Card` (F.4) specifies the invariants of a particular behavioral role or status. *Tables* are used to compare and synthesize knowledge across these boundaries, with the `Unified Term Sheet (UTS)` (F.17) providing the canonical, human-readable summary of how concepts align. *Records*, such as the `Design-Rationale Record (DRR)` (E.9), create a durable, auditable history of *why* a decision was made, capturing the context and trade-offs. Finally, *Contracts* and *Specifications* make rules explicit, from the high-level `Architheory Signature` (A.6) that governs a plug-in's behavior to the detailed `Conformance Checklists` that conclude every pattern. Each form is a distinct instrument in the FPF toolkit, designed to isolate and clarify a specific aspect of a complex problem.

It is critical, however, to understand the precise nature of this "writing." The FPF constitution is built on a deliberate separation of concerns that grants teams maximum freedom in their operational practices.

*   **FPF is Not a Tooling or Notation Mandate.** The "pencil and paper" are a metaphor. FPF is fundamentally agnostic to the medium. Whether a team uses a physical whiteboard, a shared text document, a wiki, a version-controlled set of Markdown files, or a sophisticated modeling tool is an implementation detail that lies outside the conceptual core. The framework's value resides in the *structure of the thought* that these forms demand, not in any specific rendering. This is the essence of the **Notational Independence** guard-rail (E.5.2).

*   **FPF is Not a Team Workflow or Data Governance Policy.** The framework does not prescribe how a team should run its meetings, manage its repositories, or version its files. It is not a substitute for methodologies like Agile or for data governance policies. Rather, FPF provides the **conceptual content** that these processes act upon. A team can use its existing Agile workflow to manage the creation of a **Design-Rationale Record (DRR)**, and its existing data governance policy to manage the storage of an **Unified Term Sheet (UTS)**. FPF provides the *what*—the structure of a sound argument—not the *how* of team logistics.

The purpose of this discipline is to augment both individual and collective cognition. For the individual, the written artifact acts as an extension of working memory, making it possible to hold and manipulate far more complex models than one could in their head alone. For the team, these shared, tangible artifacts create a common conceptual space. They become the stable ground upon which collective reasoning can occur—a shared object that can be debated, annotated, and iteratively improved.

This flexibility is by design. The conceptual contract of a **Role Description Card** is fixed by FPF, but its physical implementation is a project-level decision. One team might manage their cards in a simple spreadsheet, another in a relational database, and a third in a formal ontology. All can be fully FPF-conformant because they honor the conceptual structure, regardless of the underlying data-handling choices.

Ultimately, the diverse forms within FPF are not bureaucratic artifacts to be produced; they are conceptual instruments to be used. They provide the minimal necessary structure to turn fleeting insights into durable, shareable, and contestable knowledge. They are the grammar that allows a team to write its thoughts, and then, together, to edit them towards truth.

## Descriptive Ontologies vs. A Thinking-Oriented Architecture *(non-normative)*

The First Principles Framework (FPF) shares a goal with classical upper ontologies (e.g., **Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)**, **DOLCE**): to provide a universal, unified language that cuts across disciplinary silos. Yet they pursue this from fundamentally different starting points. Understanding this distinction is key to grasping FPF’s unique purpose.

A classical upper ontology aims to create a logically consistent **inventory of what exists**. Its primary task is descriptive metaphysics: partitioning reality into fundamental categories (like *continuants* vs. *occurrents*, *objects* vs. *processes*) and defining their relations. The result is a rigorous, hierarchical map optimized for data integration and preventing category errors. It tells you, with formal precision, that an *engine* is not a *process of running*, and that a *hole* is a *quality*, not an *object*.

FPF, by contrast, is a **thinking-oriented architecture**. Its primary task is not to describe the world but to **orchestrate the process of reasoning about the world**. It is less a map and more a compass and checklist, guiding an agent's attention toward the decisive aspects of a problem—objectives, trust, emergence, and dynamics—before any taxonomy is imposed. This resolves a core tension: descriptive ontologies become static encyclopedias, while FPF's generative patterns interlink into an evolvable language for action.

The following contrasts highlight this shift:

| Characteristic | Classical Upper Ontology | FPF's Thinking Architecture |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Task** | Logically consistent inventory of entity types. | Generative scaffold for reasoning and decision-making. |
| **Primary Question** | “What is this?” | “How do we reason about this, and why does it matter?” |
| **Guiding Artefact** | Taxonomy & logical axioms. | **Patterns** (context ▲ problem ▲ solution + CC). |
| **Validation Mode** | Consistency in formal reasoners. | Satisfying **Conformance Checklist** for goals, trust, emergence. |
| **Change Driver** | Domain evolution → new classes. | Cognitive evolution → new reasoning patterns. |
| **Cross-Disciplinarity** | Challenging: each domain = new branch. | Built-in: patterns span ≥3 domains (C-1 Universality). |
| **Physical Grounding** | Optional; often abstract. | Mandatory: material Transformer anchor (e.g., in Pattern D.1 Mereology). |

#### Why FPF Prioritizes Patterns
FPF chooses patterns to address limitations in descriptive approaches:
1. **Objective Alignment**: Complex endeavors fail from unstated goals; FPF mandates patterns for objectives and conflicts (e.g., Pattern D.4 Canonical Loop), ensuring reasoning starts with "why."
2. **Trust Over Truth Tables**: Systems need epistemic scores (Pattern D.3); patterns incorporate trust dynamics, not just class membership.
3. **Open-Ended Adaptability**: Ontologies ossify; FPF embeds evolution (Pattern C.4), allowing patterns to mutate via Design Rationale Records.
4. **Didactic Transparency**: Each pattern includes a quotable closer and CC, providing mental hooks—an embodiment of Pillar P-2.

Building on metasystem transitions (Turchin), FPF integrates feedback loops and layered control, making it a natural extension for domains like engineering and biology.

#### Prophylactic Clarifications
- *FPF does not reject descriptive ontologies*: They plug in as domain taxonomies via Role-Projection (B.5.3). What FPF rejects is letting taxonomy dictate the epistemic agenda.
- *FPF is not a prescriptive checklist*: Patterns are enabling constraints—adopt subsets as needed, honoring CCs and guard-rails.

In bridging these worlds, FPF transforms ontology from a map of existence into a compass for thought.

> *"Where a taxonomy tells you what is, a pattern language reminds you why it matters—and how to change your mind when it no longer does."*

### FPF and 1980s Expert Systems: Shared Ambition, Different Contract *(non‑normative)*

The ambition that fuels the First Principles Framework is not new. It shares a direct intellectual lineage with the grand "expert system" projects of the 1980s. Both endeavors pursue the same fundamental goal: to capture expert knowledge in a formal "knowledge representation" language, making it explicit, reusable, auditable and capable of driving decisions. FPF can be seen as a modern realization of that very ambition, but one that operates under a profoundly different contract, shaped by the lessons learned over the last four decades.

The original expert system paradigm was predicated on logic-based languages. However, the industry later recognized that modern, multi-paradigm programming languages—with their rich object-oriented and functional constructs—were often more expressive and practical for representing complex knowledge than their purely logical predecessors. In parallel, "ontologies" found their primary role not as dynamic reasoning engines, but as sophisticated schemas for data, leaving the intricate work of inference to powerful algorithms. The complex, reliable software that runs our world today is, in many ways, the true heir to the expert system dream.

FPF embraces this modern reality. It is a "standard for thinking"—a knowledge representation language that is neither a programming language nor a formal logic, but a structured, semi-formal medium designed for human cognition and machine-parsability alike. It inherits the spirit of standardization, where the goal is to make compliance and reasoning tractable through a more formal mode of expression. To make this standard both rigorous and ergonomically sound, FPF's architecture has been intentionally "tuned" with several key disciplines:
* A Pattern Language Form. Every normative rule is presented not as a naked axiom, but within an Alexanderian pattern that exposes the problem, the competing forces, the solution, and its consequences. This makes the why behind every rule an integral part of the framework itself.
* The "Tell-Show-Show" Principle. Abstract concepts are immediately grounded with concrete, archetypal examples (Archetypal Grounding, E.7). A universal rule is first told, then shown in the context of a physical U.System and an epistemic U.Epeme, making the framework's trans-disciplinary claims tangible.
* Stratified Lexical Registers. FPF maintains a strict separation between a Tech register for formal precision and a Plain register for didactic clarity (Lexical Stratification, E.10). This allows the framework to be simultaneously accessible to managers and auditable by specialists.
* An Explicit Constitution. The entire framework is governed by a small, stable constitution (Part E), which defines the rules for its own evolution. This ensures that FPF remains a living, adaptable system, not a static text.

**What they share.** Both FPF and 1980s expert systems pursue a stubbornly practical aim: **make expert judgment explicit, reusable, and auditable**. They do it by **naming reasoning moves** and **constraining how they connect**. In that sense, FPF’s patterns (with their Conformance Checklists) and classic rule bases (with their production rules) spring from the same impulse: tame complexity by **codifying disciplined thinking**.

**Where they part ways.** Expert systems were **inference engines**. Their contract was: *given a closed set of facts and rules, compute a conclusion* (forward/backward chaining over a rule base). FPF is an **architecture for thinking**. Its contract is: *given an open world, build safe **islands of closure** where decisions are justified, and make the justification itself composable, evolvable, and testable*. In FPF the primary deliverable is not an answer but a **well‑formed reasoning trail** that can be checked, extended, and aligned across domains.

**Different unit of computation:** 
* **Expert system:** *fire rules → derive new facts*.
* **FPF:** *apply patterns → satisfy checks*. FPF’s “computation” is the systematic satisfaction of **pattern‑level invariants** (e.g., separation of Role–Method–Work; evidence anchoring; cross‑scale consistency). The outcome is a **go/no‑go** on conformance and a **trace** back to claims, roles, methods, work, and evidence.

**Different world assumptions.**
Expert systems typically presume a **single closed world** so that non‑derived facts are false. FPF assumes an **open world by default** and teaches how to **construct local closed worlds** on purpose—via **Bounded Contexts** with explicit invariants, role lattices, and acceptance policies—so engineering decisions remain crisp without pretending to global completeness.

**Different kernel shape.**
Classic stacks bundled **knowledge base + inference engine + working memory**. FPF offers a **micro‑kernel** plus **architheory plug‑ins** and **pattern contracts**:

| Classic expert system | FPF counterpart (essence)                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rule base (if‑then)   | **Named patterns** with **Conformance Checklists**; **Role/Capability/Service** separation frames *who/what/how* cleanly.                                        |
| Inference engine      | **Reasoning & evolution loops** (abductive–deductive–inductive; run–observe–refine–deploy) orchestrate *how* conclusions mature, not *which* conclusion to pick. |
| Working memory        | **Work & Evidence ledgers** (execution facts live in **Work**; claims in **Epistemes**; links are **evidence‑anchored** and decay‑aware).                        |

**From “explain *why the engine fired*” to “explain *why the model is justified*.”** Expert systems popularized explanation facilities that replayed fired rules. FPF generalizes explanation into **assurance**: every normative claim must point to **evidence artefacts**, pass **trust/assurance calculus**, and obey **didactic and lexical guard‑rails**. Explanations cease to be transcripts of inference and become **auditable contracts** between design‑time intent and run‑time facts.

**Reflexivity without self‑deception.** Expert systems struggle with **self‑modification** (changing the rule base that is also judging the change). FPF bakes in a **reflexive split**: **external transformers** act on models; **Design‑Rationale Records** govern change; **temporal duality** keeps design‑time artefacts (e.g., MethodDescription) separate from run‑time artefacts (Work). This lets teams evolve the “rules of thought” while preserving a clean audit trail.

**Brittleness vs evolvability.** Classic rule bases often became brittle as rules multiplied. FPF’s **ontological parsimony**, **role algebra** (≤, ⊥, ⊗), **characterisation spaces**, and **state graphs** push complexity into **small, local, named contracts** that compose safely across scales. Instead of a monolithic rule web, FPF yields **lego‑blocks with fitness functions**.

**How to read this in practice.** If you *do* embed a rule engine inside an FPF project, treat it as a **system bearing a role** that executes a **method** within a **bounded context**. Its outputs are **epistemes** that must earn **evidence roles**; its operational runs are **work** that will be evaluated against **acceptance clauses** of a declared **service**. In other words, an “expert system” becomes **one transformer among many** inside a larger, governed architecture of thought.

**Bottom line.** Expert systems tried to *replace* expert thinking with machine inference on a closed rule set. FPF aims to *upgrade* expert thinking by giving humans and machines a **shared, evolvable operating system** for making, testing, and revising claims—under explicit roles, scopes, and evidence—without collapsing the open world into a brittle fiction. FPF is a scaffold of semi-formal documents (patterns, standard-like) of exceptional clarity. These patterns serve as a bridge, making FPF understandable to other humans — and structured enough to be understood by contemporary AI system. 

### The “big storylines” unique to FPF (load‑bearing commitments)
1. **Holonic kernel with physical anchoring**  —  everything that composes is a `U.Holon`; every change is enacted by an **external transformer** (A.1; A.12).
2. **Role–Method–Work split with time duality** — prevents the endemic plan/reality conflation; only `U.Work` carries actuals (A.4; A.15.1–.2).
3. **Assurance as a first‑class calculus** — evidence roles, decay, and weakest‑link composition make “trust” computable and auditable (B.3; A.10).
4. **Algebra of aggregation (Γ) with cross‑scale invariants** — conservative composition that generalizes from pumps to proofs (B.1).
5. **Local meaning, global alignment** — `U.BoundedContext` islands and explicit Bridges with **congruence‑loss** turn “it depends” into a contract (A.1.1; F.9).
6. **Micro‑kernel + architheories** — CAL/LOG/CHR plug‑ins extend capability without contaminating the core (A.5–A.6; Part C).
7. **Publication contract & guard‑rails** — Core ↔ Tooling ↔ Pedagogy split, notational independence, and Lexical Discipline prevent conceptual drift (E.5; E.10).
8. **Open‑ended evolution by design** — DRR, evidence refresh, **and explicit creative search (NQD + E/E‑LOG)** keep the system alive without ossification (A.4; B.4; **C.18; C.19;** E.6; E.9; B.3.4).

**What FPF is**: a **generative, testable architecture for thinking** that any domain can inhabit.
**What FPF is not**: a repository of domain facts, a rule‑chaining engine, a methodology du jour, or a notation.

### Transdisciplinarity as a Meta‑Theory of Thinking  

*Modern complexity lives at the junction of silos.*  A climate model borrows genetics to track pathogens; a venture‑capital pitch cites thermodynamic “runway.” Yet each field guards its own mathematics, and translation costs soar.  **FPF answers this tension by treating transdisciplinarity as a meta‑theory of thinking itself** — a language for designing reasoning, not another specialist dialect.

 An FPF **architheory** is a *theory about theories*: Systemic Calculus abstracts part‑whole composition; Knowledge Dynamics captures epistemic trust.  These patterns act as **generative scaffolds**: a biologist modelling adaptation, an engineer designing resilience, and a strategist planning pivot options all reach for the same invariant trio — *objective ▲ feedback loop ▲ trust metric*.  FPF names that trio explicitly (`U.Objective`, Canonical Evolution Loop, Unified Trust Model) and **requires universality** *(Principle C‑1: at least three heterogeneous domains)*.

The synthesis is physical, not metaphoric. *Constructive mereology* (Kit Fine) and *Constructor Theory* (Deutsch & Marletto) insist that every whole arises through a **material Transformer as transformer of matter and information**—a sensor grid that binds “crowd‑flow” to joules, a data pipeline tying employee action to market response. Pattern **D.1 Aggregation & Mereology** formalises this anchor; without it, abstractions cannot cross scales.

The idea rests on a long lineage:

* Aristotle’s first principles and Descartes’ methodical doubt supply the goal of irreducible axioms.
* Popper’s conjecture‑and‑refutation loop and Feynman’s “don’t fool yourself” ground FPF’s **abductive primacy**.
* Christopher Alexander’s pattern language and the **Gang of Four** show how named solutions seed generative design.
* Ashby’s cybernetic layering and Turchin’s *metasystem transition* illuminate cross‑scale control.

Together they yield what we call the **Congruence Hypothesis**: different domains often optimise the *same* abstract driver—thermodynamic *free energy*, ML *loss*, evolutionary *fitness*—all instances of `U.Objective`.

*“Disciplines divide the world; meta‑theories remind us it is one conversation.”*

See **E.5** (Guard‑Rails), **A.4** (Temporal Duality & Open‑Ended Evolution), **B.5.3** (Role‑Projection / Type‑&‑Role calculus), and **B.3** (Trust & Assurance Calculus) for formal definitions and Conformance Checklists.

### Artefact Families as a Publication Contract  *(non-normative)*

*A spec that speaks only to machines soon alienates humans; a tutorial that ignores formal rules breeds cargo‑cult practice.* To keep both rigor and readability, FPF cleanly separates its artefacts into **three families bound by one‑way dependencies**—an architectural pattern as vital as any algebra in the Core.

---

| Artifact Family                               | Purpose (mini‑definition)                                                               | May depend on | Must never depend on |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| **Conceptual Core**  *(The Canon)* | Normative pattern language; tool‑agnostic; guarded by the **DevOps Lexical Firewall**.  | —             | Tooling, Pedagogy    |
| **Tooling Reference**              | Executable artefacts—linters, simulators, schemas—that **verify Conformance Checklist**. | Core          | Pedagogy             |
| **Pedagogical Companion**          | Tutorials, playbooks, Intellect‑Stack exercises that turn patterns into action.         | Core, Tooling | —                    |

---

This stack obeys the **Principle of Unidirectional Dependency** (`pat:guardrail/unidir-dependency`): arrows point *upward* only.  A new linter can evolve without touching a single pattern; a workshop can cite the linter, but the Canon remains untouched.  The design mirrors W3C’s *Recommendation → Test Suite → Note* split and the Linux kernel’s user‑space boundary—cross‑domain proof that the contract is robust.

Physical grounding persists.  A linter executable is a *Transformer* that binds abstract CC‑Style.1 to tangible bytecode; a classroom lab is a *Transformer* converting Canonical Evolution Loop into real telemetry.  Thus even supportive layers respect **Pattern D.1 Aggregation & Mereology**.

1. *Truth* lives in the Conceptual Core.
2. *Verification* happens in Tooling.
3. *Explanation* blooms in Pedagogy.

Any proposed change starts as a **Design Rationale Record (DRR)**, the formal mechanism for governing change (E.9), Tooling updates its checks, and Pedagogy updates examples — preserving the conceptual integrity mandated by the Unidirectional Dependency guard-rail (E.5.3) and preventing “conceptual drift.”

*“Layers divide labour; the contract keeps the whole mind intact.”*

### Intellect Stack (informative Overview) 

*Complex problems fail more often from mis‑aligned competencies than from missing facts.* Inside one brain—or one team—model builders, testers, and decision makers can behave like separate departments. The **Intellect Stack** offers a **layered map of cognitive skills**, showing how FPF’s architheories combine into an “operating system for thought.”

The stack is **pedagogical, not prescriptive**: you may enter at any layer, but mastery grows when the layers reinforce one another. Each rung names a domain‑agnostic capability (`U.Capability`) and points to the patterns that realise it.

Conceptually, the Intellect Stack is formalized as a non-normative **Characterization (CHR) package**. This package defines types such as `U.IntellectLayer` (e.g., *Logician*, *Strategist*) and `U.Competency`, which are then linked to the kernel's `U.Capability` via a `hasCapability` mapping. This ensures that while the stack remains a flexible teaching tool, its structure is coherent and formally grounded.

| Layer                          | Core question                          | Key patterns & exemplary domains                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 · Structure & Reality**    | *What exists and how is it bounded?*   | **Kind-CAL** for universal categories; **Sys‑CAL** for system boundaries. <br>Physics (control volumes), Software (static types), Ecology (trophic levels). |
| **2 · Knowledge & Reasoning**  | *Why should we trust this claim?*      | **KD‑CAL** (F‑G‑R characteristics), **Arg‑LOG** for formal argument. <br>AI (model validation), Evidence‑based policy.                                                 |
| **3 · Action & Execution**     | *How do we turn intent into change?*   | **Agent‑CHR**, **Method‑CAL**, **Resrc‑CAL**. <br>Robotics (action plans), DevOps (pipelines), Urban planning (resource flows).                             |
| **4 · Strategy & Rationality** | *Which option wins under uncertainty?* | **Decsn‑CAL**—`U.Decision`, causal models. <br>Finance (risk fronts), Military wargaming.                                                                   |
| **5 · Governance & Purpose**   | *Why act at all; what is permissible?* | **Norm‑CAL**—`U.Objective`, value conflicts. <br>Bioethics, Sustainability metrics.                                                                         |

Every layer remains **physically grounded**: an abstract *method* references a *material Transformer* (Pattern D.1) such as a laboratory rig or CI runner that proves the method can exist.  Without that anchor, the skill is rhetoric, not capability.

The stack mirrors software’s architecture layer stacks. **A.5 Open‑Ended Kernel & Architheory Layering** lets new layers emerge via **Design Rationale Records (E.9)**, keeping the map alive.

A full description of the Intellect Stack and its layers resides in the Pedagogical Companion.

*“A stack without mastery is scaffolding; mastery without a stack is improvisation—FPF supplies the ladder that turns skills into intelligence.”*

### Purpose, Scope, and Explicit Non‑Goals  *(non-normative)*

*A framework that aims at everything excels at nothing.* To keep **Cognitive Elegance (P‑1)** and **Pragmatic Utility (P‑7)** intact, FPF draws a deliberate line around what it serves—and what it refuses to be.

---

**Purpose – an operating system for thought**
FPF’s mission is to supply a **generative scaffold** that carries a raw idea—whether from a physicist, a product‑manager, or an AI agent—toward a reproducible, auditable impact on the physical world. It does so by offering:

* a **micro‑kernel of first principles**—postulates that are universal (SCR in ≥ 3 heterogeneous domains per C‑1), falsifiable, and non‑derivable inside the framework;
* **architheories as meta‑theories of thinking**, such as Systemic Calculus for composition and Knowledge Dynamics for epistemic evolution;
* **patterns with Conformance Checklists** that quantify objectives, trust, emergence, and evolution;
* **Design Rationale Records (DRRs)** that govern safe, auditable evolution of the Canon;
* a **Constitution**—the **Eleven Pillars (E.2)** plus the **Guard‑Rails (E.5.\*)**—that constrains all normative content.

**Scope – tool‑agnostic, normative patterns only**
This Core Specification defines:

1. **Universal concepts** (`U.Type`, `U.Objective`, `U.Decision`, …).
2. **Algebras of composition** (aggregation, role‑projection, metasystem transition).
3. **Invariants of change**—rules that safeguard cross‑scale consistency as systems evolve.

Everything here is **free of implementation detail**; verification lives in Tooling, guidance in Pedagogy. Physical grounding is mandatory: every abstraction must reference a *material Transformer* (Pattern D.1).

**Explicit Non‑Goals – enforced by guard‑rails**

| Non‑Goal                      | Rationale / Pattern link                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain encyclopaedia**      | FPF hosts no physics constants or finance taxonomies; import such knowledge via Type & Role Calculus (`D‑0`).                                  |
| **Single mathematical dogma** | Patterns are expressible in multiple formalisms; **Notational Independence** (`E.5.2`) forbids locking into OWL, JSON‑LD, or category theory. |
| **Prescribed tool stack**     | Implementation choices belong to the **Tooling Reference**; the Core never cites CI pipelines or file formats (**DevOps Lexical Firewall `E.5.1`**). |
| **Step‑by‑step tutorial**     | Pedagogical Companion carries worked examples and Intellect‑Stack exercises; the Core remains concise and normative.                           |

This boundary avoids the fate of “grand unifiers” that collapsed under their own encyclopaedic weight. FPF instead follows the lesson of Euclidean geometry and the TCP/IP suite: a **small set of powerful, generative rules** outlives any single domain fashion.

*“Purpose without scope is day‑dream; scope without non‑goals is sprawl—FPF charts the narrow ridge where ideas turn into reliable action.”*

### How to Navigate Architectural \[A] and Definitional \[D] Patterns *(non-normative)*

*A dictionary lists words; a grammar shows you how to speak.* FPF is written as a grammar of patterns, and fluency comes from knowing when to read a column and when to grab a brick.

**Pattern taxonomy**

| Tag                            | Template (payload)                                                                                              | Read it when you need …                                                     | Typical length |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **\[A] Architectural Pattern** | Seven‑part deep dive: *Context → Problem → Forces → Solution → Conformance Checklist → Consequences → Rationale* | a cross‑cutting rule—Aggregation algebra, Scalable Formality, Unified Trust | 1‑3 pages      |
| **\[D] Definitional Pattern**  | Light form: *Term → Definition → Relations → CC*                                                                | a precise meaning—`U.TypeNode`, `verifiedBy`, `U.Objective`                 | ½ page         |

(A‑patterns answer *why & how*; D‑patterns answer *what*.)

**Navigation heuristics — “Zoom Out → Zoom In → Trace Links”**

1. **Zoom out.** Skim the ToC for \[A] clusters. Pick the pattern whose subtitle states your dilemma.
2. **Zoom in.** Inside that \[A] pattern, bold small‑caps terms (`U.Decision`) hyperlink to their \[D] definitions in a Glossary. Read only the meaning you need; bounce back.
3. **Trace links.** The **Pattern Catalogue** shows a graph: hover “Unified Trust” to see it depends on Anchoring Relations \[D] and cites Conformance Checklist CC‑Trust.\*—use this to audit impacts before you extend a rule.

**Pro tips**

* **Problem‑first?** Start with forces in an \[A] pattern; they tell you which D‑terms are essential. 
* **Term‑first?** Begin in Glossary; each D‑pattern lists “Used‑By” links back to governing A‑patterns.
* **Evolve.** If neither A nor D covers your case, draft a **Design Rationale Record** referencing the closest CC, then propose a new pattern or variant—never patch the Canon directly.

*Read D for the word, A for the music; let the hyperlinks conduct the score.*

# Part A – Kernel Architecture Cluster
## A.1 Holonic Foundation: Entity → Holon  \[A] 

> *“Name the thing without smuggling in its parts.”*

### 1 · Context

The first epistemic act in any discipline is to **point**: “that thing, not the background.” Physics calls the pointed object a *system*, biology an *organism*, information science an *artifact*, philosophy an *entity*. Reusing any one of these across domains drags hidden assumptions and yields nonsense like *“What is the mass of a system of equations?”* or *“Where is the network interface of a moral theory?”*
FPF therefore starts from a **minimal, domain‑agnostic root** that makes such category errors impossible **by construction** and gives engineers and managers a clean, uniform handle for composition, boundaries and interfaces.

### 2 · Problem

If FPF treats **system** as the universal root, two recurrent failure modes appear:

1. **Category Error** — physical affordances get projected onto abstract artifacts (ports on theories; kilogram‑mass of paradigms).
2. **Mereological Over‑reach** — part–whole calculus is applied to genuinely atomic entities (prime numbers, elementary charges), producing meaningless “sub‑parts.”

A robust kernel must **separate identity from structure**: first say *what can be singled out*, then say *what has parts*.

### 3 · Forces

| Force                         | Tension                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs Intuition** | Precision of a new root term (*Holon*) ↔ practitioner expectation of familiar words (*System*, *Theory*).  |
| **Purity vs Pragmatism**      | Clean formalism ↔ immediate usability for engineers, scientists, managers.                                 |
| **Structure vs Identity**     | Need to talk about atoms with zero parts ↔ need full mereology for composites.                             |

### 4 · Solution — A three‑tier root (Entity ⊃ Holon ⊃ {System, Episteme})

FPF adopts a **three‑tier root ontology** refining Koestler’s “holon,” with crisp boundaries and safe composition. The presentation follows the \[A]‑template and style mandates (Context → Problem → Forces → Solution → …; mandatory *Archetypal Grounding*).

**4.1  `U.Entity` — Primitive of Distinction**
Anything that can be individuated and referenced. **No structural assumptions.** Use when you must name “a something” without committing to having parts.

**4.2  `U.Holon` — Unit of Composition**
A `U.Entity` that is *simultaneously* **(a)** a whole composed of parts and **(b)** a part within a larger whole. Formally, `U.Holon ⊑ U.Entity`.
Operational requirements:

* A holon has **exactly one** `U.Boundary` that separates it from its environment.
* The universal aggregation operator **Γ** is **only** defined on sets of `U.Holon` (never on bare `U.Entity`).
  These constraints make composition rules uniform across domains and prevent Γ from being misapplied.

**4.3  Interface primitives: `U.Boundary` & `U.Interaction`**
Every holon is defined by **how** it is separated and **what** crosses the separation.

* **`U.Boundary`** — physical or conceptual surface delimiting the holon’s scope.
* **`U.Interaction`** — any flow of matter, energy, or information that crosses a boundary.
  **Canonical boundary kinds (with twin archetypes):**

| Kind          | Permitted exchanges             | `U.System` archetype               | `U.Episteme` archetype                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Open**      | Matter, energy, information     | Microservice exposing a public API | Public wiki editable by anyone                                |
| **Closed**    | Energy, information (no matter) | Sealed cooling loop in a server    | Version‑locked theory accepting new evidence but fixed axioms |
| **Permeable** | User‑filtered subset            | Cell membrane regulating ions      | Legal code allowing specific amendment classes only           |

This pair (`Boundary`, `Interaction`) makes interfaces explicit, reviewable, and testable across domains.

**4.4  Inside/Outside decision procedure**
To decide whether an entity **E** is *inside* a holon **H**, apply:

1. **Dependency test:** removing **E** breaks a core invariant of **H**.
2. **Interaction test:** **E** participates in causal loops wholly within **H**’s boundary.
3. **Emergence test:** **E** contributes to a novel collective property warranting **H** as a single unit.
   Fail all three → **E** is *outside*. This practical triage prevents “scope creep” and forces explicit modeling of environment vs interior.

**4.5  Archetypal sub‑holons**
FPF fixes two **archetypal** specializations to ground cross‑domain universality:

| Subtype                    | Essence                                                | Home architheory |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| **`U.System ⊑ U.Holon`**   | Physical, operational holon obeying conservation laws. | **Sys‑CAL**      |
| **`U.Episteme ⊑ U.Holon`** | Knowledge holon (axioms, evidence, argument graph).    | **KD‑CAL**       |

*Naming guideline:* keep “**System**” and “**Episteme**” for practitioner comfort; reserve **Holon** for meta‑level discourse and formal signatures.

### 5 · Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Holonic slot | **`U.System` — Water‑pump**            | **`U.Episteme` — Scientific theory**            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Identity** | Pump #37 stamped on the name‑plate     | “Newtonian Gravitation”, 1726 edition           |
| **Boundary** | Cast‑iron casing; inlet/outlet flanges | Axiomatic scope and vocabulary                  |
| **Parts**    | Motor, impeller, seals, housing        | Axioms, definitions, theorems, datasets         |
| **Whole**    | Operable assembly that moves fluid     | Coherent body of knowledge predicting phenomena |

Showing the **same structural slots** filled by a machine and a theory demonstrates the **substrate‑independent universality** of `U.Holon`. This is the didactic “Tell–Show–Show” anchor required by the Style‑Guide for \[A]‑patterns. 

---

### 6 · Common Modelling Anti‑Patterns (manager’s quick checks)

1. **“Ports on a theory.”** Treating a proof corpus as if it had physical connectors. *Fix:* model `U.Interaction` only across **boundaries**; for epistemes, interactions are **symbolic flows** via carriers and citations (see A.10), not power or mass.
2. **“Document edited itself.”** Assigning actions to an episteme. *Fix:* actions are executed by a **system bearing a role** (A.12/A.15); epistemes are transformed **via external transformers** acting on their **symbol carriers**.
3. **“Parts everywhere.”** Forcing a part–whole onto atomic entities (e.g., prime numbers). *Fix:* if no meaningful parts exist, stay at `U.Entity`; apply Γ only to `U.Holon`.
4. **“Scope ≡ section.”** Using “scope” as a text region rather than a modeled boundary. *Fix:* define a `U.Boundary` and state what crosses it (`U.Interaction`).

> **When in doubt:** first decide **what is a holon**, then state **its boundary**, then list **what crosses**. Roles and methods come *after* (see A.2 and A.15).

### 7 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                    | Purpose / Notes                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑A1.1** | Any modelled object that exhibits a part–whole structure **MUST** be typed as `U.Holon` or its subtype.                                                                        | Prevents applying Γ to atomic entities; makes aggregation well‑typed.                                                  |
| **CC‑A1.2** | Each `U.Holon` **MUST** reference exactly one `U.Boundary` and declare its boundary kind (*open / closed / permeable*).                                                        | Enables boundary inheritance and environmental contracts; aligns with the canonical boundary kinds introduced in A.1.  |
| **CC‑A1.3** | Domain architheories **MUST** explicitly subtype their root concept (`U.System`, `U.Episteme`, …) from `U.Holon`.                                                              | Ensures cross‑domain compatibility of aggregation and emergence patterns.                                              |
| **CC‑A1.4** | Inside/Outside decisions for any candidate part **SHALL** be justified by the three‑step test (Dependency → Interaction → Emergence) and recorded with the boundary reference. | Makes holon membership auditable and repeatable; uses A.1’s decision procedure.                                        |
| **CC‑A1.5** | Behavioural roles (**including** `TransformerRole`) **SHALL** attach only to `U.System` (the bearer), not to `U.Holon` in general and not to `U.Episteme`.                     | Preserves Strict Distinction and prevents category errors; episteme roles are classificatory only.                     |
| **CC‑A1.6** | Do **not** model acting groups as sets. If a grouping is expected to **act**, it **SHALL** be modelled as a **collective system** (with boundary, role, Method/Work).          | Distinguishes `MemberOf` (collection) from mereology; prepares for A.14 Portions/Phases.                               |
| **CC‑A1.7** | The universal aggregation operator **Γ** **SHALL** be applied **only** to sets of `U.Holon` within a single declared temporal scope (design **or** run) and context.           | Prevents “chimera” graphs; routes order/time to Γ\_ctx / Γ\_time (B.1.4).                                              |
| **CC‑A1.8** | Prose and diagrams **SHALL** follow the naming guideline: use **Holon** for meta‑level discourse; prefer **System / Episteme** in practitioner‑level statements.               | Reduces jargon friction; keeps signatures precise and text readable.                                                   |

> *Audit tip.* CC‑A1.5 is frequently violated when authors write “holon bearing TransformerRole”. Rewrite to “**system** bearing TransformerRole” or provide the explicit `U.RoleAssignment`. See A.2/A.15 for role mechanics.

### 8 · Consequences (informative)

| Benefits                                                                                                                                                         | Trade‑offs / Mitigations                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Eliminates category errors** across physical and abstract realms by cleanly separating identity (Entity), structure (Holon), and behaviour (Role/Method/Work). | Introduces the unfamiliar term **Holon**; mitigated by Tell‑Show‑Show pedagogy and dual archetypal examples (System/Episteme).  |
| **Unifies aggregation**: a single algebra Γ composes pumps, proofs, genomes, and teams under one roof.                                                           | Requires refactoring legacy “System‑only” language; addressed by A.2/A.3 role calculus and the Γ‑family in B.1.                 |
| **Predictable extension point**: CAL/LOG/CHR architheories add constraints without touching the core types.                                                      | Imposes discipline on boundary declarations; mitigated by boundary kinds and the Inside/Outside test.                           |

---

### 9 · Rationale with cross‑domain corroboration (post‑2015, informative)

The separation **Entity → Holon → {System, Episteme}** is not only ontologically clean; it is **empirically validated across domains since 2015**:

* **Compositional open systems.** Category‑theoretic treatments show that *boundaried* components compose safely (decorated cospans, open systems). This mirrors Γ’s reliance on declared boundaries. *(Fong & Spivak, 2019; Baez & Courser, 2017)*
* **Microservices & bounded contexts.** Modern software architecture stresses strong service boundaries and local reasoning as the route to evolvability—our `U.Boundary` and Inside/Outside test encode the same discipline. *(Newman, 2021; Vernon, 2022)*
* **FAIR & provenance.** Data/knowledge communities require explicit distinction between **content** and **carrier**, and auditable provenance—precisely the System/Episteme + SCR split used in A.1/A.10. *(Wilkinson et al., 2016; Boeckhout et al., 2018)*
* **Digital Twin / Thread.** Engineering practice since late‑2010s emphasises the run↔design seam and boundary‑consistent aggregation of subsystems—formalised in our Γ‑family and boundary inheritance rules. *(Grieves & Vickers, 2017; NIST DT/Thread reports 2019‑2021)*
* **Layered control of CPS.** Contract‑based, multi‑rate architectures justify explicit holon boundaries and scale transitions—feeding directly into B.2 Meta‑Holon Transition. *(Matni et al., 2024)*

These streams converge on one point: **make boundaries and composition first‑class** and separate **what a thing is** from **what it is doing here‑and‑now**—the heart of A.1/A.2.

### 10 · Relations

* **Builds / Grounds:**

  * **A.2 Role Taxonomy** — A.1 provides the substantial characteristic (`Holon`), A.2 introduces the functional characteristic (`Role` and `U.RoleAssignment`). Together they prevent role/type explosion and keep agency contextual.
  * **A.7 Strict Distinction (Clarity Lattice)** — A.1 supplies the *slots* (Entity/Holon/System/Episteme); A.7 guards their separation in prose and models, stopping Object ≠ Description ≠ Carrier conflations.
  * **A.14 Advanced Mereology: Portions & Phases** — A.1’s holon substrate is the target of A.14’s edge discipline (`ComponentOf`, `ConstituentOf`, `PortionOf`, `PhaseOf`); only mereological subtypes build holarchies.

* **Interacts with the Γ‑family (B‑cluster):**

  * **B.1 Universal Algebra of Aggregation** — Γ is defined **on holons** and respects CC‑A1.\*; Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time carry order and temporal composition, Γ\_work handles resource ledgers.
  * **B.2 Meta‑Holon Transition (MHT)** — uses A.1’s boundary and Inside/Outside rules to decide when aggregation yields a **new** whole with novel properties.
  * **B.3 Trust & Assurance Calculus** — evidence attaches to carriers (SCR/RSCR) of epistemes; assurance levels depend on A.1/A.10 alignment.
  * **B.4 Canonical Evolution Loop** — operationalises the **design↔run** seam at holon boundaries; observation itself is an external transformation across a boundary.

* **Specialised by architheories:** `U.System` (Sys‑CAL) and `U.Episteme` (KD‑CAL) are archetypal sub‑holons that supply domain‑specific invariants while inheriting A.1’s boundary and aggregation duties.

*Without the holon, parts drift; without the role, purpose evaporates.* (Carry this epigraph with A.1 to cue the A.2 hand‑off.)


### Pattern A.1.1 — `U.BoundedContext`: The Semantic Frame \[D]

#### 1 · Term & Definition

*   **Term:** `U.BoundedContext`
*   **Definition:** A **`U.BoundedContext`** is a `U.Holon` that serves as an explicit **semantic frame of reference**. It defines a boundary within which a specific set of models, roles, rules, and language is self-consistent and authoritative. It is the FPF's formal mechanism for localizing meaning and managing complexity by partitioning a larger conceptual space into smaller, coherent, and independently governable domains.

#### 2 · Forces

### 2.1 · Prophylactic clarification — Context vs Domain
To prevent a common category error, **Domain** and **U.BoundedContext** are **not synonyms** in FPF.

| Characteristic | **Domain** (e.g., Physics, Law, Automotive Engineering) | **U.BoundedContext** (e.g., `AirTrafficControl_2025`, `Theory:QuantumMechanics`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature** | An **external field** of practice/knowledge that exists independently of any model. | An **internal FPF holon**: a named semantic “Context” with its own vocabulary and rules about a slice of a domain. |
| **Role in FPF** | Provides **grounding** for applicability and cross‑domain universality of the kernel. | Provides **local meaning and separation**: a semantic firewall where words and rules are coherent and unambiguous. |
| **Relationship** | One domain can have **many** valid perspectives. | A bounded context **hosts** one such perspective (Glossary, Invariants, local Role taxonomy, Bridges). |

**Normative anchor (didactic form):**  
The `context` field in any `U.RoleAssignment` **MUST** reference a **U.BoundedContext**, **never** a broad domain label.  
*Think “specific room” (e.g., `Hospital.OR_2025`), not “the whole building” (e.g., “Healthcare”).*

**Manager’s one‑liner:** A **Domain** is the *territory*; a **Bounded Context** is a *purpose‑made map* of that territory.

The concept of a `U.BoundedContext`, inspired by Domain-Driven Design (DDD) but elevated to a universal first principle, is essential for several reasons:

1.  **To Manage Complexity:** Real-world systems are too complex to be described by a single, monolithic model. A `U.BoundedContext` allows us to break down this complexity into manageable parts. Inside a context (e.g., "Air Traffic Control"), the term "flight" has a precise, unambiguous meaning. Outside, it could mean many things.
2.  **To Enable Pluralism:** Different teams, disciplines, or even historical eras have different models of reality. A `U.BoundedContext` allows these different worldviews to coexist without contradiction. As demonstrated in A.2, Pluto can be a `PlanetRole` in the context of `Early20thCenturyAstronomy` and a `DwarfPlanetRole` in the context of `IAU_2006_Definition`. The context is what resolves the apparent paradox.
3.  **To Make Roles Meaningful:** As established in A.2.1 `U.RoleAssignment`, a `U.Role` is only meaningful *inside* a context. The role of "Lead Engineer" is defined by the rules and expectations of "Project Phoenix," not by some universal law of engineering. The context provides the "stage" upon which the role is performed.

In short, a `U.BoundedContext` is not just a "scope" or a "namespace." It is a **holon of meaning**, a self-contained universe of discourse with its own local truth.

#### 3 · Core Components & Attributes

A `U.BoundedContext` is a composite holon defined by the following key components, which collectively constitute its model:

*   **`Glossary` (Local Lexicon):** A set of `U.Lexeme` entries (from Lang-CHR) that defines the specific vocabulary used within this context. It maps local terms to canonical FPF `U.Types` and clarifies any domain-specific jargon. This is where a context declares, "Inside here, the word 'ticket' means a `U.WorkItem`, not a `U.TravelPermit`."

*   **`Invariants` (Local Rules):** A set of machine- and human-readable rules (`U.ConstraintRule` from Norm-CAL) that must hold for any artifact or process within this context. This is the most powerful component, as it defines the "local physics" of the context.
    *   **Example Invariant (Role Compatibility):** *"Within this context, a `holder` cannot simultaneously play the `AuditorRole` and the `DeveloperRole`."*
    *   **Example Invariant (State Transition):** *"A `U.WorkItem` in this context can only transition from 'In Progress' to 'In Review', never directly to 'Done'."*

*   **`Roles` (Local Taxonomy):** A partial order of `U.Role`s that are defined and valid *only* within this context. It specifies the "job titles" available on this "stage."

*   **`Bridges` (Optional Mappings):** A set of explicit mappings (`U.Alignment`) to other `U.BoundedContext`s. A bridge defines how concepts and terms are translated when information flows from one context to another. This is the formal mechanism for inter-context communication.
    *   **Example Bridge:** A mapping that states, *"The `UserStory` concept in the `AgileDevelopment` context is functionally congruent (CL=1) to the `Requirement` concept in the `FormalEngineering` context."*

#### 4 · Relations to Other FPF Concepts

*   **As a `U.Holon`:** A `U.BoundedContext` is itself a holon. It has a **boundary** (the semantic line between what's inside and outside its model), **parts** (its `Glossary`, `Invariants`, etc.), and can be part of a larger whole (a context can be nested within another, more general context).

*   **As the Anchor for `U.RoleAssignment`:** The `context` field of a `U.RoleAssignment` **MUST** reference a valid `U.BoundedContext`. This ensures that every role assignment is explicitly anchored to a well-defined semantic frame.

*   **As the Scope for `U.Objective`:** A `U.Objective` (from Norm-CAL) is often defined relative to a context. The goal of "maximize velocity" is meaningful within the context of an `AgileSprint`, but might be meaningless or even counterproductive in a `ResearchDiscovery` context.

*   **As a Target for `U.Transformer`:** A `U.BoundedContext` can be changed. The evolution of a team's process, a scientific theory, or a project's rules is modeled as a `Transformer` acting on the `U.BoundedContext` holon itself (e.g., by adding a new invariant or deprecating a role).

#### 5 · Archetypal Grounding

The concept of a `U.BoundedContext` is universal and applies to both physical/operational domains and purely abstract/epistemic ones. Understanding these two archetypes clarifies its role as a fundamental FPF primitive.

| Archetype | Holder of the Context | `U.BoundedContext` Example | Core Components Illustrated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`U.System` Archetype** | A modern software engineering team | **`AgileProject:Phoenix`** | **`Glossary`**: Defines "Story Point," "Sprint," "Velocity." <br> **`Invariants`**: "Daily stand-up must not exceed 15 minutes." "A Story cannot move to 'Done' without a linked Test Case." <br> **`Roles`**: `ProductOwnerRole`, `ScrumMasterRole`, `DeveloperRole`. <br> **`Bridges`**: Maps `Velocity` metric to the `FinanceDept` context's `CostCenter:BudgetBurnRate`. |
| **`U.Episteme` Archetype** | A scientific community | **`Theory:SpecialRelativity`** | **`Glossary`**: Defines "Inertial Frame," "Lorentz Transformation," "Proper Time." <br> **`Invariants`**: "The speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers." "The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames." <br> **`Roles`**: `Postulate#AxiomaticCoreRole`, `Experiment#EvidenceRole`. <br> **`Bridges`**: Maps its concept of "Spacetime" to the `GeneralRelativity` context's more complex concept of "Curved Spacetime." |

**Key takeaway from grounding:**
This illustrates that a `U.BoundedContext` is not an abstract container but a **holon with tangible content**. For the engineering team, it's their project's "operating system." For the scientific theory, it's the "intellectual constitution." In both cases, the context defines what is true, what is possible, and what words mean *locally*.

#### 6 · Conformance Checklist

To ensure `U.BoundedContext` is used consistently and rigorously, the following normative checks apply.

| ID | Requirement (Normative Predicate) | Purpose / Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CC-A1.1.1 (Holon Nature)** | A `U.BoundedContext` **MUST** be modeled as a `U.Holon` with a defined `U.Boundary`. | Reinforces that contexts are well-defined entities, not vague groupings. Enables reasoning about contexts themselves as systems. |
| **CC-A1.1.2 (Role Localization)**| Every `U.Role` **MUST** be defined within the `Roles` taxonomy of at least one `U.BoundedContext`. A "global" role is forbidden. | Ensures that roles are never context-free. Prevents ambiguity by forcing every role to be anchored to a specific semantic frame. |
| **CC-A1.1.3 (Invariant Scope)** | An `Invariant` defined within a context **MUST** only apply to holons and processes operating *within* that context. | Prevents the leakage of local rules into the global space, which is critical for modularity and managing complexity. |
| **CC-A1.1.4 (Bridge Explicitness)** | Any interaction or mapping between two `U.BoundedContext`s **MUST** be modeled as an explicit `Bridge` artifact. | Forbids "backdoor" or implicit communication between contexts. Makes all inter-context dependencies visible and auditable. |
| **CC-A1.1.5 (RoleAssignment Context Anchor)** | Every `U.RoleAssignment` **MUST** reference exactly one `U.BoundedContext` in its `context` field. | Guarantees that every role assignment is unambiguous and its meaning is fully determined by a single, authoritative context. |

#### 7 · Consequences

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Enables True Modularity:** By encapsulating models, FPF can support large, complex systems where different teams can work on their own bounded contexts in parallel with minimal interference. | **Modeling Overhead:** Requires architects to explicitly think about and define the boundaries of their models, which can feel like extra work initially. *Mitigation:* This upfront effort is a strategic investment that prevents the much higher cost of integration chaos and semantic ambiguity later in the project. |
| **Resolves Ambiguity and Paradox:** Provides a formal mechanism to manage synonyms, homonyms, and conflicting models (like the Pluto example). It transforms "it depends" into a precise, queryable structure. | **Bridge Maintenance:** As contexts evolve, the bridges between them must be maintained. *Mitigation:* FPF tooling should support "link integrity" checks to automatically flag broken or outdated bridges. |
| **Makes Rules Explicit:** The `Invariants` component of a context makes the local rules and invariants for a project or theory explicit, documented, and auditable. | - |
| **Foundation for Scalable Autonomy:** In multi-agent systems, each agent can operate within its own bounded context, communicating with others through well-defined bridges. This is a prerequisite for building robust, decentralized systems. | - |

#### 8 · Rationale

**Lineage and fit with Domain‑Driven Design (DDD).**  
FPF generalizes the proven DDD idea of a **Bounded Context** from software into a universal modeling primitive:

| DDD concept | FPF counterpart | Generalization in FPF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bounded Context | **U.BoundedContext** (a holon) | Used for systems **and** knowledge; first‑class object with explicit Glossary, Invariants, local Roles, Bridges. |
| Ubiquitous Language | **Glossary** of the context | The shared vocabulary is an explicit component, not just narrative. |
| Context Map | **Bridges/Alignment** between contexts | Cross‑context relations are modeled explicitly rather than assumed globally. |

**Why this matters here.**  
`U.BoundedContext` gives `U.RoleAssignment` (A.2.1) its footing: role meanings are **local by design**, conflicts are checked **inside** the same context, and differences **across** contexts are handled by *explicit bridges** instead of “global truth.”

The introduction of `U.BoundedContext` as a first-class holon is a direct implementation of several core FPF principles and is strongly supported by contemporary practice.

*   **Philosophical Grounding:** The idea that meaning is always local and context-dependent is a cornerstone of late 20th-century philosophy of language (e.g., Wittgenstein's "language-games"). FPF operationalizes this insight.
*   **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** The concept is a direct borrowing and generalization from Eric Evans' seminal work on DDD, where the Bounded Context is the central strategic pattern for managing complexity in large-scale software. Its success over the past two decades in the software industry provides powerful empirical validation for its utility. FPF elevates it from a software design pattern to a universal ontological primitive.
*   **Architectural Necessity:** For FPF to fulfill its promise of being an "operating system for thought," it needs a mechanism analogous to an OS's "process separation." A `U.BoundedContext` is precisely that: a protected "memory space" for a model, preventing different models from corrupting each other.
*   **Enabler for Key Patterns:** The `Contextual Role Assignment` pattern (A.2.1) would be incoherent without a formal definition of "Context." This pattern provides that necessary foundation, making the entire role-based architecture sound.

In essence, `U.BoundedContext` is the architectural pattern that allows FPF to be both **universal** in its core principles and **specific** and **pluralistic** in its applications. It is the mechanism that tames complexity and makes large-scale, multi-paradigm modeling possible.

#### 9 · Relations

*   **Constitutes:** The foundational "semantic space" for patterns like `A.2 Role Taxonomy` and `A.13 The Agential Role`.
*   **Builds on:** `A.1 Holonic Foundation`, as a `U.BoundedContext` is itself a `U.Holon`.
*   **Interacts with:**
    *   `Norm-CAL`: A context's `Invariants` are typically expressed as `U.ConstraintRule`s.
    *   `Lang-CHR`: A context's `Glossary` is a collection of `U.Lexeme`s.
    *   `Decsn-CAL`: Decisions and objectives are often scoped to a specific context.
*   **Enables:** The resolution of conflicts as modeled in `D.3 Holonic Conflict Topology`, by showing that many conflicts are context-dependent.

## A.2 Role Taxonomy  \[A] 

*A holon’s essence tells us **what it is**; its roles tell us **what it is being, here and now**.*

### Context

Pattern A.1 established the **substantial** characteristic of the core (`Entity → Holon → {System, Episteme, …}`), cleanly separating identity from structure and aggregation. The present pattern introduces the **functional** characteristic: how a holon participates in purposes **within a bounded context** and for some interval. This extends the early sketch of A.2 and tightens its alignment with A.7 (Strict Distinction): roles are *not* parts and *not* behaviours; they are contextual **masks** that a holon wears while behaviours are handled by **Method**/**Work**. 

### Problem

Without an explicit role calculus:

1. **Type explosion & conflation.** Each new purpose breeds a new “subtype” (`PumpAsCoolingLoop`, `PumpAsFuelLoop`, …), violating parsimony and fusing substance with function.
2. **Agency opacity.** It becomes unclear whether *any* system may act as a transformer/agent, or only pre-declared special kinds.
3. **Epistemic blindness.** Knowledge artefacts (papers, proofs) cannot be given roles, blocking modelling of citation, evidence, or design-time justification.

### Forces

| Force                                | Tension                                                              |   |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | - |
| **Identity vs Function**             | A holon’s make‑up ↔ its transient, contextual purpose.               |   |
| **Static vs Dynamic classification** | Fixed type lattice ↔ late‑binding of new roles.                      |   |
| **Universality vs Familiarity**      | One mechanism for pumps **and** papers ↔ domain‑specific role names. |   |
| **Simplicity vs Expressiveness**     | Minimal primitives ↔ multi‑role, multi‑holder scenarios.             |   |

---

### Solution 

We elevate **Role** to a first‑class, *context‑indexed* concept and make the **binding** between a holon and a role explicit.

#### S‑level definitions (normative)

* **`U.Role`** — a **context-bound** capability/obligation schema that a holon **may bear (play)** for a time interval. A role has **no parts** and **no resource deltas** of its own. *(A7 guard)*
* **`U.RoleAssignment`** — a first-class object recording that a holon **bears (plays)** a role **in** a bounded context, optionally with authority, justification, and provenance:

```
U.RoleAssignment {
  holder        : U.Holon,
  role          : U.Role,
  context       : U.BoundedContext,
  timespan?     : Interval,
  justification?: U.Episteme,  // why (standard, SOP, evidence)
  provenance?   : U.Method     // how assignment/verification was done
}
```

Short form (readable): `Holon#Role:Context [@Interval]`.

> **Why a first‑class binding?** It keeps identity (holon), function (role), context (semantics), and time (run‑window) separate yet linked, preventing the substance/function conflation identified above. The early `playsRoleOf(Holon, Role, span)` relation in the draft is subsumed by `U.RoleAssignment` and extended with **Context** (and optional governance fields).

#### Temporal & behavioural alignment

* **Method** exists **only while** some **Work** is underway; **MethodDescription** persists as Episteme. A Role **binds** to Method (design‑time), and Work **performs** Method under that Role (run‑time). This preserves the *role ≠ behaviour* split and the *design ↔ run* duality.
* Only **Work** carries resource deltas (feeds Γ\_work); a Role never does.

---

### Invariants (must‑hold, concept‑level)

1. **Locality.** `role ∈ Roles(context)`. Outside its context, a role’s meaning is undefined.
2. **Non‑mereological.** No Role (nor Method/MethodDescription) may appear in any `partOf` chain; holarchies are for substantial holons only.
3. **Multiplicity.** A holder may **bear** multiple roles concurrently; a role may be **borne** by many holders—subject to each context’s compatibility rules.
4. **Time anchoring.** `timespan` (if present) is non‑empty and finite for run‑time claims; design‑time bindings are timeless but versioned via `MethodDescription` identity.
5. **Behavioural coherence.** During a Work interval, the performer **shall** play the Role that binds the executed Method. *(No hidden role swaps.)*

### Taxonomic frame (within a context)

Within each `U.BoundedContext`, role names are organised as a **partial order** (refinements) plus an **incompatibility** relation (mutually exclusive roles). Typical **substrate‑neutral** anchors:

| Kernel Role       | Intent                                | System archetype              | Episteme archetype                       |   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | - |
| `TransformerRole` | Changes other holons via Method/Work. | Robot arm assembling casings. | Prover constructing a new lemma.         |   |
| `ObserverRole`    | Collects evidence / metrics.          | Sensor array on a test‑rig.   | Reviewer annotating an article.          |   |
| `SupervisorRole`  | Governs subordinate holons.           | PLC orchestrating a line.     | Meta‑analysis curator combining studies. |   |

> Domains refine these anchors: e.g., `CoolingCirculatorRole`, `CitationSourceRole`, `LemmaRole`.

### Running examples (design ↔ run on one page)

**System case — Cooling loop**
`PumpUnit#3#HydraulicPump:Plant‑A`
`HydraulicPump ↦binds↦ ChannelFluid` (design)
`run‑2025‑08‑08 isExecutionOf centrifugal_pump_curve.ld` and `performedBy PumpUnit#3` (run)
*(All behavioural/resource facts live in Work; the Role is the mask.)*

**Episteme case — Standard in design**
`RFC‑9110.pdf#ProtocolStandard:WorldWideWeb` justifies `MethodDescription` selection; the **system** bearing `TransformerRole` is the design service that executed the selection work. The episteme did **not** act.

**Collective vs set (safety pitfall)**
A **set** `{Alice, Bob, 3.14}` has no behaviour; a **team** is a **system** with boundary, coordination **Method**, and supervision **Work**; only the latter can bear agentic roles.

---

### Anti‑patterns (with safe rewrites)

1. **“Transformer as system subtype.”**
   ✗ *“`U.TransformerSystem` builds pumps.”*
   ✓ *“`RobotArm R‑45#Transformer:Plant‑A` executed Work W.”* (Role is a mask; behaviour is Method/Work.)

2. **“Role as part.”**
   ✗ *“The pump’s role is one of its components.”*
   ✓ Roles are **never** parts; components are substantial. Keep all `partOf` chains role‑free.

3. **“Episteme acts by itself.”**
   ✗ *“The PDF enforced the SOP.”*
   ✓ An **episteme** can hold roles like `ProtocolStandard` **in context**, but only a **system** performs the Method/Work that uses it.

4. **“Context leakage.”**
   ✗ *“Pluto is Planet and DwarfPlanet.”* (in one tacit space)
   ✓ *“`Pluto#Planet:Early20thCenturyAstronomy`; `Pluto#DwarfPlanet:IAU_2006_Definition`.”* No contradiction—different bounded contexts. (Illustrative of `U.RoleAssignment` semantics carried forward from the A.2.1.)

### Authoring guidance (for engineers and leads)

* **Name roles for intent, not mechanics.** Prefer `CoolingCirculatorRole` over `ChannelFluidWithCentrifugalProfile`.
* **Pin the context early.** If two teams disagree, split contexts and (optionally) define an alignment bridge; do not over‑generalise the role.
* **Document the binding chain.** For any operational claim, be ready to point to: `RoleAssigning → Method ↔ MethodDescription → Work`. (Readers’ dictionary: *BPMN workflow → MethodDescription; operation/job → Work.*)

### Consequences

| Benefit                     | Why it matters                                                                                                       | Trade‑off / Mitigation                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Category‑error immunity** | Clear firewall between **identity** (holarchies) and **function** (roles) prevents mixing “parts” with “masks”.      | Slight modelling overhead; templates provide checklists (A.7, A.14).                         |
| **Operational clarity**     | Who does what, when, and under which mask becomes audit‑ready (`performedBy ⊆ playsRoleOf`).                         | Requires spans on Role assignments; mitigated by default “open‑ended” spans in drafts.          |
| **Epistemic hygiene**       | Knowledge holons contribute as **evidence** or **constraints**, never as doers.                                      | Authors must rewrite anthropomorphic prose; canonical rewrites help.                         |
| **Cross‑context pluralism** | Same bearer can hold different roles across contexts without contradiction; differences are explicit in the binding. | Requires declaring the **bounded context**; E.10 eases the ceremony with registers/aliases.  |
| **Γ‑coherence**             | Order/time/aggregation stay in Γ‑operators, not overloaded into “role" edges.                                        | Authors learn when to call Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time; the Part B on‑ramp is short.                      |

### Rationale (post‑2015 cross‑domain corroboration)

*Why insist on roles as contextual masks and externalised transformers?*

1. **Constructor Theory (2015–2022).** Post‑2015 work by Deutsch & Marletto re‑centres physics on **possible tasks and constructors** rather than objects, mirroring FPF’s **TransformerRole**: behaviour is attached to “who can realise a task,” not to substance per se. Our separation of **SubstantialHolon** vs **Role** and the insistence on **external** transformers directly echo this shift. *(Conceptual alignment noted in A.2 Solution and A.12 intent.)* 
2. **Layered Control Architectures (Matni–Ames–Doyle, 2024).** The modern control stack cleanly **externalises** regulators and planners relative to plants. FPF’s obligatory “system bearing TransformerRole” (A.7, A.12) is isomorphic to that separation, keeping supervision and actuation **outside** the controlled holon. 
3. **Active‑Inference / Agency spectrum (2017–2023).** Contemporary models treat agency as **graded** and **contextual** (percept‑act loops tuned by free‑energy bounds). A.13 adopts exactly this: **AgentialRole** is a role worn by a holon, with graded measurements via **Agency‑CHR**, not a static type.
4. **Basal Cognition & multi‑scale organisation (2019–2024).** Fields & Levin argue for **cross‑scale** control and information flows; FPF encodes this via Γ‑flavours and the **Meta‑Holon Transition** triggers, ensuring Role assignments compose across scales without collapsing identity into function.
5. **Knowledge ecosystems & safety cases (2018–2025).** Modern assurance relies on **traceable evidence** and conservative integration (no “truth averaging”): our A.10 anchors (SCR/RSCR) and Γ\_epist’s **weakest‑link** fold implement that discipline and forbid self‑evidence. 

> Summing up: post‑2015 science and engineering converge on **roles as contextual capabilities**, **externalised control**, and **traceable evidence**. A.2 codifies these insights in a substrate‑neutral way, keeping the Core small yet powerful.

### Relations

* **Builds on:**
  **A.1 Holonic Foundation** (role/mereology split), **A.7 Strict Distinction** (role ≠ behaviour; episteme ≠ carrier), **A.14 Advanced Mereology** (no roles in holarchies).  
* **Specialises / Coordinates with:**
  **A.13 Agential Role & Agency Spectrum** (behavioural roles over systems; graded agency), **A.15 Role–Method–Work Alignment** (bindsMethod / isExecutionOf discipline). 
* **Constrains / Used by B‑cluster:**
  **B.1 Universal Algebra of Aggregation (Γ)** (keep order/time in Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time; keep provenance in Γ\_epist), **B.2 Meta‑Holon Transition** (promotion when supervision/closure appears), **B.3 Trust & Assurance** (evidence & congruence).  
* **Interlocks with E‑cluster (governance & language):**
  **E.10 Lexical Discipline** (registers, tier disambiguation, local aliases like “Transformer”), **E.5.1 DevOps Lexical Firewall** (ban tooling tokens in Core patterns). 
* **Reinforces:**

## 1 · Intent & scope (what this pattern fixes)

**Intent.** Provide one, universal, **context‑local** way to say *who is being what, where (and when)* without altering what the thing **is**. The same grammar works for people, machines, software, teams, and **also** for knowledge artefacts (epistemes) when they hold **statuses** rather than perform actions.

**Scope.**

* Defines **`U.RoleAssignment`** (binding a **holder** holon to a **role** inside a **bounded context**, optionally within a **time window**).
* Separates that binding from **`U.RoleEnactment`** (the *run‑time* fact that a piece of **Work** was performed under that assignment).
* Names the **Role Characterisation Space (RCS)** and the **Role State Graph (RSG)** as **intensional** facets of a Role (recorded in its `RoleDescription`, upgraded to `RoleSpec` only after tests exist).
* Declares **eligibility** constraints so Roles apply to the right holon kinds, **without chains** like “Transformer is assigned to be Agent”. Role families are independent.

**Non‑goals.** No storage models, no workflows, no org charts. This is a **thinking contract**; all semantics are notation‑free.

---

## 2 · Problem frame (recurring confusions this removes)

1. **Type explosion.** Baking transient function into rigid types (“CoolingPump”, “AuditDeveloper”) violates parsimony and makes change brittle.
2. **Context drift.** Labels like *Operator*, *Process Owner*, *Standard* slide in meaning across teams/years when not tied to a **Context**.
3. **Actor vagueness.** Work logs state that things happened but not **who, in what capacity**, under which **local rules**.
4. **Category leaks.** Documents “do” tasks; deontic statuses are treated like run‑time states; capabilities are confused with permissions.
5. **Role chains.** Attempting “System ↦ TransformerRole ↦ AgentRole” mixes **independent** role families and hides design intent.

## 3 · Forces (and how we resolve them)

| Force                            | Resolution in this pattern                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs locality**     | One mechanism (`U.RoleAssignment`), but every meaning is **context‑local** (Context); Cross‑context sameness only via **Bridge** (F.9). |
| **Stability vs change**          | **Identity of holder** stable; **assignments** come/go via windows; **enactments** are punctual facts attached to Work.           |
| **Clarity vs brevity**           | Full definition + the mnemonic shorthand `Holder#Role:Context@Window`.                                                            |
| **Behavior vs status**           | **Only systems enact behavior**; epistemes **hold statuses**. Different role families, no chains.                                 |
| **Specification vs description** | Role **RCS/RSG** are recorded in **RoleDescription**; upgrade to **RoleSpec** only after a test harness exists (E.10.D2).         |

## 4 · Solution — the binding and its strict neighbours

### 4.1 Canonical definition (notation‑free)

**`U.RoleAssignment`** is a **context‑local** binding:

```
RoleAssignment ::= 〈holder: U.Holon, role: U.Role, context: U.BoundedContext, window?: U.Window〉
```

**Invariants (normative).**

* **RA‑1 (Locality).** `role` **MUST** be defined in `context` (its meaning is exactly the one recorded in that Context’s RoleDescription/RoleSpec).
* **RA‑2 (No role‑of‑role).** `holder` **MUST** be a `U.Holon` (System, Episteme, or composite). Assigning roles **to roles** is forbidden.
* **RA‑3 (Eligibility by role family).**

  * **Behavioural / Agential / Constructor roles**: `holder` **MUST** be a `U.System`. Only systems can enact Methods and produce Work.
  * **Epistemic‑status / Normative‑status roles** (e.g., *Evidence*, *Standard*, *Requirement*): `holder` **MUST** be a `U.Episteme`.
  * **Service‑governance roles** (e.g., *ServiceOffering*, *SLO‑Clause* as status carriers): holder is typically a `U.Episteme`; execution still requires a System in a behavioural role.
    *(Contexts may refine eligibility, but cannot weaken these families.)*
* **RA‑4 (Window discipline).** If `window` is present, enactments (below) **MUST** occur within it; if absent, interpret as “open‑ended from assignment time”.
* **RA‑5 (Separation).** A RoleAssignment confers **the capacity/authorization to act** (or the status to be recognised), but it is **not behaviour** (no Work implied), **not capability** (intrinsic ability lives elsewhere), and **not structure** (may never appear in a BoM).
 
  Never use "appointment" as a synonym to "assignment".

**Didactic read.** Think **badge** (*who wears which mask, where, when*). The rules for the mask live **in the room** (Context).

**Two assignment modes**
A RoleAssignment can be:
(a) Authoritative — issued by an authority or policy in the Context (often via a SpeechAct Work); it can open the Green‑Gate for steps that require explicit authorization.
(b) Observational — an evidence‑backed classification that the holder occupies a Role in this Context (e.g., “Moon as SatelliteRole:IAU_2006”). Observational assignments never by themselves open operational Green‑Gates; they can gate decisions and analysis.

### 4.2 Role Enactment (distinct from the assignment)

**`U.RoleEnactment`** captures the *run‑time* fact that **a specific piece of Work** was performed under **a specific Role Assignment**:

```
RoleEnactment ::= 〈work: U.Work, by: U.RoleAssignment〉
```

**Invariants.**

* **RE‑1 (Actor reality).** `by.holder` **MUST** be a `U.System`. (Epistemes never enact Work.)
* **RE‑2 (Temporal fit).** `work.window` **MUST** overlap `by.window` (or `by.window` is open and contains `work.window`).
* **RE‑3 (Method gate).** For the `MethodStep` realised by `work`, `by.role` **MUST** satisfy the step’s `requiredRoles` in that **same Context** (directly or via `≤` specialization inside the Context).
* **RE‑4 (Traceability).** Every `U.Work` **MUST** reference exactly one `U.RoleEnactment` (hence a determinate RoleAssignment) as its performer.

*Reading:* **Assignments authorize; enactments happen.** That single sentence prevents months of muddled logs.

Role Enactment is the occurrence of `U.Work` performed by a `holder` while a valid `U.RoleAssignment` for the required Role is in an enactable state of its RoleStateGraph (A.2.5) within the same Context. Enactment is generic: it includes operational work (e.g., actuation) and communicative work (speech acts such as approvals).

### 4.3 Role Characterisation Space (RCS) & Role State Graph (RSG)

These are **intensional facets** of a **Role**, not containers “inside” the Role. They are **recorded in** the **RoleDescription** (or **RoleSpec** once harnessed), per E.10.D2.

* **RCS (Role Characterisation Space).** A set of named characteristics that parameterise how the Role is understood in a Context (e.g., *AgencyLevel ∈ {None, Assisted, Delegated, Autonomous}*; *SafetyCriticality ∈ {SC0…SC3}*).
* **RSG (Role State Graph).** A directed graph of **named states** (nodes) and **admissible transitions** (edges) for the Role **within the Context** (e.g., *{Eligible → Authorized → Active → Suspended → Revoked}*).

  * Each **state** has a **Conformance Checklist** (set of observable cues) supporting **Evaluations** (“X ∈ *Authorized*@context in W”).
  * RSG governs **role state transitions**, independent of any Work instance.

**Discipline.** Say *“Role is **characterised by** RCS/RSG recorded in RoleDescription”*, **never** “Role **contains** its states.”

---

### 4.4 Shorthand & reading

Use the canonical compact form in prose and diagrams:

```
Holder#Role:Context@Window
```

Examples:

* `PLC_17#Transformer:PipelineOps@2025‑04‑01..2025‑06‑30`
* `ISO_26262v2018#NormativeStandard:AutoSafetyCase` *(status role on an Episteme; no enactment)*

*The shorthand is didactic; the semantics are those of §§4.1–4.3.*

---

### 4.5 Independence of role families (no chains)

Role families (e.g., **Agential**, **Constructor/Transformer**, **Observer/Measurer**, **Status**) are **independent**. A Context may state that *`Surgeon ≤ Clinician`* **within the same family**, but **MUST NOT** model “Transformer is an Agent” by chaining RoleAssignments. When a holder must satisfy **both** an Agential and a Transformer requirement, the **MethodStep** **requires both** roles; the holder **wears two badges**, not a badge‑of‑a‑badge.

## 5 · Eligibility across holon kinds (normative matrix)

A Role’s **family** constrains **who can wear its badge**. Eligibility is part of **didactic hygiene** and prevents chains like “Transformer → Agent”.

### 5.1 Holder kinds (recap)

* **`U.System`** — any acting holon (person, device, software service, team, organization, socio‑technical unit).
* **`U.Episteme`** — any knowledge unit (document, dataset, model, standard, contract).
* **`U.Holon`** — supertype; only **Systems** enact Work; **Epistemes** can only hold **status** roles.

### 5.2 Role‑family × holder matrix

| Role family (examples)                                                 | May be held by `U.System` | May be held by `U.Episteme` | Notes (eligibility refinements live in Context)                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------------------: | :-------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Agential** (e.g., *Agent*, *Decision‑Maker*, *Approver*)             |           **✓**           |              ✗              | Requires RCS characteristic *AgencyLevel*; RSG must expose *Authorized/Active* states.                                                   |
| **Transformer/Constructor** (e.g., *Welder*, *ETL‑Runner*)             |           **✓**           |              ✗              | Performs Methods; produces Work; often requires *Capability* evidence.                                                         |
| **Observer/Measurer** (e.g., *Observer*, *Monitor*)                    |           **✓**           |              ✗              | Produces `U.Observation`; may be passive (probe) or active (test rig).                                                         |
| **Communicator/Speech** (e.g., *Authorizer*, *Notifier*)               |           **✓**           |              ✗              | A subtype of behavioral roles; produces `U.Work` typed as SpeechAct.                                                           |
| **Service‑Governance** (e.g., *ServiceOffering*, *SLO‑ClauseCarrier*)  |           (rare)          |            **✓**            | Usually **Episteme** (catalog entry, policy). If a System “offers”, the *offer* is a SpeechAct; the *offering* is an Episteme. |
| **Epistemic‑Status** (e.g., *Evidence*, *Definition*, *AxiomaticCore*) |             ✗             |            **✓**            | Status roles for knowledge; never enact Work.                                                                                  |
| **Normative‑Status / Deontic** (e.g., *Requirement*, *Standard*)       |             ✗             |            **✓**            | Source of obligations; Work is checked **against** them, not enacted by them.                                                  |

**Invariant — RA‑3 (eligibility)** *(restated)*: Assignments **MUST** respect this matrix. A Context may **tighten** (e.g., “Approver must be human”), never loosen.

**Conformance checks (easy to remember).**

* **CC‑ELIG‑1.** If `role.family ∈ {Agential, Transformer, Observer, Speech}`, then `holder : U.System`.
* **CC‑ELIG‑2.** If `role.family ∈ {Epistemic‑Status, Normative‑Status, Service‑Governance}`, then `holder : U.Episteme`.
* **CC‑ELIG‑3.** No “role of a role”: `role` is bound to a **holder**, not to another role or assignment.

---

## 6 · Role algebra **within a single Context** (meaning relations)

Role algebra relates **role types** inside **one** `U.BoundedContext`. It is **not** mereology.

### 6.1 Specialization (narrower assignment)

* **Notation:** `RoleS ≤ RoleG`
* **Semantics (normative):** For any `U.RoleAssignment` with `role = RoleS` in this Context, the holder **also satisfies** requirements for `RoleG` in this Context.
* **Use:** Stable expertise ladders, privilege inheritance.
* **CC‑ALG‑1.** Engines that check `requiredRoles` **MUST** treat `≤` as admissible substitution.

### 6.2 Incompatibility (conceptual role incompatibility)

* **Notation:** `RoleA ⊥ RoleB`
* **Semantics (normative):** A single holder **MUST NOT** have overlapping `window`s for assignments to both roles in this Context.
* * **CC‑ALG‑2.** Validation **MUST** reject overlapping assignments that violate `⊥`.

### 6.3 Bundles (conjunctive requirement)

* **Notation:** `RoleC := Role1 ⊗ Role2 ⊗ …`
* **Semantics:** `RoleC` is **satisfied iff** the holder has **simultaneous** valid assignments for each conjunct role (in this Context).
* **Use:** “On‑call Incident Commander” = *Engineer ⊗ Communicator ⊗ Decision‑Maker*.
* **CC‑ALG‑3.** Checking `requires: [RoleC]` **MUST** expand to conjunctive checks.

> **Didactic guardrails.**
> Use `≤` for lasting ladders, `⊥` for critical safety/governance, `⊗` for frequent conjunctions. Prefer listing multiple `requiredRoles` on Method steps to avoid ornate lattices.

---

## 7 · Time & state transition calculus (windows, RSG, enactability)

**Assignments authorize**, **enactments happen** — in time. RSG governs the **role’s** state transitions; `window` governs the **binding’s** validity.

### 7.1 Windows and overlap

* **Window form:** `@t_start..t_end` (ends may be open).
* **RE‑2 (temporal fit)** *(restated)*: `work.window` **MUST** lie within (or overlap appropriately with) `assignment.window`.
* **Handover pattern:** Close `A#Role@..t` and open `B#Role@t..` — never delete history.
* **CC‑WIN‑1.** Historic assignments **MUST NOT** be erased; close the window instead.

### 7.2 RSG gating of enactment

Each Role’s **RoleDescription/RoleSpec** defines an **RSG** with named states. Some states are **enactable**.

* **RSG‑1 (state types).** A state **MUST** declare whether it **permits** enactment (*enactable: true/false*).
* **RSG‑2 (checklists).** Each state **MUST** list a **Conformance Checklist** (E.10.D2) — observable cues to support **U.Evaluation** yielding a **StateAssertion**.
* **RE‑5 (RSG gate).** A `U.RoleEnactment` is valid **iff** at enactment time the `U.RoleAssignment` can be supported by a **valid StateAssertion** that the holder is in an **enactable** state of the Role’s RSG **in this Context**.
* **Example.** *SurgeonRole* states: *Eligible → Authorized → Active → Suspended → Revoked*. Only **Active** is enactable. A pre‑op checklist produces `StateAssertion(SurgeonRole, Active)`.

**Practical reading.** *Badge valid* (window) ∧ *state is right* (RSG) ⇒ you may act.

### 7.3 Suspensions, revocations, probation

* **Suspend:** transition to a **non‑enactable** state (e.g., *Suspended*). Keep the assignment’s window open; enactment is blocked by **RE‑5**.
* **Revoke:** either (a) close the window, or (b) transition to *Revoked* (non‑enactable).
* **Probation:** a dedicated RSG state with limited enactability (e.g., only under supervision, modelled as an extra required role on Method steps).
* **CC‑RSG‑1.** RSG transitions **MUST** be explicit; no implicit “back to Active”.

### 7.4 Typical temporal patterns (didactic)

* **Shift rotation.** `A#Role@08:00..16:00`, `B#Role@16:00..24:00` — clean handover, no `⊥` issues.
* **Shadowing.** `Trainee#Role@..` + `Mentor#SupervisorRole@..`; Method steps require **both** roles.
* **Emergency bundle.** `SoloOperator := Incision ⊗ Hemostasis ⊗ Suturing`; activate only under declared emergency (Context‑level policy).

## 8 · Anti‑patterns (and the fast fix)

| #      | Anti‑pattern          | Symptom                                    | Why it’s harmful                   | FPF fix (conceptual move)                                         |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A1** | **Global role label** | “Alice is Lead Engineer” (nowhere)         | Meaning drifts; untestable         | **Always anchor to Context**: `Alice#LeadEngineer:ProjectPhoenix` |
| **A2** | **Role as part**      | BoM lists “Cooling Function”               | Category error (structure vs role) | Keep BoM structural; model `Pump#Cooling:ThermalMgmt`             |
| **A3** | **Document acts**     | “The SOP closed the ticket”                | Epistemes don’t enact Work         | Give the doc a **status role**; make a System enact the step      |
| **A4** | **Role chains**       | “Transformer assigned to be Agent”         | Collapses independent families     | Require **both roles** on Method step; one holder, two badges     |
| **A5** | **Hidden state**      | Acting while *Authorized? Active?* unclear | Safety & audit gaps                | Use RSG with **StateAssertions** gating enactment                 |
| **A6** | **Edition blur**      | Context “ITIL” with no version             | Sense slippage                     | Context card must carry **edition** (E.10.D1/F.1)                  |
| **A7** | **Bridge‑by‑name**    | Equating roles across Contexts by label       | Cross‑context drift                   | Use **F.9 Bridge** with CL & loss notes                           |

## 9 · Archetypal grounding (three disparate arenas)

**Goal.** Show that the same binding **`Holder#Role:Context@Window`**, plus **RCS** (Role‑Characterisation Space) and **RSG** (Role‑State Graph), works uniformly for **operational systems**, **software/service operations**, and **knowledge governance**.

Natural systems note. Spontaneous physical phenomena (e.g., Moon orbiting Earth) are modeled as `U.Dynamics`, not as `U.Work`. An observational RoleAssignment like `Moon#SatelliteRole:IAU_2006` is valid classification but does not imply enactment of a method.

### 9.1 Industrial operations (welding cell)

**Role (family).** `WelderRole` *(Transformer)*
\**RCS (illustrative characteristics).*

* `ProcessClass ∈ {MIG, TIG, Spot}`
* `QualifiedMaterial ∈ {Al, SS, Ti, …}`
* `MaxCurrentAmp ∈ ℝ⁺`
* `SafetyProfile ∈ {Standard, HotWork, ConfinedSpace}`

\**RSG (named states).*
`Unqualified → Qualified → Authorized → Active → Suspended → Revoked`
(*enactable*: **Active** only)

**Assignments.**

* `Robot_SN789#WelderRole:AssemblyLine_2025@2025‑02‑01..open`
* `Robot_SN790#WelderRole:AssemblyLine_2025@2025‑02‑01..open`

**StateAssertions (via checklists).**

* `StateAssertion(WelderRole, Qualified, AssemblyLine_2025, @2025‑02‑01..2026‑02‑01)` — training & test weld coupons.
* `StateAssertion(WelderRole, Active, AssemblyLine_2025, @2025‑03‑01..open)` — daily pre‑shift checks + gas/torch inspection.

**Enactment (gated by RSG).**
A `U.Work` entry `W#Seam134` is valid only if `performedBy = Robot_SN789#WelderRole:AssemblyLine_2025` and an **Active** `StateAssertion` covers the timestamp. If the torch‑health checklist fails, RSG transitions `Active → Suspended`; further seams are blocked by **RE‑5**.

---

### 9.2 Software & cloud operations (continuous delivery / SRE)

**Roles (families).**

* `DeployerRole` *(Transformer)* — authorises execution of deployment Methods.
* `IncidentCommanderRole` *(Agential/Speech)* — directs response and issues SpeechActs (declares incident states).

**RCS (illustrative).**

* `DeployerRole`: `Env ∈ {staging, prod}`, `ChangeWindow`, `RollbackAuthority ∈ {self, peer, CAB}`.
* `IncidentCommanderRole`: `OnCallTier ∈ {L1,L2,L3}`, `ServiceScope`, `PageDuty ∈ {primary, secondary}`.

\**RSGs (named states).*

* `DeployerRole`: `Eligible → Authorized → Active → Suspended` (*enactable*: **Active**).
* `IncidentCommanderRole`: `OnCall → Engaged → Handover → Rest` (*enactable*: **Engaged**).

**Assignments.**

* `sCG‑Spec_ci_bot#DeployerRole:CD_Pipeline_v7@2025‑04‑01..open`
* `Alex#IncidentCommanderRole:SRE_Prod@2025‑04‑10T08:00..2025‑04‑10T20:00`

**StateAssertions (via checklists).**

* `DeployerRole/Active`: completed change ticket, green pre‑deploy tests, peer‑review check mark.
* `IncidentCommanderRole/Engaged`: accepted page, situational brief read, comms‑channel opened.

**Enactment.**

* A deployment `Work` is valid only with `performedBy: sCG‑Spec_ci_bot#DeployerRole:CD_Pipeline_v7` **and** `Active` state asserted for the moment of start.
* Declaring `Incident SEV‑1` is a **SpeechAct Work** performed by `Alex#IncidentCommanderRole:SRE_Prod` in **Engaged** state; it changes deontic conditions (e.g., elevates `RollbackAuthority`).

---

### 9.3 Knowledge governance (standards & requirements)

**Roles (families).**

* `NormativeStandardRole` *(Normative‑Status Episteme)* — a document that is *the* standard **in this Context**.
* `RequirementRole` *(Deontic‑Status Episteme)* — a statement that **binds** behaviour in this Context.

**RCS (illustrative).**

* `NormativeStandardRole`: `Scope`, `Edition`, `ApplicabilityWindow`.
* `RequirementRole`: `BindingClass ∈ {shall, should, may}`, `TargetRole`, `AcceptanceClauseRef`.

\**RSGs (named states).*

* `NormativeStandardRole`: `Proposed → Adopted → Effective → Superseded` (*enactable*: N/A — Episteme roles are **non‑enactable**; they gate others).
* `RequirementRole`: `Draft → Approved → Effective → Retired` (non‑enactable).

**Assignments.**

* `ISO_26262_ed2.pdf#NormativeStandardRole:AutoSafetyCase_2025@2025‑01‑01..open`
* `REQ‑BRAKE‑001.md#RequirementRole:AutoSafetyCase_2025@2025‑03‑05..open`

**Effects (gating, not acting).**

* A system’s **Work** (e.g., HIL test run) is **evaluated** against clauses referenced by `RequirementRole`.
* An **Approval SpeechAct** (by a CAB chair who is a `U.System`) may transition `RequirementRole: Draft → Approved`. The Episteme does not “act”; **Systems** act, **Epistemes** hold status.

---

## 10 · Everyday pattern snippets (didactic moves)

> **Use these micro‑moves to think and speak cleanly; no tooling required.**

1. **“Who can do this step?”**
   On a `MethodStep`, write `requires: [RoleX]`. In your head, expand: “Any `performedBy` whose `role ≤ RoleX`, with a **valid window** and **enactable RSG state**.”
   *Example:* `requires: [SurgeonRole]` and `IncisionOperatorRole ≤ SurgeonRole` ⇒ `Dr.Kim#IncisionOperatorRole:Hospital.OR_2025` is admissible **iff** Active.

2. **Handover without history loss.**
   Close one window, open another. Never delete.
   `Alex#IncidentCommander:SRE_Prod@08:00..12:00`
   `Riya#IncidentCommander:SRE_Prod@12:00..20:00`

3. **Independence by construction (SoD).**
   Declare `Developer ⊥ IndependentAuditor`. Then it’s **impossible** (by validation) to have overlapping windows on one holder for both roles.

4. **Supervision as bundle.**
   Model apprenticeship by requiring `Trainee ⊗ Supervisor` on sensitive steps, or by RSG state **Probation** that flips `enactable` only if `SupervisorRole` is also present.

5. **Same badge name in two Contexts.**
   `LeadEngineer:ProjectPhoenix` ≠ `LeadEngineer:DivisionR&D`. If you must relate, create a **Bridge** with CL & loss notes; never rely on the name.

6. **Documents don’t act; they frame.**
   Replace “the SOP executed X” with: `SOP_v4#RequirementRole:SafetyCase` and a `SpeechAct` “approve run” by `QA_Officer#AuthorizerRole:Plant_2025`.

7. **Window + state ⇒ permission.**
   Quick mental check: *badge valid?* (window) ∧ *state OK?* (RSG) ⇒ **go**; else **no‑go**.

8. **Communicative enactment (approval)**
`CAB_Chair#ApproverRole:ChangeControl@2026-05-01T10:05` performs a SpeechAct Work “Approve Change-4711”. Effect: moves ApproverRole’s RSG state from Authorized?→Approved and
+   opens the Green‑Gate for the operational step “Deploy Change-4711” (performed by a different RoleAssignment).

## 11 · Conformance checklist (SCR) — compact, memorable

> **Pass these and your RoleAssignments are sound.**

**Anchoring & locality**

1. **CC‑CTX‑1.** Every `role` reference names a **role defined in the same `U.BoundedContext`** as the assignment.
2. **CC‑CTX‑2.** No cross‑Context equivalence is assumed by label; relations across Contexts live only in **Bridges** (F.9).

**Eligibility & families**
3\. **CC‑ELIG‑1.** Behavioral roles (`Agential/Transformer/Observer/Speech`) **MUST** bind **`U.System`** holders.
4\. **CC‑ELIG‑2.** Status roles (`Epistemic‑Status/Normative/Service‑Governance`) **MUST** bind **`U.Episteme`** holders.

**Role algebra (in‑Context)**
5\. **CC‑ALG‑1.** `≤` permits substitution for `requiredRoles`.
6\. **CC‑ALG‑2.** `⊥` forbids overlapping windows on the same holder.
7\. **CC‑ALG‑3.** `⊗` expands to conjunctive checks at performance time.

**Time & gating**
8\. **CC‑WIN‑1.** Historic RoleAssignments are never deleted; windows are **closed**, not erased.
9\. **CC‑ENACT‑1.** Every `U.Work` has `performedBy = some U.RoleAssignment`.
10\. **CC‑ENACT‑2.** At the `U.Work` timestamp, an **enactable** `RSG` state is asserted for that assignment (via **StateAssertion**).
11\. **CC‑ENACT‑3.** If state flips to non‑enactable (e.g., **Suspended**), enactment is blocked until an **Active** assertion reappears.

**Strict distinction & category hygiene**
12\. **CC‑SD‑1.** No Role in a BoM/structure tree; roles do not participate in mereology.
13\. **CC‑SD‑2.** Epistemes never enact Work; only Systems do.

**Traceability**
14\. **CC‑TRC‑1.** From any `U.Work`, reviewers can trace **performedBy → RoleAssignment → Role → (RCS,RSG) → Context** and retrieve supporting **StateAssertion** evidence.

---

## 12 · Regression harness (RSCR) — what to re‑check when things change

> **Run these mental “diff checks” whenever you change roles, contexts, or states.**

**RSG & gating**

* **RSCR‑RSG‑E01.** After editing an RSG, verify that each enactable state still has a live **Conformance Checklist** and that historic **StateAssertions** remain interpretable (no silent renames).
* **RSCR‑RSG‑E02.** If a state flips *enactable⇄non‑enactable*, re‑evaluate pending or recurring `U.Work` plans (no hidden authorisations).

**SoD & windows**

* **RSCR‑SOD‑E01.** On adding `⊥` constraints, scan for overlapping assignments that newly violate SoD; schedule revocations or rescheduling.
* **RSCR‑SOD‑E02.** On removing `⊥`, confirm that governance rationale is recorded elsewhere (policy change Episteme).

**Context churn**

* **RSCR‑CTX‑E01.** When a Context edition updates, freeze prior RoleAssignments; create **new** assignments in the new Context rather than mutating old ones.
* **RSCR‑CTX‑E02.** Bridges referencing affected roles are reviewed for CL/loss adjustments.

**Eligibility drift**

* **RSCR‑ELIG‑E01.** If a role family changes (e.g., reclassifying *Offerer* from behavioral to status), audit all assignments for holder‑type violations.

**Trace continuity**

* **RSCR‑TRC‑E01.** Spot‑check that `U.Work → RoleAssignment → StateAssertion` chains still resolve after refactors.
* **RSCR‑TRC‑E02.** Randomly sample old incidents/runs to ensure reproducible authorisation verdicts.

**Name stability**

* **RSCR‑NAME‑E01.** If a role label changes, maintain the **role identity**; treat renamed labels as aliases inside the same Context rather than minting a new role unless RCS/RSG changed materially.

## 13 · Integration with A.15 — Role–Method–Work alignment

> **One line.** A `U.MethodDescription` **names** the roles it needs; a `U.Work` **cites** the concrete `U.RoleAssignment` that enacted the step; the **RSG state + window** gates that enactment.

### 13.1 Design‑time contract (inside `U.MethodDescription`)

For every **MethodStep**:

* **`requiredRoles`** — a list of `U.Role` **from the same Context as the step**.
  *Example.* In `Hospital.OR_2025`, step “Make incision” has `requires: [IncisionOperatorRole]`.
* **Role algebra in‑Context** applies: if the Context defines `IncisionOperatorRole ≤ SurgeonRole`, then `requires: [SurgeonRole]` also admits holders of `IncisionOperatorRole`.
* **Separation of concerns.** Capability checks (does the holder *can*?) belong to `U.Capability` and resource limits; **authorization** belongs to `U.RoleAssignment` + RSG.

### 13.2 Run‑time check (inside `U.Work`)

A `U.Work` record must carry:

* **`performedBy` =** a concrete **`U.RoleAssignment`** (not just a person/system name).
* **Window gate.** The Work timestamp falls inside the assignment’s `@Window`.
* **State gate.** At that timestamp, an **enactable** state for the assignment is proven by a **`StateAssertion`** (the checklist verdict for a named RSG state).
* **Role algebra gate.** The assignment’s `role` is either one of `requiredRoles` or a **specialization (`≤`)** thereof; bundles (`⊗`) expand to conjunctions; incompatibilities (`⊥`) forbid overlaps on the same holder.

### 13.3 Evaluation & acceptance (link to services & deontics)

* **Observation.** The Work produces `U.Observation`(s).
* **Evaluation.** A `U.Evaluation` compares Observations with **AcceptanceClause**(s) referenced by a **Service** or a **RequirementRole**.
* **SoD hook.** If the step or evaluation demands independence (e.g., “not performed by its reviewer”), enforce via `⊥` between `PerformerRole` and `ReviewerRole` **in the same Context**.

### 13.4 Planning & scheduling (design‑time “who will enact”)

* **`U.WorkDescription`** (renamed from “WorkPlan”) binds forthcoming steps to **candidate RoleAssignments** and time windows.
* **Checks before the fact.** Validate windows (no gaps/overlaps where disallowed), enforce `⊥`, ensure expected RSG state will be **enactable** at scheduled time (or flag a pre‑flight checklist).

> **Didactic cue.** Think **“Step asks for badges; Run cites a badge; Badge must be valid & green.”**
> (Badge = RoleAssignment; valid = window; green = RSG state with a fresh StateAssertion.)

---

## 14 · Cross‑Context bridges in practice (with CL penalties)

> **Rule.** **No Cross‑context substitution by name.** If a step in **Context A** needs `Role_A`, and the performer only holds `Role_B` in **Context B**, you must use an explicit **Bridge** (F.9) that says how `Role_B@B` relates to `Role_A@A`, with a **Congruence Level (CL)** and **loss notes**.

### 14.1 Directional substitution

A Bridge may assert, *directionally*:

* **`substitutesFor(Role_B@B → Role_A@A)`** with a CL and a list of **kept** and **lost** RCS characteristics / RSG nuances.
* The reverse direction **does not** follow unless declared.

### 14.2 CL → gating policy (normative thresholds)

| **CL** | Meaning (intuitive)                     | **Permit** | **Guard**                                                                            | **Block** |
| :----: | --------------------------------------- | :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------: |
|  **3** | Near‑isomorphic sense; no material loss |     Yes    | None beyond ordinary RSG/Window gates                                                |     —     |
|  **2** | Close but with stated losses            |     Yes    | Require **extra evidence** (e.g., additional checklist item) **or** a named reviewer |     —     |
|  **1** | Distant analogy; risky                  |  Exception | Only by explicit **Waiver SpeechAct** naming the Bridge + loss rationale             |  Default  |
|  **0** | Incompatible                            |     No     | —                                                                                    |    Yes    |

*Normative hooks.* The **Trust & Assurance Calculus (B.3)** aggregates CL penalties into confidence scores; **D.2** may mandate CL≥2 for safety‑critical enactments.

### 14.3 Typical bridges (worked patterns)

* **BPMN Task ↔ PROV Activity.**
  `substitutesFor(Task@BPMN → Activity@PROV)` with **CL=2**; **lost:** BPMN control‑flow guards; **kept:** “bounded occurrence consuming/producing entities.”
  *Effect.* A Work logged as `Activity@PROV` may satisfy a step requiring a `Task@BPMN` **if** an extra guard enforces the BPMN pre‑/post‑conditions.

* **Essence Alpha‑State ↔ RoleStateGraph state.**
  `substitutesFor(“Alpha.State:Ready”@Essence → “Ready”@RSG)` with **CL=2**; **lost:** Alpha‑specific narrative criteria; **kept:** checklist‑based readiness.
  *Effect.* A team may reuse Essence states as labels in RSG, but still maintains local checklists as **StateAssertions**.

* **ITIL Service Owner ↔ RBAC Administrator.**
  Typically **CL=1** and **directional** (Administrator\@RBAC → ServiceOwner\@ITIL) **rejected** unless a policy Bridge enumerates compensating controls.
  *Effect.* Prevents “ops admin = service owner” conflations without an explicit waiver.

### 14.4 Bridge invariants

* **Local first.** Substitution never overrides in‑Context `⊥`, `⊗`, or `≤`.
* **Evidence trail.** Every Cross‑context enactment relying on a Bridge **shall** reference its Bridge id in the `U.Work` justification.
* **Loss visibility.** The Bridge **must** state which **RCS characteristics** are preserved vs dropped; if a dropped characteristic is required by the step, substitution is **invalid**, regardless of CL.

---

## 15 · Consequences (what you can count on)

**Benefits**

1. **No type explosion.** Structure stays stable; function lives in RoleAssignments with small, local lattices.
2. **Traceable authority.** Every `U.Work` has a clean chain: **performedBy → RoleAssignment → Role → (RCS,RSG) → Context**.
3. **Safe heterogeneity.** Different Contexts can use the same badge name differently; conflicts are dissolved by locality and explicit Bridges.
4. **Didactic economy.** One mental form — `Holder#Role:Context@Window` — covers factories, clouds, labs, and libraries.
5. **Strong SoD.** Incompatibilities (`⊥`) and bundles (`⊗`) are first‑class; audits become mechanical.
6. **Assurance‑ready.** RSG + StateAssertions convert checklists into **explicit gates**; CL penalties quantify Cross‑context risk.
7. **Temporal honesty.** Windows encode the ebb and flow of assignments without history loss.

**Costs / discipline required**

1. **RoleDescription work.** Each Context needs a minimal RoleDescription (name, RCS, RSG, checklists).
2. **Bridge authorship.** Cross‑context work requires explicit Bridges with CL & loss notes.
3. **Vocabulary hygiene.** Teams must stop using context‑less role labels.

---

## 16 · Rationale (why this specific design)

* **Strict Distinction (A.7).** Keeps **identity** (Holon) separate from **assignment** (RoleAssignment), **behaviour** (Method/Work), and **knowledge** (Episteme).
* **Ontological Parsimony (A.11).** One universal binding, three tiny in‑Context relations (`≤, ⊥, ⊗`), no global role types.
* **Universal Core (A.8).** Same mechanism works across **systems** (machines, software, teams) and **epistemes** (standards, requirements), demonstrated in §9.
* **Lexical discipline (E.10.D1 & E.10.D2).** Roles are **context‑local**; descriptions (RCS, RSG) are **descriptions of intensional roles**, not the roles themselves.
* **Alignment with SoTA.**

  * **DDD.** Elevates **Bounded Context** from software to a universal meaning frame.
  * **UFO / OntoUML.** Roles as anti‑rigid, context‑dependent types.
  * **OMG Essence.** RSG generalises Alpha state graphs with explicit checklists and enactability flags.
  * **RBAC & Assurance.** First‑class SoD and auditable windows; CL penalties match modern safety/security practice.
  * **PROV‑O.** Clean separation of Activity (Work) from Association (who held which role).

---

## 17 · Relations (where this pattern sits)

**Builds on / depends on**

* **A.1 Holonic Foundation** — `U.Holon` (holders).
* **A.1.1 `U.BoundedContext`** — the “Context of meaning.”
* **A.2 Role Taxonomy** — role families (Agential / Transformer / Observer / Speech; Epistemic‑Status / Normative / Service‑Governance).
* **E.10.D1 (D.CTX)** & **E.10.D2 (Strict Distinction of intensional vs description)** — locality & description discipline.

**Enables / instantiated by**

* **A.15 Role–Method–Work Alignment** — step gating, performer linking, evaluation hooks.
* **B.1 Γ‑algebra** — constructors/observers are simply roles enacted by systems.
* **B.3 Trust & Assurance Calculus** — CL penalties on Bridges; evidence from StateAssertions.
* **D.2 Multi‑Scale Ethics** — duties attach to roles; SoD encoded via `⊥`.
* **F‑cluster (Unification Method)** — F.1–F.4 define Contexts and local senses; F.9 defines Bridges consumed here.

**Interacts with**

* **C.* Architheories*\* (Sys‑CAL, KD‑CAL, Method‑CAL, CHR‑CAL) — enactment hooks, measurement via Observations.
* **Service & Deontics (Part D/E)** — obligations and acceptance evaluated against role‑gated Work.

## 18 · Teaching distillation (60‑second recap)

> “Give every action a **badge with a Context**. The badge is a **`U.RoleAssignment`**: `Holder#Role:Context@Window`.
> The badge is **valid** in time (window) and **green** in state (RSG + **StateAssertion**).
> A **Method step** names the badges it needs; a **Work** cites the exact badge that enacted it.
> If a badge comes from another Context, cross with a **Bridge** and respect its **CL penalty**.
> Keep SoD with `⊥`, reuse expertise with `≤`, and require combos with `⊗`.
> Documents don’t act — they hold **status roles**; **only systems enact Work**.
> With this, factories, clouds, and knowledge all speak the same, small grammar.”


# A.2.2 — U.Capability  \[D]

## 1 · Context (plain‑language motivation)

In real projects we must answer two different questions:

* **“Can this system do X?”** — this is about an **ability** inherent to the system.
* **“Is this system assigned to do X here and now?”** — this is about an **assignment** (a **Role assignment**) inside a bounded context.

Teams frequently blur the two, and then further mix them with **how** the work is done (the **Method**) and **what actually happened** (the **Work**). `U.Capability` isolates the **ability characteristic** so that you can plan realistically, staff responsibly, and audit cleanly.

---

## 2 · Problem (what goes wrong without this concept)

1. **Permission ≠ ability.** A Role assignment authorizes execution in a context; it does **not** prove the system can meet the required **WorkScope** and **WorkMeasures**.
2. **Recipe ≠ ability.** A Method says *how* to do something; it does not guarantee that *this* holder can meet the target outcomes under the required constraints.
3. **Execution log ≠ ability.** A past Work record does not, by itself, establish a stable ability; conditions may have been favorable or unique.
4. **Cross‑team confusion.** Enterprise terms like “capability”, “service”, and the old “function” are used interchangeably; planning, staffing, and assurance become fragile.

---

## 3 · Forces (what we must balance)

| Force                                   | Tension we resolve                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Stability vs. change**                | Ability is a relatively stable property of a system, yet it evolves with upgrades, wear, calibration, and environment.               |
| **Universality vs. domain‑specificity** | One universal notion must serve robots, teams, and software services, while letting each domain keep its own performance vocabulary. |
| **Evidence vs. simplicity**             | We want an ability claim to be evidence‑backed, but the core idea must stay simple enough for planning conversations.                |
| **Local conditions vs. reusability**    | Ability depends on conditions (inputs, environment); still, the concept must be reusable across contexts via explicit scoping.       |

---

## 4 · Solution — define the ability characteristic explicitly

### 4.1 Definition
**`U.Capability`** is a **property of a `U.System`** that states its **ability to produce a class of outcomes** (i.e., execute a class of Work) **within a declared `U.WorkScope` (conditions/assumptions) and meeting stated `U.WorkMeasures`**. It is **not** an assignment (Role), **not** a recipe (Method), and **not** an execution (Work).


> **One-liner to remember:** *Capability = “can do (within its **WorkScope** and measures)”*, independent of *“is assigned now”* or *“did do at time t”*.

**Capability declaration (summary).** A capability SHALL declare, as **separate** items:
* **`U.WorkScope`** (*Work scope*) — the set of `U.ContextSlice` under which the capability can deliver the intended `U.Work` (see **A.2.6 §6.4**);
* **`U.WorkMeasures`** — measurable targets with units evaluated on a **JobSlice** (R‑lane facet);
* **`U.QualificationWindow`** — the time policy that governs operational admissibility at **`Γ_time`** (R‑lane facet).
**Note.** This separation supersedes the legacy “envelope + measures + validity interval” bundle.

### 4.2 Conceptual descriptors (not a data schema)

When you describe a capability in a model or a review, anchor it by answering these five didactic prompts:

1. **Holder:** *Whose ability is this?* → a specific `U.System`.
2. **Context:** *In which bounded context were the measures established?* → `U.BoundedContext` (strongly recommended for clarity and comparability).
3. **Task family:** *Ability to do **what kind** of work?* → reference the relevant **MethodDescription**(s) or method family the system can execute.
4. **WorkScope:** *Under what conditions?* → inputs/resources/environment assumptions (e.g., voltage, pressure, ambient, tool head).
5. **Performance measures:** *With what bounds?* → CHR‑style measures (throughput, precision, latency, reliability, MTBF…) with ranges/targets.

Optional descriptors that improve trust without adding bureaucracy:

* **QualificationWindow:** calibration/qualification window for the stated **WorkScope** (abilities drift).
* **Evidence:** links to test reports, certifications, prior Work summaries (as **Episteme**).
* **Degradation/upgrade notes:** known change points that affect the **WorkScope**.

> **Didactic guardrail:** Capabilities are stated in **positive, measurable terms** (“can weld seam type W at ±0.2 mm up to 12/min at 18 °C–30 °C”). Avoid role words (“welder”) or recipe detail (step flows) here.

### 4.3 Shorthand for everyday speech

To keep discussions terse yet precise, teams often write:

* **“S#17 can \<MethodDescription / task family> @ \<WorkScope> → \<measures>.”**
* Or as a bullet in a capability table scoped to a context, e.g., *AssemblyLine\_2025 Capability Sheet*.

This is not a formal notation—just a consistent way to keep the five prompts in view.

## 5 · Clear distinctions (litmus tests managers can apply)

| If you are talking about…                  | Use                     | Litmus test                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **assignment** (who is being what, where) | **Role → Role assignment** | Can you reassign to another holder without changing the system’s composition? If yes → Role. |
| **Ability** (can do within bounds)         | **Capability**          | Would you still say “can do” even if not currently assigned? If yes → Capability.           |
| **Recipe** (how‑to)                        | **Method / MethodDescription** | Has inputs/outputs and steps but no date/time.                                               |
| **Execution** (what happened)              | **Work**                | Has a start/end, consumed resources, left a log.                                             |
| **External promise**                       | **Service**             | Framed as “we provide/guarantee to others.”                                                  |
| **Law/model of change**                    | **Dynamics**            | Describes state evolution, not an ability of one system.                                     |

**Two useful corollaries**

* A step in a Method may **require** a Role; **optionally** it may also stipulate a **capability threshold** (e.g., precision ≤ 0.2 mm). assignment and ability are checked separately.
* A Service depends on **having** the needed capabilities **and** being **assigned** to deliver under the Service’s context.

---

## 6 · Archetypal grounding (parallel structural and organizational examples)

### 6.1 Physical system on a line (structural example)

* **Holder:** `RobotArm_A` (`U.System`).
* **Task family:** seam welding per `Weld_MIG_v3` **MethodDescription**.
* **WorkScope:** workpiece steel grades S235–S355; ambient 18–30 °C; argon mix 92–95 %; torch T‑MIG‑07.
* **Measures:** bead width 6.0 mm ± 0.2 mm; throughput ≤ 12 seams/min; defect rate < 0.5 %.
* **Context:** `AssemblyLine_2025`.
* **Readable claim:** *RobotArm\_A can execute Weld\_MIG\_v3 within the stated **WorkScope** at the stated measures (AssemblyLine\_2025).*
* **What this is not:** It is **not** “the welder”—that is a **Role assignment** when assigned on a shift. It is **not** the weld recipe— that is the **MethodDescription**.

### 6.2 Software service in operations (structural, cyber-physical)

* **Holder:** `PlannerService_v4` (deployed system).
* **Task family:** job‑shop schedule generation per `JS_Schedule_v4` MethodDescription.
* **WorkScope:** 50–500 jobs; 5–40 machines; hard deadlines only; network latency ≤ 20 ms.
* **Measures:** schedule completion within 0.95 of theoretical optimum (benchmark set), 98 % on‑time delivery in simulation.
* **Context:** `PlantScheduling_2025`.
* **Use:** Steps that “require ScheduleGeneration capability ≥ 0.90 optimality” will only pass if the holder’s capability meets or exceeds that bound.

### 6.3 Organizational unit (enterprise sense)

* **Holder:** `FinanceDept` (`U.System` as OrgUnit).
* **Task family:** period close per `CloseBooks_v3` MethodDescription.
* **WorkScope:** IFRS; ERP v12; 8 legal entities; staffing ≥ 6 FTE; cut‑off rules X.
* **Measures:** close in ≤ 5 business days; adjustment error rate < 0.2 %.
* **Context:** `OperatingModel_2025`.
* **Distinction:** This is **ability**; the **Service** “Provide month‑end close” is the external promise derived from this ability once formally offered.

---

## 7 · Bias‑Annotation (as in cluster‑E patterns)

* **Lenses tested:** `Arch`, `Prag`, `Did`, `Epist`.
* **Scope declaration:** Universal; holder constrained to `U.System`.
* **Rationale:** Gives the kernel a clean, reusable **ability characteristic** so Role (assignment), Method (recipe), Work (execution), and Service (promise) do not collapse into each other. Keeps planning talk truthful and checkable without introducing governance machinery here.

## 8 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A2.2‑1 (Holder type).**
A capability **belongs to** a **`U.System`** (physical, cyber, socio‑technical, or organizational). Capabilities are **not** assigned to `U.Episteme`.

**CC‑A2.2‑2 (Separation of concerns).**
A capability is **not** a Role, **not** a Method/MethodDescription, **not** a Work, and **not** a Service. Models **SHALL NOT** use capability declarations to stand in for assignments, recipes, executions, or promises.

**CC‑A2.2‑3 (WorkScope required for operational use).**
When a capability is used to qualify a step or to support planning, its statement **MUST** name a **WorkScope** (conditions/assumptions) and **WorkMeasures** (targets/ranges). **Guards that admit Work MUST test** that the **holder’s WorkScope covers the step’s JobSlice** (i.e., `WorkScope ⊇ JobSlice`) **and that WorkMeasures meet the step’s thresholds, with an explicit `Γ_time` window bound**. Without a WorkScope and measures, a capability is advisory and **SHALL NOT** be used for step admission or assurance claims.

**CC‑A2.2‑4 (Context anchor).**
Capability statements that drive operational decisions **MUST** be anchored to a **`U.BoundedContext`** (the “Context” whose vocabulary and test norms apply).

**CC‑A2.2‑5 (QualificationWindow).**
When capabilities are used operationally (e.g., to gate Work), the statement **MUST** carry a **QualificationWindow** (calibration window, software version window, etc.) and the guard **MUST name the `Γ_time` window** used for the check. Outside the QualificationWindow, the claim is not admissible for gating.

**CC‑A2.2‑6 (Past work remains past).**
Updates to a capability statement **SHALL NOT** retroactively invalidate already recorded Work. Past Work is judged against the capability declaration that was valid **at the time of execution**.

**CC‑A2.2‑7 (Threshold checks are orthogonal to roles).**
A step that requires both a Role and a capability threshold admits a Work only if **both** are satisfied: (i) the performer’s **Role assignment** is active in the step window; (ii) the **holder’s capability** meets or exceeds the threshold **with `WorkScope ⊇ JobSlice` and within the **QualificationWindow** at the named **`Γ_time`**.**

**CC‑A2.2‑8 (Derived capabilities).**
If a capability is claimed for a **composite system** (assembled by Γ), the claim **MUST** be stated as a property of that composite holder (not of its parts) with clear dependency notes (e.g., “valid while Subsystem B meets X”). Details of derivation belong to the context’s methodology, not to this definition.

**CC‑A2.2‑9 (No capability for epistemes).**
Algorithms, standards, and documents provide **evidence** or **recipes**; they **do not** “have capability.” Only systems do.

**CC-A2.2-10 (`Γ_time` selector in guards).**
Scope-sensitive guards (including Method–Work gates) **MUST** include an explicit **`Γ_time`** selector indicating the window *W* over which **ScopeCoverage** and **WorkMeasures** are evaluated.

## 9 · Capability thresholds on steps (how A.15 uses this concept)

A step in a **Method** may define **required roles** (assignment) and **capability thresholds** (ability). A Work passes the gate if:

1. **assignment check:** the Work’s `performedBy` points to a valid **Role assignment** that covers the step window and satisfies the role relation (including specialization `≤` inside the context).
2. **Ability check:** the **holder** of that Role assignment has a **capability** whose **WorkScope covers the step’s JobSlice** (i.e., declared superset) and whose **WorkMeasures** meet the step’s threshold(s) **within `Γ_time(W)` and while the capability’s **QualificationWindow** includes *W***.

**Idioms managers can reuse (plain text):**

* *“S1 requires `IncisionOperatorRole` and Precision ≤ 0.2 mm (OR\_2025 norms) **in window W**.”*
* *“S2 requires `PlannerRole`, **WorkScope ⊇ JobSlice\[W]**, and Optimality ≥ 0.90 on `JS_Schedule_v4`.”*

**What to avoid:**

* Putting “Precision ≤ 0.2 mm” into the Role name. Keep thresholds attached to the **step**; keep **ability** on the **holder**.

---

## 10 · Time and change (calibration, drift, upgrades)

Capabilities are **stable but not static**. Three simple practices keep reasoning honest:

* **Qualification windows.** Abilities drift. Put a **QualificationWindow** on the statement (e.g., “valid for software v4.2; recalibration due 2025-09-30”).
* **Change points.** Note upgrades/downgrades that affect the WorkScope or measures.
* **Snapshot at execution.** When Work is recorded, it is implicitly tied to the **then‑current** capability statement; later edits do not rewrite history (see CC‑A2.2‑6).

**Manager’s rule of thumb:** if you would reschedule a job after a tool change, the capability statement needs a new window.

---

## 11 · Composition and Γ (how assembled systems “can do”)

Γ builds a **new holder** (a composite system). Its capability is not the algebraic sum of parts; it is an **ability of the whole** under its own WorkScope.

* **Express at the whole.** “Cell\_3 can place 12 PCB/min with ±0.1 mm” — that is a capability of **Cell\_3**, not of the pick‑and‑place head alone.
* **State dependencies.** “Valid while Feeder\_A delivers reels at ≥ X; vision subsystem calibrated ≤ 72 h ago.”
* **Constructor vs. transformer.** The **ConstructorRole** builds the composite (Γ); the resulting **TransformerRole** may later act on products. Capability belongs to the holder relevant to the action (builder’s ability vs operator’s ability).

---

## 12 · Interaction with Service (external promise)

A **Service** is an **external promise**. It relies on capability but is not identical to it.

* **From capability to service.** You normally **derive** a Service by taking a capability and **fixing** the promise outward (e.g., “We guarantee close ≤ 5 days”).
* **From service back to capability.** If the promise raises the bar (e.g., tighter SLA), the underlying capability must meet or exceed it under the service’s context.
* **Staffing.** Delivering a Service still requires **Role assignments**; capability alone does not authorize action.

**Memory aid:** Capability = *can do*; Service = *promise to others that we will do*.

---

## 13 · Interaction with Dynamics (laws vs. abilities)

* **Dynamics** describe **how states evolve** (models, laws, trajectories).
* **Capability** says **what this system can achieve** within an WorkScope.
* Dynamics often serve as **evidence** or **explanatory models** for capability but are **not** the capability itself.

**Physics example:** an “isothermal process” (process here as transformation) is a **Work** instance whose path is explained by a **Dynamics** episteme; a lab rig’s ability to run that path repeatably is its **capability**.

## 14 · Anti‑patterns (and the right move)

* **Role‑as‑capability.** “Welder role ensures ±0.2 mm.” → Keep **role** as assignment; put **precision** in a **capability** on the holder; put the **threshold** on the **step**.
* **Recipe‑as‑capability.** “We have the ‘Etch\_Al2O3’ capability.” → Recipe is **Method/MethodDescription**; ability is “can execute Etch\_Al2O3 within WorkScope E at measures M.”
* **Work‑as‑capability.** “We did it once, so we can.” → One Work log is not a stable ability; state envelope and measures if you want a capability claim.
* **Context‑less claims.** “This tool can machine titanium.” → Say **where and under what bounds** (context + WorkScope + measures).
* **Stuffing capabilities into BoM/PBS.** Structure lists **what it is**; capabilities belong to **what it can do** (the holder), not inside the parts list.
* **Service‑as‑capability.** “We have the Month‑end Close capability (promise).” → Promise is **Service**; ability is internal, promise is external.

---

## 15 · Migration notes (quick wins for existing texts)

1. **Underline WorkScopes.** For every “can do” sentence, add **conditions** and **measures**; otherwise treat it as background color, not a gate.
2. **Pull thresholds out of roles.** Move “≤ 0.2 mm”, “≥ 0.90 optimality” from role labels into **step requirements**; leave roles clean (assignments).
3. **Pin contexts.** Add the bounded context name to each capability table (“Capability Sheet — AssemblyLine\_2025”).
4. **Snapshot validity.** Add a “valid through” column (software version or calibration horizon).
5. **Separate recipe/execution.** Move flowcharts under **MethodDescription**, runs under **Work**; link the capability to the **holder** with references to those specs.

## 16 · Consequences

| Benefits                                                                                           | Trade‑offs / mitigations                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Truthful planning.** Schedulers and managers can ask “can do?” independently of “assigned now?” | **Extra column in tables.** Adding scope/measures/valid‑through is a small burden that repays itself in fewer reschedules. |
| **Safer gating.** Steps gate on both role and ability; fewer silent failures.                      | **Two checks instead of one.** Keep the checklist simple: *badge + bounds*.                                                   |
| **Clear service design.** Services become explicit promises built on visible abilities.            | **Temptation to over‑promise.** Keep service SLOs within demonstrated capability measures.                                    |
| **Clean separation with Dynamics and PBS/SBS.** No more “process” or “function” soup.              | **Some retraining.** Use the litmus tables (from the lexical rules) during onboarding.                                        |

## A.2.3 · `U.Service` \[D]

### 1 · Context

Across domains the word **service** is used for many different things: a server or **provider**, an **API**, a **procedure**, a **run**, a **department**, even a **product bundle**. Such polysemy is productive in everyday speech but toxic in a normative model. FPF needs a **single, minimal, trans‑disciplinary meaning** that stays stable from cloud computing to public administration and manufacturing utilities.

In the Role–Method–Work alignment, **service** must say something **external‑facing** and **consumer‑oriented**, yet remain separate from *how* the provider does it (Method/MethodDescription) and *what actually happened* (Work).

> Intuition: a **service** is the promise you advertise and are judged by; **work** is what you do to keep that promise; **method/spec** is how you know what to do.

#### Lexical note (L‑SERV)

The words *service/service‑level/service use/service access* are **ambiguous** across domains. In the kernel we reserve **`U.Service`** for the unified concept below. Other senses (department, server, microservice binary, help‑desk ticket, etc.) **must** be mapped via `U.RoleAssignment` to roles (`…#ServiceProviderRole:Context`), to **`U.System`**, **`U.Method/MethodDescription`**, or **`U.Work`**, inside the appropriate `U.BoundedContext`. (A short lexical rule **L‑SERV** will be added to E.10 alongside L‑FUNC/L‑PROC/L‑SCHED/L‑ACT.)

---

### 2 · Problem

Without a first‑class `U.Service`, models drift into five recurring errors:

1. **Provider = Service.** Calling the **system** or **team** “the service” collapses structure with promise.
2. **API = Service.** Treating an **interface/endpoint** as the service hides the consumer‑oriented promise (effect + acceptance).
3. **Process = Service.** Mapping a **procedure/Method** (or a WorkPlan) to “service” confuses recipe/schedule with the external commitment.
4. **Run = Service.** Logging **Work** as “a service” erases the contract/promise layer and breaks SLA reasoning.
5. **Business ontology lock‑in.** Large domain schemes (e.g., “business service” stacks) are imported wholesale, losing FPF’s universality and comparability across contexts.

| Force                                       | Tension                                                                                                       |

| **Specification vs execution**              | Service is a **specifiable** obligation; value is **realised** only by runs of Work.                          |
| **Universality vs domain richness**         | One kernel meaning must cover IT, utilities, healthcare, public services—without absorbing domain taxonomies. |
| **Measurability vs privacy**                | Consumers need SLO/SLA and outcomes; providers want implementation freedom (Method autonomy).                 |
| **Stability vs evolution**                  | Services version and change without invalidating prior Work evidence.                                         |

---

### 4 · Solution — The unified concept `U.Service`

**Definition (normative).**
Within a `U.BoundedContext`, a **`U.Service`** is an **externally oriented commitment**: a **context‑local promise** that a provider **Role** will make a **specified external effect** available to eligible consumers through a **declared access** and **declared acceptance criteria** (SLO/SLA‑like targets). A `U.Service` does **not** prescribe *how* the provider fulfils it (that is `U.Method/MethodDescription`), nor is it the **execution** (that is `U.Work`).

* **Type:** `U.Episteme` (a spec/contract on a carrier).
* **Scope:** design‑time concept; judged at run‑time by evidence from `U.Work`.
* **Time stance:** design-time concept; judged at run-time by evidence from `U.Work`.
* **Orientation:** consumer‑facing (“what you can rely on”), as opposed to capability (“what we can do”).

#### 4.1 · Core structure (minimal fields)

```
U.Service {
  context        : U.BoundedContext,   // where the promise is meaningful
  purpose        : Text/Episteme,      // the externally observable effect/value
  providerRole   : U.Role,             // role kind that may provide it (not a person/system)
  consumerRole?  : U.Role,             // optional role kind allowed to consume
  claimScope?    : U.ClaimScope,       // where the promise holds (G) — operating conditions/populations/locales
  accessSpec?    : U.MethodDescription,       // how consumers may request/use (interface/eligibility)
  acceptanceSpec : U.Episteme,         // targets: SLO/SLA, quality/throughput/latency/accuracy…
  realizationSpec?: P(U.MethodDescription),   // typical internal specs used by providers (non-binding)
  unitOfDelivery?: Episteme,           // how delivered units are counted/measured
  version?       : SemVer/Text,
  timespan?      : Interval
}
```

* `providerRole` and `consumerRole` are **role kinds**; the actual performers are **RoleAssignings** at run‑time.
* `acceptanceSpec` defines **what counts as fulfilled** (the test).
* `accessSpec` is **how to ask** (eligibility, protocol, counter, desk, API).
* `realizationSpec` is only informative in the kernel (“typical methods”); providers retain **Method autonomy**.

#### 4.2 · What `U.Service` is **not**

* **Not a provider:** use `System#ServiceProviderRole:Context` `U.RoleAssignment`.
* **Not a method/recipe:** that is `U.Method/MethodDescription`.
* **Not a run/incident/ticket:** that is `U.Work`.
* **Not a schedule:** that is `U.WorkPlan`.
* **Not a capability:** capability is **provider‑intrinsic ability**; service is **outward promise**. A service may **require** certain capabilities, but it **is not** the capability.
* **Not a scope label:** do **not** use *applicability*, *envelope*, *generality*, or *validity* as **scope characteristics**; declare **Claim scope (G)** or **Work scope** explicitly where needed (A.2.6).

#### 4.3 · Position in the enactment chain

* **Design‑time:**
  The context **declares Claim scope (G)** for acceptance (operating conditions, populations, locales) per A.2.6.
  The context may assert: `bindsCapability(ServiceProviderRole, Capability)`.
  Providers choose `Method/MethodDescription` to realise the service.

* **Run‑time:**
  A **consumer** performs `Work` (e.g., a request/visit) — `performedBy: ConsumerRoleAssigning`.
  The **provider** performs `Work` to fulfil the service — `performedBy: ProviderRoleAssigning`.
  Delivered `Work` instances are evaluated against `acceptanceSpec` and **counted** via `unitOfDelivery`.
  SLA/SLO outcomes are therefore functions over **Work evidence**, not over the Service object itself.

> **Memory hook:** *Service promises, Method describes, Work proves.*

---

### 5 · Archetypal grounding (engineer‑manager friendly)

| Domain                    | **`U.Service` (promise)**                                 | Provider & Consumer (as Roles)                                   | Access (how to ask)                  | Fulfilment (Work)                        | Typical acceptance targets                  |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Cloud/IT**              | “**Object Storage**: durable PUT/GET of blobs up to 5 TB” | `CloudTeam#ServiceProviderRole`, `BackupJob#ServiceConsumerRole` | `S3_API_Spec_vX` (`MethodDescription`)      | Each PUT/GET run; data durability checks | Availability ≥ 99.9%, durability 11×9       |
| **Manufacturing Utility** | “**Compressed air** at 8 bar in Zone B”                   | `Maintenance#Provider`, `LineB#Consumer`                         | Manifold access rules (`AccessSpec`) | Compressor cycles & delivery logs        | Pressure window, purity class, flow ceiling |
| **Public Service**        | “**Passport issuance** within 20 days”                    | `Agency#Issuer`, `Citizen#Applicant`                             | Portal/desk SOP (`AccessSpec`)       | Case handling runs                       | Lead time ≤ 20 days, defect ≤ 1%            |

**Key takeaway:** the **same kernel object** models S3, a plant utility, and a government service: a **promise with access and acceptance**. Everything else (APIs, compressors, clerks, workflows, tickets) is mapped via **Role/Method/Work**.

---

### 6 · Mapping the common “service” picture to FPF (didactic bridge)

The popular service diagrams (provider ↔ access ↔ use ↔ capability/activity) map to FPF as follows:

* **Agent (as Service Provider)** → `System#ServiceProviderRole:Context` (`U.RoleAssignment`).
* **Service Agreement / SLA** → `U.Service.acceptanceSpec` (+ optional `WorkPlan` for windows).
* **Operating conditions / “where the promise holds”** → `claimScope : U.ClaimScope (G)` (or embedded in `acceptanceSpec`) per A.2.6.
* **Service Presence / Access** → `accessSpec : MethodDescription` (interface/eligibility); actual endpoints are **systems** playing interface roles.
* **Individual Service Use** → **consumer and provider `U.Work`** instances linked to the `U.Service` they fulfil.
* **Service‑Enabled Capability / Activity** → effects on the consumer side: either a **Capability** gained/used, or **Work** performed; do **not** reify as a new kernel type.

(Where a domain needs richer structures—catalogs, exposure layers, charging, entitlement—model them **in the domain context** and relate them to `U.Service` via `U.RoleAssignment` and alignment bridges.)

## 7 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A2.3‑1 (Type).**
`U.Service` **IS** an `U.Episteme` (a consumer‑facing promise on a carrier). It is **not** a `U.System`, **not** a `U.Method/MethodDescription`, **not** a `U.Work`, and **not** a `U.WorkPlan`.

**CC‑A2.3‑2 (Context).**
Every Service **MUST** be declared **inside** a `U.BoundedContext`. Names and meaning are **local**; cross‑context reuse requires a Bridge (`U.Alignment`).

**CC‑A2.3‑3 (Role kinds, not people/systems).**
`providerRole` and (if used) `consumerRole` **MUST** be **role kinds** (see A.2). Actual performers at run‑time are `U.RoleAssignment`s.

**CC-A2.3-4 (Acceptance).**
`acceptanceSpec` **MUST** be present and **MUST** define how delivered `U.Work` is judged (pass/fail/graded) against declared targets (SLO/SLA-like), and **MUST** declare **Claim scope (G)** where relevant (operating conditions, populations, locales). Every verdict binds to an explicit **Γ_time** window.

**CC‑A2.3‑5 (Access).**
If consumers must request/obtain the service through an interface, `accessSpec` **MUST** reference the MethodDescription that defines eligibility and invocation rules (API/desk/SOP). If the service is ambient (e.g., compressed air on a manifold), accessSpec **MAY** be omitted, but the eligibility condition **MUST** be stated in the context.

**CC‑A2.3‑6 (Unit of delivery).**
If performance is counted/charged, `unitOfDelivery` **SHOULD** be declared (e.g., “request”, “kWh”, “case”).

**CC‑A2.3‑7 (No actuals on Service).**
Resource/time **actuals** and incident logs **MUST** attach to `U.Work` only (A.15.1). Services carry no actuals.

**CC‑A2.3‑8 (Capability requirement).**
If the context requires provider abilities, it **MUST** express them as `bindsCapability(providerRole, Capability)` in the context, not by stuffing capabilities into the Service object.

**CC‑A2.3‑9 (Versioning & timespan).**
Services **MAY** carry `version`/`timespan`. A `U.Work` that claims/fulfils a Service **MUST** record which Service version it used.

**CC‑A2.3‑10 (Lexical rule).**
Unqualified uses of *service* (server/team/API/process/ticket) **MUST** be disambiguated per **L‑SERV** (E.10), mapping to `System`/`U.RoleAssignment`/`Method[Spec]`/`Work` as appropriate.

**CC‑A2.3‑11 (No mereology).**
Do **not** place a Service in PBS/SBS or treat it as a part/component. Structural assemblies live in PBS/SBS; Service is a promise.

**CC‑A2.3‑12 (Plan–run split).**
Windows and calendars belong to `U.WorkPlan` (A.15.2). Fulfilment evidence belongs to `U.Work` (A.15.1).

**CC-A2.3-13 (Scope lexicon & guards).**
Deprecated labels *applicability/envelope/generality/validity* **MUST NOT** appear as scope characteristics in guards or conformance blocks. Use **`U.ClaimScope (G)`** for epistemes and **`U.WorkScope`** for capabilities (A.2.6/A.2.2). Scope-sensitive guards **MUST** use **ScopeCoverage** with explicit **Γ_time** selectors.

**CC-A2.3-14 (Bridges & CL).**
Cross-context mappings via Bridges keep **F/G** stable; **CL** penalties apply to **R**. A mapping **MAY** recommend **narrowing** the mapped **Claim scope (G)** as best practice (A.2.6/B-line).

## 8 · Evidence relations & operators (Service ⇄ Work)

To keep the promise → evidence path explicit:

### 8.1 Core relations

* **`claimsService(Work, Service)`** — the Work instance **intends** to fulfil the Service (pre‑verdict).
* **`fulfilsService(Work, Service)`** — the Work instance **meets** the Service’s `acceptanceSpec` (post‑verdict: pass).
* **`acceptanceVerdict(Work)`** → {`pass`, `fail`, `partial`, context‑specific grades} — computed by applying `acceptanceSpec` to Work facts.
* **`usesAccess(Work, MethodDescription)`** — consumer Work that invokes the service via its `accessSpec` (when applicable).

> **Invariant:** `fulfilsService(W,S)` ⇒ `claimsService(W,S)` and `acceptanceVerdict(W)=pass`.
> **Invariant:** A Work can claim/fulfil **multiple** Services only if the context declares a counting policy (no silent double‑counting).

### 8.2 Service performance operators

Let `W(S, T)` be the set of Work that `claimsService(·,S)` within time window `T`. Let `W✓(S, T)` be those with `fulfilsService`.

* **Delivered units:** `delivered(S, T) = |W✓(S, T)|` (or sum per `unitOfDelivery`).
* **Rejection rate:** `rejectRate(S, T) = 1 − |W✓| / |W|` (declare handling of `partial`).
* **Lead time:** average/percentile of `duration(Work)` or of request→completion delta (declare definition).
* **Availability/Uptime:** computed from Work/telemetry events per the context’s definition (declare availability source).
* **Cost‑to‑serve:** sum of `Γ_work` over `W✓` per resource category (A.15.1).

All metrics are **functions of Work evidence**; the Service object is never the bearer of actuals.
Aggregation across time uses `Γ_time` policies (union vs convex hull) chosen by the KPI owner.

---

## 9 · Anti‑patterns (and the right move)

* **“The microservice **is** the service.”**
  A microservice binary is a `U.System`. Make it a provider via `System#ServiceProviderRole:Context`; keep the **promise** in `U.Service`.

* **“The API **is** the service.”**
  The API is typically `accessSpec : MethodDescription` (and systems playing interface roles). The **service** is the promise judged by `acceptanceSpec`.

* **“Our **process** is the service.”**
  Process/recipe is `U.Method/MethodDescription`; schedule is `U.WorkPlan`. The service is **what is promised to the consumer**.

* **“The **ticket** is the service.”**
  A ticket/case is `U.Work` (and perhaps a `WorkPlan` item). Evidence and outcomes sit on Work, not on Service.

* **“Attach cost to the service.”**
  Actual cost/time attach to `U.Work` only (A.15.1). Service metrics are computed **from** Work.

* **“Put service under BoM.”**
  Services are not structural parts. Keep PBS/SBS clean.

* **“Hard‑code people into the service.”**
  Name **role kinds** in `U.Service`; run‑time performers are `U.RoleAssignment`s.

---

## 10 · Migration notes (quick wins)

1. **Name the promises.** List 5–15 consumer‑facing promises your context lives by; reify each as `U.Service` with `acceptanceSpec` and, if needed, `accessSpec` and `unitOfDelivery`.
2. **Separate provider from service.** Keep systems/teams as `U.System`; make them providers via `…#ServiceProviderRole:Context`.
3. **Wire evidence.** Ensure every relevant `U.Work` has `claimsService` (and `fulfilsService` post‑verdict).
4. **Choose metrics.** For each Service, define 2–4 KPIs and the **exact** Work-based formulas (availability, lead-time, rejection rate, cost-to-serve), and declare the **Claim scope (G)** and **Γ_time** policy used for each KPI.
5. **Bridge domains.** If a business ontology already exists (“business/technical/internal service”), keep it in its own context and map to `U.Service` via Bridges.
6. **Tidy language.** Apply **L‑SERV**: ban “service” as a synonym for server/team/process/ticket in kernel narratives; map them explicitly.

---

## 11 · Relations

* **Builds on:** A.1.1 `U.BoundedContext`; A.2 `U.Role`; A.2.1 `U.RoleAssignment`; A.2.2 `U.Capability`; **A.2.6 `U.Scope` / `U.ClaimScope (G)` / `U.WorkScope`**.
* **Coordinates with:** A.3.1 `U.Method`; A.3.2 `U.MethodDescription`; A.15.1 `U.Work`; A.15.2 `U.WorkPlan`; **B-line Bridges & CL (CL→R; may recommend ΔG narrowing)**.
* **Constrained by lexical rules:** **E.10 L‑SERV** (service disambiguation); also **L‑FUNC**, **L‑PROC**, **L‑SCHED**, **L‑ACT**.
* **Informs:** Reporting/assurance patterns (service KPIs, SLA dashboards); catalog/exposure patterns in domain contexts.

---

## 12 · Didactic quick cards (engineer‑manager ready)

* **Service = Promise.** *What we advertise and are judged by.*
* **Method/Spec = Recipe.** *How we usually do it (provider‑internal).*
* **Work = Evidence.** *What actually happened and consumed resources.*
* **Provider/Consumer = Roles.** *assignment via RoleAssigning at run‑time.*
* **Metrics from Work.** *Uptime, lead time, quality are computed from Work, not from the Service object.*
* **Keep PBS/SBS clean.** *Services are not parts; they are promises.*

## A.2.4 — `U.EvidenceRole` \[D]

> *This pattern defines how a knowledge artefact (“episteme”) serves as **evidence** for a specific claim or theory **inside a bounded context**. It is a **non‑behavioural** role enacted via `U.RoleAssignment`; the binding **must** declare the **target claim**, the **claim‑scope**, and a **timespan of relevance**. Evidence is a classificatory status of an episteme; it is not an action and it is not an assignment of an actor.*

### 1 · Context and intent

FPF separates **what exists** (holons and their kinds) from **what acts** (systems under roles performing work) and from **what is known** (epistemes carried on symbols). Roles are contextual masks that holons may wear; role meanings are **local to a `U.BoundedContext`**. In this setting, we need a kernel‑level way to say that *this* episteme **counts as evidence** about *that* claim, **here**, and **for this period**, without confusing evidence with services, methods, or work. 

**Intent.** Provide one uniform, discipline‑neutral role by which an episteme can be assigned as evidence, while keeping:

* **Agency** on systems performing `U.Work` (not on epistemes).
* **Promise** and contractual language on `U.Service` (not on evidence).
* **Recipe** and eligibility on `U.Method` / `U.MethodDescription` (not on evidence).

### 2 · Problem

1. **Anthropomorphising epistemes.** Models say “the paper proves…”, implicitly treating a document as an actor.
2. **Citation without scope.** Links exist but lack explicit **target claim**, **applicability scope**, and **time window**.
3. **Deductive versus empirical conflation.** A formal derivation and a lab dataset are both called “support” although their semantics and ageing differ.
4. **Staleness and drift.** Empirical evidence ages; without explicit validity windows, stale evidence keeps influencing conclusions.
5. **Cross‑context leakage.** Evidence is interpreted as “global,” skipping the bridge that is required to move meaning across contexts.

### 3 · Forces

| Force                                     | Tension to resolve                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality versus domain practice**   | One role must cover proofs, datasets, replications, benchmarks, model fits, calibrations.         |
| **Static truth versus ageing confidence** | Axiomatic proofs are stable relative to a theory; empirical evidence decays and requires refresh. |
| **Local meaning versus reuse**            | Meaning is context‑local; reuse must pass through explicit bridges, not tacit “global truth.”     |
| **Clarity versus brevity**                | Kernel must stay expressive without importing domain governance or tooling procedures.            |

### 4 · Solution — Term and definition

**Term.**
`U.EvidenceRole` — a **non-behavioural role** that a `U.Episteme` may play **inside a `U.BoundedContext`** to serve as **evidence** for a declared target claim (or theory/version).
The target claim, its applicability scope, polarity, weighting model, and other normative facets are **properties of the `U.EvidenceRole` definition itself** *within that bounded context*.

**How it is enacted.**
The role is enacted by a standard `U.RoleAssignment` that connects:

```
RoleAssigning {
  holder  : U.Episteme,        // the artefact: paper, proof, dataset, report…
  role    : U.EvidenceRole,    // a context-defined role with normative properties
  context : U.BoundedContext   // where the role definition is valid
  timespan?: Interval          // optional: relevance window for this specific assignment
}
```

The **normative properties** of the role (e.g., `claimRef`, `claimScope`, `polarity`, `weightModelRef`) are set in the **role’s definition** in the given `U.BoundedContext`, not in the binding.
`U.RoleAssignment` carries only the linkage between a concrete episteme and a role already defined and attributed in that context.

> **Non-behavioural guard.** The holder is an episteme; any actions that produced it are `U.Work` performed by systems. Evidence classifies an artefact’s evidential status; it does not itself enact behaviour.

**Minimal readable grammar (informative).**
`<Episteme>#<EvidenceRole>:<Context>` — where `<EvidenceRole>` in `<Context>` already normatively specifies `polarity Claim / Scope [weight]`.

**Examples.**

* In `Cardio_2026`, `ModelFitEvidenceRole` is defined with:
  `claim = β-blocker > placebo`, `claimScope = adults 40–65`, `polarity = supports`, `weightModelRef = KD:SupportMeasure`.
  Binding:
  `Trial-R3.csv#ModelFitEvidenceRole:Cardio_2026`.

* In `Theory_T`, `AxiomaticProofRole` is defined with:
  `claim = Theorem-12`, `claimScope = all x ∈ D`, `polarity = supports`.
  Binding:
  `Lemma-12.proof#AxiomaticProofRole:Theory_T`.


### 5 · Role family and specialisations

`U.EvidenceRole` is a **role kind** refined by **specialisation** (no mereology of roles). The recommended, substrate‑neutral specialisations are:

**5.1 Axiomatic line (deductive inside a fixed theory)**

* **`AxiomaticProofRole`** — a proof that **entails** a target statement in a declared `U.TheoryVersion`.
* **`CounterexampleRole`** — a witness that **refutes** a universally quantified claim in the theory.
* **`DerivationRole`** — a lemma or intermediary derivation establishing a dependency in the proof spine.
* **`EquiconsistencyEvidenceRole`** — a metaproof establishing equiconsistency or relative strength, often used to **constrain** theory choice.

**Semantics.** In a fixed theory version, these roles are **boolean** and **non‑decaying**. If the axiom base or definitions change, the binding must be re‑issued for the new version; there is no silent carry‑over.

**5.2 Experimental line (empirical, inductive, and model‑selection)**

* **`ObservationEvidenceRole`** — raw or processed observations under a declared method.
* **`MeasurementEvidenceRole`** — calibrated measurements with an error model and traceability.
* **`ModelFitEvidenceRole`** — comparative fit or likelihood of data to competing models; supports one **over** another within the declared scope.
* **`ReplicationEvidenceRole`** — independent replication status (full, partial, failed).
* **`CalibrationEvidenceRole`** — evidence about the measurement chain (instrument validity), typically **constraining** claims.
* **`BenchmarkEvidenceRole`** — standardised tasks or suites producing comparable scores.

**Semantics.** Experimental roles require a **claim‑scope** and a **relevance timespan**. Their contribution to confidence is **graded** and may **decay**; the same artefact may carry multiple bindings for different claims or scopes (distinct role assignments).

> **Specialisation, not stacking.** Do not build chains like “transformer‑agent‑observer role.” A system enacts behavioural roles (e.g., `TransformerRole`) to **perform work**; an episteme enacts `U.EvidenceRole` to **classify** its evidential function. Keep enactment lines separate.

### 6 · Clear distinctions (Strict Distinction, litmus tests)

| If you are talking about…               | Use in FPF                                                    | Why                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Who acted and consumed resources**    | `U.System` with `U.RoleAssignment` performing `U.Work`           | Only systems act; work records resource deltas.                       |
| **What was promised to a consumer**     | `U.Service` (promise with access and acceptance)              | A promise is not evidence; it is judged from work.                    |
| **How work should be done or invoked**  | `U.Method` / `U.MethodDescription`                                   | Recipes and interfaces are not evidence.                              |
| **What counts as evidence for a claim** | `U.Episteme` holding `U.EvidenceRole` via `U.RoleAssignment`     | Evidence is a status of an artefact relative to a claim in a context. |
| **Moving meaning across contexts**      | An explicit bridge/alignment pattern in the receiving context | Role meanings are context‑local by design.                            |

### 7 · Core invariants (concept level)

1. 1. **Holder type.** `U.EvidenceRole` is held by a **`U.Episteme`** only; never by a system, work, method, or service.  # [M‑0]
2. **Context anchor.** Every binding **must** name a `U.BoundedContext`; meaning is local and does not propagate implicitly.
3. **Target claim.** Every binding **must** reference a resolvable claim or theory statement and declare **polarity** `{supports | refutes | constrains | neutral}`.
4. **Claim‑scope.** Every binding **must** declare an applicability scope; for the axiomatic line this can be the theory’s domain.
5. **Timespan.** Every binding **must** declare a relevance interval. Axiomatic roles may be open‑ended **for a fixed theory version**; experimental roles require finite or refreshable windows.  **Gating:** narrative only at **M‑0**; explicit `timespan` & `decayClass` at **M‑2**; version fence & `proofChecks` at **F‑***.  # [M/F]
6. **Non‑self‑evidence.** The provenance of experimental bindings **must** trace to external `U.Work` performed by systems under roles; an episteme cannot “evidence itself.”
7. **No mixing of stances.** Do not mix design‑time proof artefacts and run‑time traces in one provenance chain; relate them via separate bindings if needed.
8. +8. **No role mereology.** Roles have **no parts**; refine by **specialisation** only. This prevents confusing “sub‑role” with “subsystem”.   **Profile note:** The constraint is universal (applies to **all profiles**).  # [all]

**Minimal readable grammar (informative).**  
`<Episteme>#<EvidenceRole>:<Context>` — where `<EvidenceRole>` is **defined inside `<Context>`** with normative facets (`claimRef`, `claimScope`, `polarity`, optional `weightModelRef`, decay policy).

**Binding:**  
`Lemma-12.proof#AxiomaticProofRole:GraphTheory`

### 8 · Facets and semantics (normative)

This section deepens the definition of `U.EvidenceRole` by specifying **which normative facets** are attached to its definition within a `U.BoundedContext`, **how decay is handled**, **what provenance anchors are required**, and **how the role contributes to assurance computation**.

#### 8.1 Claim-scope schema

Every `U.EvidenceRole` definition **within a `U.BoundedContext`** **MUST** declare a claim-scope record. This record ties the role’s meaning to the exact target claim and its claim scope, and aligns with the typed-claim form used in B.3:

| Field           | Meaning                            | Norms                                                                                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `claimRef`      | Identifier of the supported claim  | MUST resolve within the context’s claim graph; dangling IDs forbidden.                              |
| `claimHost`     | The holon whose claim is supported | MAY be `U.System` or `U.Episteme`.                                                                  |
| `epistemicMode` | `formal` or `postulative`          | MUST be present; governs stability and decay rules.                                                 |
| `assuranceUse`  | `TA` / `VA` / `LA`                 | Declares whether the evidence functions as typing, verification, or validation input (B.3.3).       |
| `applicability` | Domain subset (envelope)           | Optional for formal proofs; REQUIRED for empirical evidence (units, constraints, parameter ranges). |
| `resultKind`    | Kind of content on the carrier     | Examples: theorem/proof obligation; dataset; calibration; model-fit result.                         |
| `notes`         | Additional context                 | Pointers to SCR/RSCR entries; congruence rationale; bridge IDs if imported from another context.    |

#### 8.2 Timespan and decay

Evidence is perishable unless proven otherwise.

* **Formal (axiomatic) roles** MAY have open-ended `timespan.to = null` **only** if fenced to a specific `U.TheoryVersion` and justified in `notes`.
* **Empirical roles** MUST have a finite or refreshable `timespan`. Decay parameters (half-life, renewal window) are set by the context policy and referenced in the role definition.

When the relevance window closes (`validUntil` reached), the evidence incurs **Epistemic Debt (ED)**. Per B.3.4, debt must trigger one of three managed actions:

1. **Refresh** — new work produces fresh evidence for the same claim and scope.
2. **Deprecate** — role is retired; claim support is reduced or removed.
3. **Waive** — explicit steward decision to accept the stale evidence temporarily.

#### 8.3 Provenance hooks

Each `U.EvidenceRole` **MUST** anchor into the **Evidence–Provenance DAG** (A.10):

* **Formal**: `verifiedBy` → proof artefact carrier(s), with optional `checkedBy` metadata for proof-checker runs.
* **Empirical**: `validatedBy` → data carriers from observed `U.Work` runs; `protocolRef` → `U.MethodDescription`; `fromWorkSet` → IDs of those runs.
* SCR/RSCR anchors (A.10) are mandatory for all carriers.

**No self-evidence rule**: the producing `U.Work` must have been performed by a system in an **external** role; an episteme cannot “prove itself” without independent generation.

#### 8.4 Contribution to assurance

A `U.EvidenceRole` classifies an artefact; its contribution to the target claim’s assurance tuple ⟨F, G, R⟩ is computed in B.3 using:

* **F (formality)** — lower-bounded by the least formal constituent in the provenance path.
* **G (ClaimScope)** — limited to the claim scope; unsupported regions are dropped (WLNK).
* **R (reliability)** — computed as:

```
R_eff := max(0, min_path( min_claimR(path) − Φ(CL_min(path)) ))
```

Here:

* `min_claimR(path)` is the smallest justified reliability along the path from the role to the claim in the context’s support graph.
* `CL_min(path)` is the lowest congruence level on that path.
* `Φ` is the penalty function defined by the context policy; it must be monotonic (lower CL → greater penalty).

If any element in the support chain is `postulative`, the aggregate `epistemicMode` is `postulative`.

**TA/VA/LA distinctions**:

* **TA (Typing assurance)** — primary effect is to improve `CL` on edges, reducing penalties in R computation.
* **VA (Verification assurance)** — primarily raises F and the logical component of R.
* **LA (Validation assurance)** — raises empirical R and constrains G to the validated envelope.

### 9 · Worked examples

#### 9.1 Formal line — *Proof as evidence for a theorem*

**Role definition (in `GraphTheory`)**  
`AxiomaticProofRole`  
- `claimRef = Theorem-12` (“Every finite acyclic graph admits a topological ordering”),  
- `claimScope = all finite DAG`,  
- `polarity = supports` (entails),  
- `epistemicMode = formal`, `assuranceUse = VA`,  
- fenced to `TheoryVersion = 3.1` (open-ended relevance as long as that version stands).

**Binding(s)**  
`Lemma-12.proof#AxiomaticProofRole:GraphTheory`

**Provenance sketch**  
`verifiedBy → Carrier#Proof_p1` (machine-checked), `usedCarrier → Carrier#Def_graph`.

**Effect on assurance (informative)**  
High **F** (machine-checked proof), **G** = “finite DAG”, **R** from proof-obligation integrity; potential CL penalty if an ontology bridge is used.

##### 9.2 Empirical line — *Sensor calibration as evidence for an accuracy claim*

**Role definition (in `Cardio_2026`)**  
`ModelFitEvidenceRole`  
- `claimRef = “Sensor S achieves ±0.3 °C accuracy in [0,70] °C under lab conditions L”`,  
- `claimScope = temperature [0,70] °C; humidity 30–50%; environment L`,  
- `polarity = supports`,  
- `epistemicMode = postulative`, `assuranceUse = LA`,  
- `weightModelRef = KD:SupportMeasure`, `decayPolicy = annual recalibration`.

**Binding(s)**  
`Trial-R3.csv#ModelFitEvidenceRole:Cardio_2026`

**Provenance sketch**  
`validatedBy → Carrier#Dataset_calib_v5`, `protocolRef → MethodDescription#ThermoCalibration`, `fromWorkSet → {cal_run_0502, cal_run_0503}`.

**Effect on assurance (informative)**  
**F** from formalised procedure, **G** = measured envelope, **R** from replication and CL on unit mapping; **R** decays after the policy window unless refreshed.

### 10 · Conformance checklist (normative)

**CC-ER-01 (Type & holder)**
`U.EvidenceRole` **MUST** be held by a `U.Episteme` via `U.RoleAssignment`. Systems, services, methods, or works **MUST NOT** hold this role.

**CC-ER-02 (Context)**
Every binding **MUST** name a `U.BoundedContext`. Role meanings are local and do not propagate without an explicit bridge.

**CC-ER-03 (Target claim)**
Every binding **MUST** reference a resolvable `claimRef@version` and declare `polarity ∈ {supports | refutes | constrains | neutral}`.

**CC-ER-04 (Claim-scope)**
Every binding **MUST** declare `claimScope`. For formal proofs this may be the theory’s domain; for empirical evidence it is mandatory to state population, environment, and parameter envelope.

**CC-ER-05 (Timespan)**
Every binding **MUST** carry a non-empty `timespan`. Formal line may have open-end **only** if fenced to a fixed theory version; empirical line must have a finite or refreshable end.

**CC-ER-06 (Provenance)**
Every binding **MUST** anchor into the EPV-DAG (A.10). For empirical line, `fromWorkSet` must point to external `U.Work`; self-evidence is prohibited.

**CC-ER-07 (Reproducibility)**
Empirical bindings **MUST** state `reproducibility` ∈ {replicated-independent, replicated-internal, not-replicated, irreproducible}, with references where applicable.

**CC-ER-08 (Weight discipline)**
If `weight.score` is present, `weight.modelRef` **MUST** be named and all required inputs supplied.

**CC-ER-09 (Cross-context)**
Cross-context reuse **MUST** go via `U.Alignment` bridge; record `CL_min` on the path for assurance penalties.

**CC-ER-10 (Version fences)**
If the claim or episteme versions, create a new binding; do not mutate in place.

**CC-ER-11 (No role-of-role)**
Roles never hold roles; there is no chaining of behavioural sub-roles into non-behavioural ones.

**CC-ER-12 (Terminology)**
Use *specialisation* for role refinements; reserve *sub* for mereology of systems or artefacts only.

**CC-ER-13 (Lane declaration)**
Every binding **SHALL** declare `assuranceUse ∈ {TA | VA | LA}` and, for **empirical** (LA) bindings, expose `timespan/valid_until` and `decayPolicy` so that SCR can report lane‑separated contributions and freshness (B.3).

### 11 · Anti-patterns and remedies

| Anti-pattern                | Symptom                                                | Remedy                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data speaks for itself**  | Binding with no `context` or `claimRef`.               | Anchor to context and explicit claim; set polarity and timespan.        |
| **Evidence = the work run** | Treating `U.Work` as the episteme.                     | Keep factual record on `U.Work`; create a report episteme to bind.      |
| **Attach to system**        | Holder is `U.System`.                                  | Holder must be an episteme; system may be `claimHost`, not role holder. |
| **Global evidence**         | Using one binding across contexts with no bridge.      | Create explicit `U.Alignment` bridge; declare loss policy.              |
| **Ad-hoc weight**           | Number assigned with no declared model.                | Use context-declared model; supply required inputs.                     |
| **Service proves itself**   | Service KPI logged as evidence.                        | KPIs come from `U.Work`; service evaluation can be bound as evidence.   |
| **Scope blur**              | Mixing design-time and run-time provenance in one EPV. | Split into separate bindings; relate via claim graph or bridge.         |

### 12 · Operators (conceptual, tooling-agnostic)

These operators extend E.6.1 citation graph capabilities for evidence analysis inside a `U.BoundedContext`:

**12.1 Per-claim evidence**
`evidenceFor(claim, t?) → Set[EvidenceRoleAssigning]`
`counterEvidenceFor(claim, t?) → Set[EvidenceRoleAssigning]`
`weight(claim, t?, model?) → score`   # returns **ordinal** at M‑mode; **numeric** at M‑2/F‑mode.  # [M/F]

**12.2 Decay and windows**
`window(claim, [t0,t1])` — filter bindings by `timespan`.
`decayedWeight(binding, t)` — apply context decay policy.

**12.3 Replication and provenance**
`replicationLedger(binding) → Ledger`
`isIndependentReplication(binding) → boolean`

**12.4 Formal line hooks**
`proofChecks(binding) → {assistant, status, hash, kind∈{classical, constructive}}`  # [F‑*]
`dependsOnAxioms(binding) → Set[AxiomId]`

**12.5 Empirical line hooks**
`fromWorkSet(binding) → Set[WorkId]`
`protocol(binding) → MethodDescriptionId`

---

### 13 · Relations

**Builds on:**
A.2 `U.Role`, A.2.1 `U.RoleAssignment` (role as mask, binding as assignment), A.10 Evidence Anchoring (EPV-DAG), B.3 Trust & Assurance Calculus.

**Coordinates with:**
A.3.2 `U.MethodDescription` (protocols, proof obligations), E.6.1 Epistemic Roles via `U.RoleAssignment` (didactic gateway).

**Informs:**
KD-CAL (knowledge dynamics, assurance cases), Norm-CAL (policy claims with evidence), planned `U.ServiceEvaluation` (services judged from work and reported as epistemes with evidence bindings).

---

### 14 · Migration notes (quick wins)

1. **Enumerate claims**: For each evidence collection, identify claims and create explicit bindings with polarity.
2. **Separate work from reports**: Facts stay on `U.Work`; create report epistemes to bind as evidence.
3. **Name the calculus**: Replace free-form confidence with context-declared weight model and required inputs.
4. **Fence by version/time**: Bindings carry `timespan` and version fences; add decay class if applicable.
5. **Bridge explicitly**: Cross-context evidence goes through `U.Alignment`, not by fiat.

### 15 · Didactic quick cards (engineer-manager ready)

These are short reminders for non-specialist readers to apply `U.EvidenceRole` correctly:

* **Evidence ≠ Work** — Work is *what happened*; Evidence is a *documented argument* (episteme) about a claim in a context.
* **Local, not global** — Evidence binds *in a room* (context). Outside that room, you need a bridge (`U.Alignment`).
* **Two lines of trust** — Formal line: proof artefacts checked in a declared theory version. Empirical line: observations from Work under a declared method. Both are epistemes wearing `U.EvidenceRole`.
* **Services are promises; Work proves** — KPIs are measured from Work; service evaluations can be bound as evidence for policy claims.
* **Specialise, don’t stack** — Use specialisations of `U.EvidenceRole` to refine meaning; never chain behavioural roles into evidence.

### 16 · SCR/RSCR audit stubs (assurance scaffolding)

These stubs allow concept-level validation of bindings, without implying any specific tooling.

**SCR-A2.4-E1 (Binding integrity)**
Assert: `holder` is `U.Episteme`; `context` present; `claimRef` resolves; `timespan` non-empty; provenance anchored to EPV.

**SCR-A2.4-E2 (Weight discipline)**
Assert: if `weight.score` present → `weight.modelRef` present and all required inputs provided; recompute to check.

**SCR-A2.4-E3 (Traceability)**
For empirical bindings: binding → `fromWorkSet` → each `U.Work` has performer `U.RoleAssignment` and timestamps; no missing hops.

**RSCR-A2.4-R1 (Regression on version bump)**
When `claimRef` or holder episteme versions change, ensure **new** bindings are created; no in-place mutation.

**RSCR-A2.4-R2 (Decay check)**
Bindings past `timespan.to` or with expired `decayClass` are flagged for review per context policy.

### 18 · Memory hooks and acceptance cross-checks (informative)

**Memory hook:** *“Evidence binds a **document** to a **claim** in a **Context**, for a **time**, with a **trail**.”*
(document = episteme; claim = scoped thesis; Context = bounded context; time = timespan/decay; trail = provenance)

**Acceptance cross-checks before publishing a binding:**

1. **Holder**: Is it a `U.Episteme`?
2. **Context**: Is the `U.BoundedContext` declared?
3. **Claim**: Does `claimRef` resolve? Is `polarity` set?
4. **Scope**: Is `claimScope` complete? For empirical, are population/env/parameters given?
5. **Timespan**: Is it finite or fenced (formal line)?
6. **Provenance**: Is EPV anchored? Any self-evidence?
7. **Reproducibility**: For empirical, is it declared?
8. **Weight**: If scored, is the model named and inputs complete?
9. **Cross-context**: If imported, is `U.Alignment` bridge in place with CL\_min recorded?
10. **No role-of-role**: Is this role bound directly to an episteme without chaining behavioural roles?

# A.2.5 — U.RoleStateGraph: The Named State Space of a Role \[D]

## 1 · Purpose & scope (why this exists)

A **role** is not only a name; it is a *trajectory of admissible states* that governs when, and under which conditions, a holder of that role may **enact** steps of a `U.MethodDescription`. FPF therefore introduces a first‑class intensional object:

> **`U.RoleStateGraph` (RSG)** — the **finite, named state space** of a **`U.Role` in a given `U.BoundedContext`**, with transitions guarded by conditions over the **Role Characterisation Space (RCS)** and contextual events.

The RSG is the **gate** between *assignment* (`U.RoleAssignment`) and *action* (`U.Work`). A step may be performed **only** when the performer’s assignment is **in an enactable RSG state** at the relevant **Window** (time slice) and this is **proven** by a contemporaneous **StateAssertion** (verdict of `U.Evaluation` against the state’s **Checklist**).

---

## 2 · Problem frame (what goes wrong without an RSG)

1. **Readiness blur.** Teams conflate “has the badge” with “is fit to act now”. Without explicit states (*Ready*, *Calibrated*, *Authorized*, *Suspended*…), enactment checks dissolve into ad‑hoc judgement.
2. **Checklist drift.** Criteria for “ready/approved” live in scattered documents; there is no single conceptual anchor tying them to the role.
3. **Workflow/role confusion.** “State” of a *workflow* (according to workplan) is mistaken for the *state of a role* (eligibility to enact).
4. **Status ≠ enactment.** Epistemic/Normative roles (e.g., *NormativeStandard*, *ApprovedSpecification*) need *statuses* that are **not enactable**, yet are used to gate decisions.
5. **Cross‑context substitution by name.** Labels like *Approved* or *Ready* silently cross contexts with different criteria; the loss is hidden and unaudited.

**Consequences.** Violations of **Strict Distinction (A.7)** and **Didactic Primacy (E.12)**: ambiguous authority to act, unsafe SoD, and non‑reproducible evaluations.

---

## 3 · Core idea (didactic)

Think of a **Role** as a **mask**, and the **RSG** as the **traffic lights for that mask** inside one context of meaning.

* The **nodes** are **named states** (*Ready*, *Degraded*, *Suspended*, *Approved*, *Obsolete*…).
* The **edges** are **transitions** with **guards** (checkable conditions over RCS characteristics and contextual events, e.g., *CalibrationAge ≤ 30d*; *AuthorizationSpeechAct recorded*).
* Each **state** is paired with a **Checklist** (criteria you test to issue a **StateAssertion** for a given **Window**).
* Some states are **enactable = true** (green lights); others are **not enactable** (status lights) and therefore can **gate decisions** but **cannot** directly authorize `U.Work`.

> **One sentence.** **RSG says *when a badge is green*.** The Checklist proves it, the **StateAssertion** records it, and the Method step may proceed.

---

## 4 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **`U.RoleStateGraph` (RSG).** Intensional object *owned by* `(Role, Context)`. Finite set of named **States** and typed **Transitions** with guards.
* **RSG.State.** Intensional **named place**. Properties:

  * `enactable ∈ {true,false}` — whether being in this state authorizes enactment of steps that require this role.
  * `initial?`, `terminal?` — optional markers for lifecycle reasoning.
* **RSG.Transition.** Edge `state_i → state_j` with **Guard** (predicate over RCS characteristics and/or contextual events such as `U.SpeechAct`, `U.Observation`, `U.Evaluation` results).
* **RCS (Role Characterisation Space).** The **characteristic bundle** that characterises this role in this Context (e.g., *CalibrationAge*, *AuthorizationScope*, *FatigueIndex*, *IndependenceFlag*, *EvidenceFreshness*). *(Defined in A.2 Role Taxonomy / RoleDescription.)*
* **State Checklist (description).** A **RoleDescription** component that enumerates **criteria** to test whether a holder can legitimately be treated as **in** a given state for a **Window**. *(Description, not the state itself.)*
* **`U.Evaluation` → StateAssertion (verdict).** The **result** of applying the state’s Checklist to a **concrete holder** at a **time window**, yielding a **verdict** “IN‑STATE(S) @Window” with provenance to observations/evidence.
* **Window.** Temporal interval to which the StateAssertion applies (e.g., `[2025‑05‑01, 2025‑06‑01]`).

> **Strict distinction note.**
>
> * **RSG** and its **States** are **intensionals** (what the role *is allowed to be*).
> * **Checklists** and **StateAssertions** are **descriptions/evaluations** (how we *know* a specific holder *is* in that state now).

---

## 5 · What an RSG is **not** (guardrails)

* **Not a workflow.** RSG transitions do **not** encode task order; they encode **eligibility changes** of the *role*.
* **Not a capability list.** RSG is **authorization/readiness over time**, distinct from `U.Capability` (ability).
* **Not a global status set.** RSG lives **inside one Context**; the label *Ready* in another Context is **a different state** unless bridged (F.9).
* **Not a log.** RSG is not a history. Histories are **StateAssertions** over Windows; **`U.Work`** is the record of enactments.
* **Not a document lifecycle.** Epistemic role RSGs can *look like* document lifecycles, but they remain **role‑status graphs**; the **carrier** lifecycle stays separate (A.7, `U.Carrier`).

---

## 6 · Invariants (preview)

*(Full formal clauses in Part 2/4; listed here for orientation.)*

1. **Locality.** `RSG(Role, Context)` is defined **only** within that `U.BoundedContext`.
2. **Finiteness.** The **State** set is finite and named.
3. **Checklist pairing.** Every State has a **Checklist** in the Role’s **RoleDescription**; every enactable State has **at least one** observable criterion.
4. **Green‑gate discipline.** A Method step requiring `Role` may proceed **only** if a contemporaneous **StateAssertion** exists for an **enactable** State.
5. **No silent Cross‑context reuse.** Cross‑Context reuse requires a **Bridge** with CL and loss notes; local `⊥/≤/⊗` always prevail.

## 7 · Formal structure of an RSG (intensional, context‑local)

> **Definition.** For a given **`U.Role`** in a given **`U.BoundedContext`**, its **`U.RoleStateGraph`** is the tuple
> `RSG(Role, Context) = ⟨S, S_en, T, Guard, init?⟩`, where:

* **`S`** — a **finite set of named States** (`StateName ∈ Tech register`, with a Plain label). Names are **local to `(Role, Context)`**.
* **`S_en ⊆ S`** — the subset of **enactable** states (“green lights”). States in `S \ S_en` are **status‑only** (not enactable).
* **`T ⊆ S × S`** — a set of **typed transitions** `sᵢ → sⱼ`. Transitions are optional; the RSG may be acyclic or cyclic.
* **`Guard`** — for each transition (and optionally for state maintenance), a **predicate over**:

  * the role’s **RCS snapshot** at a **Window** (values on named characteristics; see A.2.3), and
  * **Context events** (e.g., presence of a `U.SpeechAct`, freshness of `U.Observation`, validity of a prior `U.Evaluation`).
* **`init? : S → {true,false}`** — optionally marks **initial** state(s). (Useful for lifecycles; not required for gating.)

**Naming discipline (RSG‑N1…N3).**

1. **RSG‑N1 (Minimal set).** `|S| ≥ 1`. At least **one** state must exist; if **no** state is enactable, the role is **status‑only** in this Context.
2. **RSG‑N2 (Disjoint labels).** State names are **unique** within `(Role, Context)`; reusing global labels (e.g., “Ready”) across contexts is allowed **only** via Bridges (F.9).
3. **RSG‑N3 (Human scale).** For didactics, **≤ 7 states** is the default target; exceeding it requires a one‑sentence rationale (“distinct gate we will actually use”).

---

## 8 · Enactability & Checklist semantics (how a state is *known*, now)

An RSG **does not** determine history; it determines **what counts as being in a state**, and which states **authorize enactment**.

### 8.1 State Checklists (description, not the state)

For each `s ∈ S`, the **RoleDescription** (A.2.3) includes a **State Checklist** `Checklist(s)` — a **named set of criteria** that can be evaluated at a **Window** to test “**holder is in state `s`**”.

* **Criterion kinds (illustrative):**

  * **Threshold over RCS characteristic:** `CalibrationAge ≤ 30 days`.
  * **Presence of act:** `AuthorizationSpeechAct exists within 90 days`.
  * **Evidence freshness:** `Evidence(type=SafetyTest).age ≤ 12 months`.
  * **SoD flag:** `IndependenceFlag = true`.
  * **External status:** `StandardStatus = Approved`.

> **Strict distinction.** `Checklist(s)` is a **description**; the **state** `s` is an **intensional place** in the role’s RSG.

### 8.2 From Checklist to **StateAssertion** (verdict of `U.Evaluation`)

Evaluating `Checklist(s)` at a **Window** produces an **`U.Evaluation` verdict**:

> **`StateAssertion(holder, Role, Context, s, Window)`** — “*For this Window, this holder **is** in state `s`*”, with provenance to the actual observations/evidence.

**Rules (RSG‑C1…C5).**

* **RSG‑C1 (All‑must‑hold).** A `StateAssertion` **MUST** justify that **all required criteria** in `Checklist(s)` hold at the Window.
* **RSG‑C2 (Window freshness).** Each criterion **MUST** define its freshness window; if omitted, default is **instantaneous** at the Window’s end time.
* **RSG‑C3 (No guess).** Pure opinion is disallowed; every criterion is grounded in **observable facts** (`U.Observation`, `U.Work` record, `U.SpeechAct`, or a derived `U.Evaluation`).
* **RSG‑C4 (Non‑monotonic over time).** A `StateAssertion` is **not** permanent; once the Window ends, a new evaluation is needed unless a **maintenance guard** keeps it valid (see 8.3).
* **RSG‑C5 (Uniqueness not required).** Multiple states may be asserted for the same Window if their criteria do not conflict (e.g., `Ready` and `Authorized`). **Enactability** is governed by §8.4.

### 8.3 Transitions & guards (admission, maintenance, exit)

RSG transitions **express how eligibility changes** when guards fire. Guards are **predicates**; the RSG stays **notation‑neutral**.

* **Admission guard (`→ s`)** declares **conditions to enter** state `s`.
* **Maintenance guard (`s ↺`)** must hold to **remain** in `s` (e.g., *FatigueIndex < 0.8*, checked every shift).
* **Exit guard (`s →`)** declares **conditions to leave** `s` (e.g., *CalibrationAge > 30d*).

**Rules (RSG‑G1…G3).**

* **RSG‑G1 (Checklists vs guards).** Checklists decide **recognition** (“am I in `s` now?”). Guards describe **change** (“what moves me in/out of `s`?”). They may reuse the **same predicates**; their roles are distinct.
* **RSG‑G2 (No control‑flow).** Guards may refer to **events** (e.g., “Calibration completed”), but RSG is **not a task graph**; it does not prescribe task order.
* **RSG‑G3 (Observable basis).** Every guard references **observable** RCS characteristics or recorded events (no hidden timers).

### 8.4 The **Green‑Gate Law** (enactment gating)

> **Law (RSG‑E1).** A `U.MethodDescription` step that **requires** role `R` **may be enacted** at Window `W` **iff** there exists a `StateAssertion(holder, R, Context, s, W)` with `s ∈ S_en`.

Corollaries:

* **RSG‑E2 (Specialization lift).** If the step requires a **general role** `R`, and the holder has a `StateAssertion` for a **specialist role** `R' ≤ R` in an **enactable** state whose **lift** (see §9.1) is enactable for `R`, the gate passes.
* **RSG‑E3 (Bundle gate).** If the step requires a **bundle** `R* = R₁ ⊗ … ⊗ Rₙ`, enactment requires **n distinct `StateAssertions`** meeting RSG‑E1 for each `Rᵢ` (unless the Context defines a **CompositeRole** with its own RSG; see §9.3).
* **RSG‑E4 (Status‑only roles).** Roles with `S_en = ∅` can **never** authorize enactment; they may **gate decisions** (e.g., *ApprovedSpecRole*) but not `U.Work`.

---

## 9 · Interaction with role algebra (`≤`, `⊥`, `⊗`) and refinement

### 9.1 Specialization (`≤`) — RSG refinement map

When **`R' ≤ R`** (Specialist role refines General role) **in the same Context**, their RSGs **must align** by a **refinement map**.

> **Rule (RSG‑R1 Refinement).** There exists a **surjective mapping**
> `π : S(R') → S(R)` such that:
>
> 1. **Enactability preservation:** `s' ∈ S_en(R') ⇒ π(s') ∈ S_en(R)`.
> 2. **Checklist entailment:** `Checklist_R'(s') ⇒ Checklist_R(π(s'))` (each specialist state’s criteria **imply** the general state’s criteria).
> 3. **Guard monotonicity (informal):** Transitions in `R'` **do not weaken** the general readiness implied by `R` (entering/exiting patterns respect π).

**Interpretation.** Being in `s'` for `R'` *guarantees* being in `π(s')` for `R`. Thus **StateAssertions lift** along π, enabling **RSG‑E2**.

**Design note.** RCS for `R'` may **extend** that of `R`; specialist states can be **stricter** (more criteria) but not **looser** than their general counterparts.

### 9.2 Incompatibility (`⊥`) — state‑aware SoD

`R_A ⊥ R_B` (within the same Context) states that **a single holder** **must not** have **overlapping, enactable authority** for both roles.

> **Rule (RSG‑I1).** At **Window `W`**, a holder **violates** `R_A ⊥ R_B` iff there exist **StateAssertions**
> `… in s_A ∈ S_en(R_A)` **and** `… in s_B ∈ S_en(R_B)` **both valid at `W`**.

**Optional refinement (soft ⊥).** Contexts **may** tighten incompatibility by listing **state pairs** that are forbidden (e.g., `Ready_A ⊥ Authorized_B`), while allowing benign combinations (e.g., `Suspended_A` + `Ready_B`). By default, **any** enactable pair conflicts.

**Didactic payoff.** SoD is checked by **states in Windows**, not by static role labels.

### 9.3 Bundles (`⊗`) — conjunction without product explosion

A **bundle role** `R* := R₁ ⊗ … ⊗ Rₙ` expresses “**must wear all these badges at once**”.

> **Rule (RSG‑B1).** If `R*` exists **only as a requirement macro**, **do not** construct a product RSG. The **gate** for a step requiring `R*` is satisfied by **n separate StateAssertions** `sᵢ ∈ S_en(Rᵢ)` at the same Window.

> **Rule (RSG‑B2 CompositeRole).** If the Context **declares `R*` as a first‑class `U.Role`**, it **MUST** also specify an `RSG(R*)` and an embedding `ιᵢ : S(R*) → S(Rᵢ)` that **preserves enactability**; being in an enactable state of `R*` **implies** being enactable in each `Rᵢ`.

**Rationale.** Avoid combinatorial blow‑up by default; allow a composite role **only** when the organization genuinely maintains its **own** readiness graph.

### 9.4 Readiness monotonicity across specialization & bundles

* **RSG‑M1 (Specialist suffices).** If a step requires `R`, any `R' ≤ R` whose **lifted state** is enactable **suffices**.
* **RSG‑M2 (Bundle conjunctivity).** If a step requires `R₁ ⊗ R₂`, the performer must produce **both** gates (two StateAssertions), unless a CompositeRole with RSG exists and is used.

---

## 10 · Guard design (types and discipline)

To keep RSGs **operational** but **not procedural**, guards draw on **observable** inputs only.

**Guard types (non‑exhaustive).**

1. **Threshold guards** over RCS characteristics
   `FatigueIndex < 0.8`, `CalibrationAge ≤ 30d`, `EvidenceFreshness(role=Tester) ≤ 90d`.
2. **Event guards** (occurrence since last Window)
   `exists SpeechAct(type=Authorization)`, `exists Evaluation(verdict=Pass, checklist=SafetyKit)`.
3. **Temporal guards** (time within range)
   `now ∈ AuthorizationValidityWindow`, `MaintenanceWindow not active`.
4. **Relational guards**
   `IndependenceFrom(holder=X) = true` (for SoD), `NoOpenIncident(severity≥High)`.

**Rules (RSG‑G4…G6).**

* **RSG‑G4 (Observable only).** Each guard **MUST** be checkable from **observable artefacts** (observations, work logs, speech acts, evaluations) or present RCS values.
* **RSG‑G5 (Context‑local semantics).** Guard semantics are **scoped to Context**; Cross‑context reuse requires a Bridge (§14 in Part 1/4, F.9).
* **RSG‑G6 (Didactic sparseness).** Prefer **few, stable guards** over many brittle micro‑conditions. If a guard encodes **task order**, you are drifting into workflow; refactor back to eligibility.

Allowed guard evidences include:
* Observation facts (measurements/metrics),
* Evaluation verdicts (checklist results),
* SpeechAct occurrences (communicative `U.Work`), identified by role, act kind, and window (e.g., “Approved(change=4711)”).

A SpeechAct can change the state (e.g., Prepared→Authorized) but does not by itself satisfy operational steps; it only opens their Green‑Gate.

## 11 · Putting it together (one‑screen mental model)

At any **Window**:

1. **RoleAssignment exists** (A.2.1): `Holder#Role:Context`.
2. **StateAssertion(s) exist**: the holder is **in** one or more **states** as proven by checklists (`U.Evaluation`).
3. **Green‑Gate Law** applies: if at least one asserted state is **enactable**, role‑gated **Method steps** may be enacted; if all are **status‑only**, the role can **gate decisions** but **not** perform work.
4. **Role algebra** checks: specialization lifts readiness; bundles require **conjunction**; incompatibilities are detected when **two enactable states** coincide for the same holder at the same Window.

This yields a **clean separation**:

* **assignment** (RoleAssignment)
* **Readiness** (RSG + Checklists + StateAssertions)
* **Action** (`U.Work`, gated by RSG)

…and keeps meaning **local**, evidence **observable**, and reasoning **testable**.

## 12 · Archetypal RoleStateGraphs (cross‑domain patterns)

Below are **didactic, reusable** RSG skeletons for the three principal **behavioural** role families and for **epistemic/status** roles. Names and criteria are **context‑local**; treat them as **templates** to specialise inside your `U.BoundedContext` (E.10.D1). For each RSG we list:

* **`S`** — candidate **States** (enactable states marked **\[E]**);
* **Checklist gist** — the **recognition** criteria (cf. §8.1);
* **Guards** — illustrative **admission/maintenance/exit** predicates (cf. §8.3).

> **Reminder.** Only **enactable** states (**`S_en`**) can open the **Green‑Gate** for `U.Work` (RSG‑E1). Status‑only states **gate decisions** but never execution.

### 12.1 AgentialRole (decision‑capable actor)

**Context sketch:** `Ops_ChangeManagement_2025`.
**RCS (characteristics, examples):** *CompetenceLevel, FatigueIndex, IndependenceFlag, AuthorizationValidity, IncidentLoad, RiskClass.*

**States `S`**

* **Unprepared** — training incomplete; checklists fail.
* **Prepared** — training + competence thresholds met.
* **Authorized** — valid approval window present. **\[E]**
* **Ready** — `Prepared ∧ Authorized ∧ FatigueIndex < τ`. **\[E]**
* **Active** — contemporaneous **`U.Work`** step is underway under this role (**with a valid StateAssertion in the window**). **\[E]**
* **Suspended** — temporary block (incident/conflict).
* **Revoked** — authorization expired/withdrawn.

**Checklist gist**

* *Prepared*: certificates valid; recency of practice ≤ X; simulator score ≥ Y.
* *Authorized*: `exists SpeechAct(type=Approval, scope=Role, age≤30d)`.
* *Ready*: *Prepared ∧ Authorized ∧* independence from conflicting work; fatigue within limits.

**Guards**

* Admission `→ Prepared`: `ExamPassed ∧ SimulatorScore≥Y`.
* Admission `→ Authorized`: presence of approval speech‑act within window.
* Maintenance `Ready ↺`: `FatigueIndex<τ ∧ IncidentLoad≤k`.
* Exit `Ready → Suspended`: high‑severity incident assigned OR SoD violation detected.
* Exit `Authorized → Revoked`: window elapsed or explicit revoke speech‑act.

### 12.2 TransformerRole (non‑agential executor of change)

**Context sketch:** `PlantOps_Pipeline_2025`.
**RCS:** *CalibrationAge, SafetyInterlock, SelfTestPass, EnvRangeOK, DegradationIndex.*

**States `S`**

* **Unavailable** — offline, missing prerequisites.
* **Calibrated** — calibration fresh; self‑test ok.
* **Permitted** — safety interlocks clear; clearance token valid.
* **Ready** — `Calibrated ∧ Permitted ∧ EnvRangeOK`. **\[E]**
* **Running** — executing a method step (**with contemporaneous StateAssertion**). **\[E]**
* **Degraded** — still operable under derated envelope. **\[E]** (if policy allows)
* **Quarantined** — suspected hazard; no enactment.

**Checklist gist**

* *Calibrated*: `CalibrationAge≤30d ∧ SelfTestPass=true`.
* *Permitted*: `SafetyInterlock = Clear ∧ NoOpenIncident(sev≥High)`.
* *Ready*: *Calibrated ∧ Permitted ∧* environment in spec.

**Guards**

* Admission `→ Calibrated`: calibration record timestamp ≤30d.
* Maintenance `Ready ↺`: env sensors within limits; no new hazard event.
* Exit `Ready → Quarantined`: detected leak OR hazard alarm.
* Transition `Running → Ready`: step completed ∧ cool‑down satisfied.
* Transition `Ready → Degraded`: `DegradationIndex∈[d₁,d₂]` ∧ derate policy active.

### 12.3 ObserverRole (measurement actor, incl. SOSA/SSN style)

**Context sketch:** `Lab_Thermo_2025`.
**RCS:** *CalibrationAge, TraceabilityChainOK, DriftRate, SyncError, CleanlinessScore.*

**States `S`**

* **Unqualified** — no metrological chain.
* **Calibrated** — with traceability to standard.
* **Synchronized** — time/phase sync within tolerance.
* **In‑Range** — drift & environment within spec.
* **Measuring** — performing observation. **\[E]**
* **Stale** — calibration or sync expired.
* **Quarantined** — suspect bias/contamination.

**Checklist gist**

* *Calibrated*: traceability cert valid; calibration within period.
* *Synchronized*: `SyncError≤ε`.
* *In‑Range*: drift ≤ threshold; contamination tests passed.
* *Measuring*: *Calibrated ∧ Synchronized ∧ In‑Range* AND observation procedure active.

**Guards**

* Admission `→ Calibrated`: calibration event recorded < 180d.
* Exit `Calibrated → Stale`: calibration age > threshold.
* Exit `In‑Range → Quarantined`: contamination alert OR failed control sample.
* Transition `Measuring → In‑Range`: procedure complete.

> **Note.** Many ObserverRole states are **pre‑enactment** gates; only **Measuring** is enactable.

---

### 12.4 Epistemic/status roles (no enactment)

These roles are **status‑only**; **`S_en = ∅`**. They **gate decisions** (e.g., can be cited, can constrain), but can never authorize `U.Work`.

#### 12.4.1 NormativeStandardRole

**States:** *Draft*, *Candidate*, *Approved*, *Superseded*, *Deprecated*.
**Checklist gist:** governance decision records; publication identifiers; supersession links.
**Guards:** *Approved → Superseded* on adoption of newer edition; *Candidate → Approved* after ratification vote.

#### 12.4.2 EvidenceRole

**States:** *Collected*, *Verified*, *Validated*, *Obsolete*, *Contested*.
**Checklist gist:** verification/validation `U.Evaluation` present; freshness window; reproducibility tag.
**Guards:** decay to *Obsolete* by age; transition to *Contested* upon counter‑evidence.

#### 12.4.3 RequirementRole

**States:** *Proposed*, *Accepted*, *Implemented*, *Verified*, *Waived*.
**Checklist gist:** acceptance decision; trace links to `U.Work`; verification report; waiver authorization.
**Guards:** *Accepted → Implemented* when linked executions close; *Implemented → Verified* on passed acceptance checklist; *Any → Waived* by authorized speech‑act.

---

## 13 · One‑screen authoring templates (didactic cards)

Keep each RSG **teachable on one screen**. Use the following **notation‑neutral** templates when drafting RoleDescriptions (A.2.3).

### 13.1 RSG card (per Role, per Context)

```
RSG for: <RoleName>   Context: <ContextName/Edition>
RCS characteristics (gist): <characteristic1>, <characteristic2>, ...
States (◉ = enactable):
  - [◉] <StateName> — checklist gist; typical admission/maintenance/exit
  - [  ] <StateName> — ...
  - ...
Green‑Gate: step requiring <RoleName> is enactable iff holder asserts any ◉ state at Window.
Role algebra hooks: specialization (≤ ...), incompatibility (⊥ ...), bundles (⊗ ...).
```

### 13.2 State checklist snippet (per State)

```
State <StateName> (enactable? yes/no)
Checklist (all must hold at Window):
  - <Observable criterion 1>  (e.g., CalibrationAge ≤ 30d)
  - <Observable criterion 2>  (e.g., exists SpeechAct(Approval) age ≤ 30d)
Maintenance (optional): <predicate> (e.g., EnvRangeOK)
Evidence anchors: <Observation/Evaluation ids>
```

### 13.3 Specialization refinement map (R' ≤ R)

```
Refinement map π : S(R') → S(R)
R' state        π(state in R)   entailment note (why Checklist_R' ⇒ Checklist_R)
-----------     -------------    -----------------------------------------------
<Ready+>        Ready            adds stricter fatigue & independence thresholds
<Authorized+>   Authorized       requires same approval + extra duty segregation
...
```

### 13.4 SoD focus (⊥) — enactable pairs

```
Incompatibility ⊥ (applies when both sides enactable at same Window):
  <RoleA.StateX>  ⊥  <RoleB.StateY>
  <RoleA.(any ◉)> ⊥  <RoleB.(any ◉)>   // default if not refined
Rationale: <one‑line reason>
```

> **Didactic cue.** If your “template” spills beyond a screen, you’re drifting into **workflow**. Pull back to **eligibility** (RSG) and **recognition** (checklists).

---

## 14 · Cross‑context adjustments (via Bridges, not imports)

RSGs are **context‑local**. When similar roles appear in different Contexts, relate them with an **Alignment Bridge** (F.9), never by silently importing state names.

### 14.1 State name correspondence (lossy mapping)

**Bridge example:** *Observer readiness* across two contexts:

```
Bridge: Observer-RSG alignment
From: Lab_Thermo_2025.ObserverRole
To:   Metrology_Line_2025.ObserverRole
Map (with CL):
  Calibrated(Lab)     ≈  Calibrated(Metro)            CL=3 (minor criterion diffs)
  In‑Range(Lab)       ↘  Fit‑for‑Use(Metro)           CL=2 (Metro adds robustness test)
  Measuring(Lab)      ↔  Measuring(Metro)             CL=3
Notes: 'Synchronized' in Lab maps to 'Time‑Aligned' in Metro (terminology shift).
Losses: Metro’s 'Robustness' has no direct Lab counterpart (explicit loss recorded).
```

**Rule (RSG‑X1).** A Bridge **MUST** record **losses** and **extra criteria**; it **MUST NOT** assert identity without a stated `CL` (congruence level).

### 14.2 Authorization vocabulary drift (deontic vs operational)

**Bridge note:** In some IT change contexts, “**Authorized**” (deontic) overlaps with “**Permitted**” (operational). A Bridge can **explain** the design choice:

* `Authorized(AgentialRole@ITIL)` ↔ `Permitted(TransformerRole@IEC)` with **CL=1** and a note: *operational interlock ≠ managerial approval; both required to lift to Ready under our policy.*

> **Payoff.** Bridges keep **local honesty** while enabling **Cross‑context reasoning** with explicit penalties (B.3).

---

## 15 · Author conformance (write good RSGs)

When you define or revise an RSG, check these **concept‑level** rules. They are easy to hold in mind; no tooling implied.

**CC‑RSG‑01 (Locality).** State names and meanings are **scoped** to `(Role, Context)`. Reuse across contexts **only via a Bridge** (F.9).

**CC‑RSG‑02 (Enactability).** Mark **which** states are enactable (**S\_en**). If none are, the role is **status‑only** (valid); then it **cannot** open the Green‑Gate.

**CC‑RSG‑03 (Observable criteria).** Every checklist item must be **observable** (Observation, Work record, SpeechAct, or derived Evaluation). No opinions.

**CC‑RSG‑04 (Guard discipline).** Guards **gate change**, checklists **recognise state**. Don’t smuggle **task order** into guards; workflow lives elsewhere (A.15).

**CC‑RSG‑05 (Refinement map).** If you declare `R' ≤ R`, provide a **π‑map** and ensure **entailment** (RSG‑R1). Specialist states may be **stricter**, never **weaker**.

**CC‑RSG‑06 (SoD by state).** Define **⊥** in terms of **enactable pairs**. Avoid blanket ⊥ if finer, state‑aware rules reduce false conflicts.

**CC‑RSG‑07 (Human scale).** Default to **≤ 7 states**. If you exceed, add a one‑sentence **didactic rationale** (“distinct gate we will actually use”).

**CC‑RSG‑08 (Green‑Gate wiring).** Ensure every `MethodDescription` step that requires this Role **names** the **◉ states** it expects, or relies on the default “any ◉”.

**CC‑RSG‑09 (Window clarity).** Checklists specify **freshness windows**; state assertions are **Window‑bound** and **non‑permanent**.

**CC‑RSG‑10 (Status/behaviour split).** Epistemic/status roles: **`S_en = ∅`**. They gate **decisions**, not **Work**. Behavioural roles require `U.System` holders (A.2.1).

## 16 · Extended grounding across four disciplines

Each vignette shows **(i)** the **Context**, **Role**, **RCS characteristics**, **States** (◉ = enactable), **Green‑Gate** condition, and **how a `U.Work` is gated** by a `U.RoleAssignment`+RSG. Names are **context‑local**.

### 16.1 Clinical surgery (medicine)

**Context.** `Hospital.OR_2026`
**Role.** `SurgeonRole` (AgentialRole)
**RCS characteristics.** *CompetenceLevel, FatigueIndex, AuthorizationValidity, CaseComplexityBand, TeamSoD*.

**States.**

* **Unprepared** — training/recency incomplete.
* **Prepared** — credentials valid; recency ≤ 90 days.
* **Authorized** — procedure‑specific approval active.
* **Ready** — `Prepared ∧ Authorized ∧ FatigueIndex<τ ∧ TeamSoD_OK`. **◉**
* **Operating** — currently performing steps. **◉**
* **Suspended** — incident or conflict raised.
* **Revoked** — approval expired/withdrawn.

**Green‑Gate.** A `MethodDescription` step tagged `requires: SurgeonRole` is **enactable** iff the performer’s `RoleAssignment` asserts **Ready** at the **Window**.

**Work gating.**
`performedBy = Dr.Kim#SurgeonRole:Hospital.OR_2026` is **valid** for step *“Incision”* only when `Ready(Dr.Kim, SurgeonRole, OR_2026, W)` holds (checklist items: approval id, fatigue score, SoD against *AuditorRole*).

---

### 16.2 Software operations (SRE)

**Context.** `SRE_Prod_Cluster_EU_2026`
**Role.** `IncidentCommanderRole` (AgentialRole)
**RCS characteristics.** *OnCallStatus, PageFreshness, AuthorityToken, CognitiveLoad, ConflictSoD*.

**States.**

* **Off‑Duty** — not on call.
* **On‑Call** — rota active; page reachable.
* **Authorized** — escalation token valid.
* **Ready** — `On‑Call ∧ Authorized ∧ CognitiveLoad≤k ∧ SoD_OK`. **◉**
* **RunningIncident** — commanding an active incident. **◉**
* **CoolingDown** — post‑incident refractory period.
* **Blocked** — conflict with *ChangeAuthorRole* detected.

**Green‑Gate.** Steps in *“Major Incident Process”* that `require: IncidentCommanderRole` open only with **Ready**.

**Work gating.**
`performedBy = Dana#IncidentCommanderRole:SRE_Prod_Cluster_EU_2026` is **invalid** for “Declare SEV‑1” if `ConflictSoD(ChangeAuthorRole)` holds or `PageFreshness>5 min`.

---

### 16.3 Laboratory metrology

**Context.** `Metrology_Thermo_2026`
**Role.** `ThermometerObserverRole` (ObserverRole)
**RCS characteristics.** *CalibrationAge, DriftRate, TraceabilityChainOK, CleanlinessScore, SyncError*.

**States.**

* **Unqualified** — missing traceability.
* **Calibrated** — cert valid (≤ 180 d); drift within baseline.
* **Synchronized** — `SyncError≤ε`.
* **In‑Range** — contamination absent; env OK.
* **Measuring** — procedure active. **◉**
* **Stale** — calibration/sync expired.
* **Quarantined** — suspected bias.

**Green‑Gate.** `MethodDescription` step *“Record temperature”* is enactable only in state **Measuring** (which requires *Calibrated ∧ Synchronized ∧ In‑Range*).

**Work gating.**
`performedBy = SensorT‑17#ThermometerObserverRole:Metrology_Thermo_2026` is **rejected** if `CalibrationAge>180 d` or `ControlSampleBias>δ`.

---

### 16.4 Governance / compliance

**Context.** `Finance_Audit_2026`
**Role.** `IndependentAuditorRole` (AgentialRole) and `EvidenceRole` (status‑only)
**RCS (auditor).** *CertificationLevel, IndependenceFlag, AssignmentToken, CaseLoad*.
**States (auditor).** **Ready**/**Auditing** as in §12.1; **⊥** with `DeveloperRole`.
**RCS (evidence).** *VerificationStatus, ValidationStatus, Age, ProvenanceChainOK*.
**States (evidence).** *Collected, Verified, Validated, Contested, Obsolete* (status‑only).

**Green‑Gate.** Audit step `requires: IndependentAuditorRole` — enactable only with **Ready** and **⊥ DeveloperRole** at the Window. Evidence states **gate decisions** (e.g., “accept finding”), never open Work.

**Work gating.**
`performedBy = Alice#IndependentAuditorRole:Finance_Audit_2026` **fails** if Alice holds any overlapping `DeveloperRole` binding in the same context.

---

## 17 · Acceptance harness (static conformance)

Author‑facing checks; **notation‑free**, **concept‑level**. Use them when drafting or reviewing an RSG.

**SCR‑A.2.5‑S01 · Local scope.** Every state name is qualified by `(Role, Context)`. No global states.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S02 · Enactability mark.** The set **S\_en** is explicit; each ◉ state is listed.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S03 · Observable checklists.** Each state has a Checklist of **observable** predicates (Observation / Evaluation / SpeechAct / Work evidence).
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S04 · Green‑Gate wiring.** Every `MethodDescription` step that names the Role either (a) names its ◉ state(s) or (b) relies on the default “any ◉” policy; the RSG declares which.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S05 · Guard discipline.** Guards only **gate transitions**; they do not encode task order.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S06 · SoD by state.** Incompatibilities (⊥) are declared over **states** (or “any ◉”), not over bare role names.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S07 · Specialisation entailment.** For every `R' ≤ R`, a refinement map `π: S(R')→S(R)` is provided; each mapped pair has an entailment note (why `Checklist_R' ⇒ Checklist_R`).
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S08 · Human scale.** `|S| ≤ 7` unless a one‑line didactic rationale is recorded.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S09 · Status‑only roles.** If `S_en=∅`, the Role is explicitly tagged **status‑only**; it cannot open the Green‑Gate.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S10 · Bridge discipline.** Any cross‑context reuse is via an Alignment Bridge (F.9) with recorded `CL` and losses; no silent imports.

## 18 · Regression harness (evolution checks)

Use when **adding/removing states**, **changing criteria**, or **bridging** across contexts.

**RSCR‑A.2.5‑R01 · State churn impact.** For every added/removed/renamed state, list affected `MethodDescription` steps and `Work` validators; confirm the Green‑Gate policy remains decidable.
**RSCR‑A.2.5‑R02 · Entailment stability.** When `R' ≤ R` changes, update the `π` map and re‑justify entailments; fail the check if any previously valid entailment breaks.
**RSCR‑A.2.5‑R03 · SoD coverage.** After edits, recompute the set of **enactable pairs**; verify declared ⊥ still blocks all intended conflicts and no longer blocks permitted cases.
**RSCR‑A.2.5‑R04 · Evidence freshness.** If any checklist predicate uses **age/freshness**, ensure default Windows are documented and existing state assertions re‑evaluate accordingly.
**RSCR‑A.2.5‑R05 · Bridge congruence drift.** If a Bridge maps states with `CL=k`, and either side’s checklist changes, revisit the mapping; **do not** keep `CL` unchanged by default—raise or lower with a short rationale.
**RSCR‑A.2.5‑R06 · Status/behaviour split.** Verify behavioural roles still require `U.System` holders (A.2.1); status‑only roles still have `S_en=∅`.
**RSCR‑A.2.5‑R07 · One‑screen rule.** If cumulative edits push the RSG beyond one screen, split states or tighten criteria; record a one‑line teaching rationale if you must exceed.

| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workflow creep** | Guards encode task order              | RSG becomes a hidden workflow model | Move ordering to `MethodDescription`; keep guards as **eligibility** only |
| **Vague criteria** | “experienced”, “mature” in checklists | Non‑decidable Green‑Gate           | Replace with observable proxies (hours, exam score, age thresholds)       |
| **Global states**  | “Ready” reused across contexts        | Meaning leakage                    | Qualify by `(Role, Context)`; use Bridges for Cross‑context talk             |
| **Over‑broad ⊥**   | Many false conflicts                  | Blocks delivery                    | Make ⊥ **state‑aware**; restrict to enactable pairs                       |
| **Missing π‑map**  | Specialisation with no entailment     | Unsafe substitutions               | Add `π` and entailment notes; otherwise drop `≤`                          |

## 20 · Didactic script (90 seconds): how A.2.5 ties to A.2.1 & A.2.3

> \*“A role assignment says **who wears which mask where** (A.2.1). The **RoleStateGraph** says **when that mask is actually wearable**. Each role’s RSG is a **small named state space** with **checklists** for each state. Some states are **enactable** (◉): they open the **Green‑Gate** for `Work`. Others are **status‑only**: they gate decisions, never execution.
>
> A **RoleDescription** (A.2.3) is where you publish the role’s **RCS** (characteristics), its **RSG** (states + checklists + guards), and any **role algebra** (≤, ⊥, ⊗) specific to your context.
>
> In practice: a `MethodDescription` step lists **required roles**; at runtime, a `Work` record is valid only if its **performer** is a `RoleAssignment` whose RSG asserts an **enactable** state at the **Window**. That’s the Green‑Gate.
>
> Different Contexts may use the same role labels. We never assume global meaning; we relate Contexts with **Bridges** that map states and record losses.
>
> Keep each RSG **on one screen**, with **observable** checklists. If you’re writing task order, you’ve slipped into workflow—move it to the Method. If you’re writing opinions, convert them into **observables** or drop them. That’s the whole trick.”\*

# A.2.6 · **Unified Scope Mechanism (USM): Context Slices & Scopes**  \[A] 

> **One‑line summary.** Introduces a single, context‑local **scope mechanism** for all holons: **`U.ContextSlice`** (where we reason and measure) and a family of **set‑valued scope characteristics** (**`U.Scope`**), specialized as **`U.ClaimScope`** for epistemes (**G** in **F–G–R**) and **`U.WorkScope`** for system capabilities, with one algebra (∩ / SpanUnion / translate / widen / narrow / refit) and uniform Cross‑context handling (Bridge + CL).

## 0 · Status, Placement & Deprecations

**Status.** Normative pattern \[A] in **Part A · Core Holonic Concepts**. Numbered **A.2.6**.

**Replaces / deprecates.**
This pattern **supersedes** the scattered use of characteristic labels *applicability*, *envelope*, *generality*, and *capability envelope* when they name a scope‑like characteristic. From now on:

* For epistemes, the only scope characteristic is **`U.ClaimScope`** (nick **G** in F–G–R).
* For system capabilities, the only scope characteristic is **`U.WorkScope`**.
* The abstract architectural notion is **`U.Scope`** (the shared set‑valued mechanism).

Legacy words (*applicability / envelope / generality / capability envelope*) MAY appear **only** as explanatory aliases in non‑normative notes.

**Cross‑references.**
— **C.2.3** (Unified Formality **F**) and **C.2.2** (F–G–R): this pattern **defines G** as `U.ClaimScope`.
— **A.2.2** (Capabilities): capability gating now **SHALL** use `U.WorkScope`.
— **Part B** (Bridges & CL): Cross‑context transfers **MUST** declare a Bridge with **CL**; CL affects **R**, not **F/G**.


## 1 · Purpose & Audience

This pattern gives **engineering managers and assurance architects** one vocabulary, one model, and one set of operations to talk about **where** a claim holds and **under which conditions** a system can deliver a piece of **Work**. It removes the need to remember whether a document said “applicability,” a model said “envelope,” or a safety plan said “capability envelope.” **Scope is scope.** The only distinction that matters is **what carries it**:

* **Knowledge/episteme** → **Claim scope** (G).
* **System/capability** → **Work scope** (conditions to execute Work at the promised measures).

With USM, teams can:

* specify, compare, and compose scope **without translation games**;
* gate ESG and Method–Work steps with **observable, context‑local scope checks**;
* cross Contexts safely using Bridges and **explicit CL penalties** applied to **R**.

This pattern **defines** the **scope mechanism** (Context slices, set‑valued scopes, algebra, and guard usage) and the canonical **lexicon** (Claim scope (G), Work scope). It does **not** prescribe which Contexts must widen/narrow scope, nor which assurance levels are required; those are set by context‑local ESG and Method–Work policies, which SHALL reference the mechanisms defined here.

## 2 · Context

### 2.1 Cross‑disciplinary pressures

Modern projects couple **formal specs**, **data‑driven models**, **safety cases**, and **operational playbooks**. Each artifact must say **where it is valid**—yet terminology drifts:

* Standards and specs often say *applicability* or *scope*.
* Modeling communities say *envelope*.
* Safety and performance documents speak about *capability envelope*.
* Knowledge patterns have used *generality* (G) as if it were “more abstract,” when we actually need “**where the statement holds**.”

### 2.2 context‑local reasoning

FPF is context‑local: decisions, checks, and state assertions are **valid inside a bounded context**. Every practical question—*Is this claim usable here? Can this capability deliver that Work now?*—must be answered **on a concrete slice of context** (terminology, versions, environmental parameters, time selector **Γ\_time**). USM provides a first‑class object for such slices and a single scope calculus atop them.

### 2.3 Minimal, composable trust math

In **F–G–R**:

* **F** (formality) is “how strictly a claim is expressed” (C.2.3).
* **G** must be “**where it holds**,” not “how abstract it sounds.”
* **R** measures evidence and decays/penalties (freshness, CL).

When **G** is a **set‑valued scope**, composition becomes precise: serial dependencies **intersect** scopes; parallel, independently supported lines can publish a **SpanUnion**—but only where each line is supported.

---

## 3 · Problem

1. **Synonym soup.** *Applicability, envelope, generality, capability envelope*—different labels for the **same mechanism** led to mismatches in gating, review, and reuse.
2. **Abstraction confusion.** Calling G “generality” invited teams to treat “more abstract wording” as “broader scope,” silently masking unstated assumptions.
3. **Split mechanics.** Episteme vs system text used different algebra and guard language, though **the same set operations** were meant.
4. **Cross‑context opacity.** Transfers between Contexts lacked a shared carrier and a rule for what changes (trust) vs what stays (scope).
5. **Overloaded words.** *Validity* clashed with **Validation Assurance (LA)**; *operation/operational* clashed with **Work/Run** in A.15, producing governance ambiguity.

| **Locality vs interoperability**                  | Scope must be **context‑local** and precisely checkable, yet transferable across Contexts via Bridges **without redefining** the characteristic.                       |
| **Expressivity vs minimal vocabulary**            | Teams need to capture rich conditions (time windows, environment, versions) but not explode the lexicon into “envelope/applicability/…” variants.                |
| **Static content vs operational change**          | Claims may hold broadly while current operations are narrow (or vice versa). The mechanism must keep “what is true” and “what can be done” aligned yet distinct. |
| **Open‑world exploration vs closed‑world gating** | Exploration benefits from permissive drafts; **gates** require crisp, observable checks. The same scope object must support both.                                |

## 5 · Solution — Overview (preview; full definitions in Part 2)

**USM** introduces:

* **`U.ContextSlice`** — an addressable **slice of a bounded context** (terminology, parameter ranges, versions/contracts, and a mandatory **Γ\_time** selector). All scope checks are performed **on slices**.
* **`U.Scope`** — the abstract **set‑valued scope characteristic** over `U.ContextSlice`.
* **Specializations:**
  **`U.ClaimScope`** (*nick **G***) on `U.Episteme` (“**where the claim holds**”), and **`U.WorkScope`** on `U.Capability` (“**where the capability can deliver Work at declared measures within qualification windows**”).
* **One algebra:** serial **intersection**, parallel **SpanUnion** (only where supported), **translate** via Bridge (CL affects **R**, not **F/G**), and **widen / narrow / refit** operations for scope evolution.

**Lexical commitments (normative):**
— In normative text and guards, use **Claim scope (G)** and **Work scope**.
— Do **not** name the characteristic “applicability/envelope/generality/capability envelope/validity.” Those words are permitted only as explanatory aliases in notes.

## 6 · Normative Definitions

### 6.1 · `U.ContextSlice` — where scope is evaluated

**Definition.** `U.ContextSlice` is an addressable, context‑local selection of a bounded context comprising:

* **Vocabulary & roles.** The active terminology, role bindings, and local dictionaries.
* **Contracts & versions.** Concrete versioned interfaces, schemas, notations, or service contracts in force.
* **Environment selectors.** Named parameters/ranges (e.g., temp, humidity, platform, jurisdiction, dataset cohort).
* **Time selector `Γ_time`.** A **mandatory** selector for the temporal frame of reference (point, window, or policy), disallowing implicit “latest”.

**Semantics.** All scope checks, guards, and compositions are evaluated **inside** an explicitly named `U.ContextSlice`. Cross‑context or cross‑slice usage MUST be mediated by a Bridge (Part B) with an explicit CL rating; see §7.4.

**Addressability.** A slice MUST be identifiable via a canonical tuple (Context, vocab‑id, contract/version ids, env selector(s), `Γ_time`). A slice MAY be a singleton or a finite set if a guard tests multiple coherent sub‑conditions. 

**Slice key (minimal).** A `U.ContextSlice` **SHALL** be addressable by a tuple containing at least: `(Context, contract/version ids (if any), environment selectors, Γ_time)`. Contexts MAY extend this tuple (e.g., vocab/roleset ids).

### 6.2 · `U.Scope` — the abstract set‑valued scope characteristic

**Definition.** `U.Scope ⊆ ContextSliceSpace` is a **set‑valued `U.Characteristic`** whose values are sets of `U.ContextSlice` where a given statement, behavior, or capability is **fit‑for‑use**. It is **not** numeric; its internal order is the subset relation `⊆`. There is no “unit”. The primitive judgement is **membership**: `slice ∈ Scope`.

**Operations.** USM admits:

* **Intersection `∩`** (serial composition).
* **SpanUnion** (parallel, independently supported coverage).
* **Translate** (Cross‑context mapping via Bridge).
* **Widen / Narrow** (monotone changes to the set).
* **Refit** (content‑preserving re‑expression; set equality).

**Locality.** `U.Scope` values are defined and reasoned about **context‑locally**. Translation between Contexts never occurs implicitly; see §7.4.

---

### 6.3 · `U.ClaimScope` (nick **G**) — scope of a claim (episteme)

**Carrier.** `U.Episteme` (claims, specifications, theories, policies).

**Meaning.** The set of `U.ContextSlice` where the **claim holds** as stated. This is **G** in the F–G–R triple. **G is not “abstraction level”**; it is the applicability area of the claim.

**Expression.** Authors SHALL declare Claim scope as explicit predicates or condition blocks (assumptions, parameter ranges, cohorts, platform/contract versions, `Γ_time` windows).

**Path composition (serial).** Along any essential dependency path supporting the claim, the effective scope is the **intersection** of contributors’ Claim scopes (see §7.2). Empty intersection makes the path inapplicable.

**Parallel support.** Where **independent** lines of support justify disjoint areas, the episteme MAY publish a **SpanUnion** (see §7.3) limited strictly to the covered slices.

**Δ‑moves.**

* **ΔG+ (widen).** Replace scope S with S′ such that S ⊂ S′.
* **ΔG− (narrow).** Replace scope S with S′ such that S′ ⊂ S.
* **Refit.** Replace S with S′ where S′ = S (normalization, re‑parametrization).
* **Translate.** Map S across Contexts via a declared Bridge; CL penalties apply to **R**, not to **F/G**.

**Orthogonality.** Changes in **F** (form of expression) or **D/AT** (detail/abstraction tiers) do not change **G** unless the declared area of validity changes.

---

### 6.4 · `U.WorkScope` — scope of doing Work (capability)

**Carrier.** `U.Capability` (a system’s ability to deliver specified `U.Work`).

**Meaning.** The set of `U.ContextSlice` (conditions, contracts, platforms, operating parameters, `Γ_time`) under which the capability can **deliver the intended Work** at the declared **measures**, within declared **qualification windows**.

**Expression.** Capability owners SHALL declare **`U.WorkScope`** as explicit **conditions/constraints over `U.ContextSlice` only** (environment, platforms, contracts by version, resource regimes, `Γ_time`). Quantitative deliverables and operation windows are **not** part of the scope value:  
* Declare targets as **`U.WorkMeasures`** (e.g., latency ≤ L, throughput ≥ T, tolerance ≤ ε) bound in guards (WG‑2).  
* Declare inspection/recertification policies as **`U.QualificationWindow`** bound in guards (WG‑3).  
The use‑time admission requires **all** of: `WorkScope covers JobSlice` **AND** `WorkMeasures satisfied` **AND** `QualificationWindow holds`.

**Method–Work gating.** A Work step’s guard MUST check that the target slice is **covered** by the capability’s Work scope **and** that required measures and qualification windows are satisfied.

**Composition and Δ‑moves.** Work scope uses the **same algebra** as Claim scope (∩ / SpanUnion / translate / widen / narrow / refit). Translation across Contexts follows §7.4.

**Separation from knowledge.** Work scope does **not** assert a proposition about the world; it asserts **deliverability** of Work under conditions. Evidence for deliverability feeds **R** (Reliability) via measurements and monitoring.

**Required guard facets (capabilities).**  
* **`U.WorkMeasures` (mandatory).** A set of measurable targets with units and tolerated ranges, evaluated on the JobSlice.  
* **`U.QualificationWindow` (mandatory for operational use).** A time policy (point/window/rolling) stating when the capability is considered qualified; evaluated at `Γ_time`.  
These facets are **separate** from `U.WorkScope` and live in the **R‑lane** (assurance). They MUST be referenced in Method–Work guards (see §10.3 WG‑2/WG‑3).

## 7 · Scope Algebra

### 7.1 · Membership & Coverage

* **Membership judgement.** `slice ∈ Scope` is the primitive check.
* **Coverage guard.** A guard “Scope **covers** TargetSlice” means either:

  * **singleton:** `TargetSlice ∈ Scope`, or
  * **set:** `TargetSet ⊆ Scope`.
* **No implicit expansion.** Absent an explicit declaration, guards MUST NOT treat “close” slices as covered; widening requires a ΔG+ change.

---

### 7.2 · Serial Composition (Intersection)

**Rule S‑INT (serial).** For an essential dependency chain `C1 → C2 → … → Ck` that supports a claim/capability, the effective scope along that chain is:

```
Scope_serial = ⋂_{i=1..k} Scope(Ci)
```

If `Scope_serial = ∅`, the chain is **inapplicable** and MUST NOT contribute to published scope.

**Monotonicity.** Adding a new essential dependency can only narrow (or leave unchanged) the serial scope.

---

### 7.3 · Parallel Support (SpanUnion)

**Rule P‑UNION (parallel).** If there exist **independent** support lines `L₁,…,Lₙ` for the **same** claim/capability, each with serial scope `S_i`, the publisher MAY declare:

```
Scope_published = SpanUnion({S_i})  =  ⋃_{i=1..n} S_i
```

**Constraints.**

* Independence MUST be justified (different support lines must not rely on the same weakest link).
* The union MUST NOT exceed the union of supported slices; “hopeful” areas are disallowed.
* Publishers SHOULD annotate coverage density/heterogeneity (informative) to aid R assessment, but numeric “coverage” is not part of G.
* **Independence criterion.** Support lines in a **SpanUnion** MUST be partitioned so that each line has a set of **essential components** disjoint from the others’ essential components (no shared weakest link). The partition (or a certificate thereof) SHALL be referenced in the publication.

### 7.4 Why a **G-ladder/levels/scales** is not needed (and **must not** be introduced)

**1) The scale type is not ordinal; it is set‑valued.**
Under MM‑CHR, `U.ClaimScope` is a **set‑valued** `U.Characteristic` over `U.ContextSlice`. The only well‑typed primitives are **membership** and **set operations** (`⊆`, `∩`, `⋃`). Imposing ordinal “levels” such as **G0…Gk** violates the type discipline and produces non‑invariant behavior (the **same set** could be “rated” with different numbers under different heuristics).

**2) G composes via `∩` / `SpanUnion`, not via `min` / `avg`.**
USM already fixes composition: along a **dependent path** use **intersection**; across **independent support lines** publish **SpanUnion**. None of these operations relies on (or preserves) any linear order. An ordinal “G ladder” invites people to take **minimums/averages**, which is **incorrect** for sets and breaks the established algebra.

**3) A G ladder drags in “abstraction level,” which is orthogonal.**
Early “G ladders” effectively encoded **abstraction/typing** (instances → patterns → formal classes/types → up‑to‑iso). That is valuable **didactics**, but **not applicability**. We have already separated these concerns: **abstraction** is captured, if needed, by **`U.AbstractionTier (AT)`** as an optional facet; **applicability** is **`U.ClaimScope (G)`**.

**4) A G ladder breaks locality and Bridge semantics.**
Cross‑context transfer maps a **set** `Scope` via a **Bridge** and penalizes **R** by **CL**. There is no canonical way to “translate” an **ordinal G level** between Contexts: the mapped area may be **strictly narrower** or differently factored. Level numbers would become non‑portable, causing hidden loss or inflation of trust. With USM, we **translate sets** and keep the CL penalty where it belongs—**in R**, not in G.

**5) A G ladder duplicates ESG guards without adding decision power.**
What teams often want to “compress into a G number” is actually (a) the **quality of expression** and (b) the **completeness** of the declared scope. The first is an **F threshold** (e.g., require **`U.Formality ≥ F4`** so the scope is predicate‑like and addressable); the second is handled by explicit **ESG guards**: “**Scope covers TargetSlice**,” “**`Γ_time` is specified**,” and “**freshness window holds**” (R‑lane). A ladder for G adds confusion but no additional control.

**Normative directive.**
`U.ClaimScope (G)` **SHALL** remain a **set‑valued** characteristic; **no ordinal or numeric ladder SHALL be defined** for G. Authoring and gating **SHOULD** use **F thresholds** (C.2.3) and **explicit guard predicates** (A.2.6) rather than pseudo‑levels of G.

### 7.5 · Translation across Contexts (Bridge & CL)

**Rule T‑BRIDGE.** To use a scope in a different bounded context (room), an explicit **Bridge** MUST be declared with:

* **Mapping.** A documented mapping from source to target `U.ContextSlice` vocabulary/characteristics.
* **Congruence Level (CL).** A rating of mapping congruence.
* **Loss notes.** Any known losses, assumptions, or non‑isomorphisms.

**Effect.** The mapped scope is `T(Scope)` in the target Context. **CL penalties apply to R** (the trust in support/evidence), **not to F or G**. If mapping is coarse, the publisher SHOULD also narrow the mapped scope to the area where losses are negligible (best practice, not a requirement).

---

### 7.5 · Δ‑Operations (Widen, Narrow, Refit)

* **ΔG+ (widen).** Monotone expansion: `S ⊂ S′`. Requires new support or stronger bridges.
* **ΔG− (narrow).** Monotone restriction: `S′ ⊂ S`. Often used to remove areas invalidated by new findings.
* **Refit.** `S′ = S` after normalization (e.g., re‑parameterization, changing units, factoring common predicates). Refit MUST NOT alter membership.

**Refit (normalization).** A refit **MUST preserve membership** exactly (S′ = S). Any change that alters boundary inclusion (due to rounding, unit conversion, discretization) is a ΔG± change, not a refit.

**Edition triggers.** Any change that alters the published set (ΔG±) is a content change and MAY trigger a new edition per Context policy (see A.2.x on editions). Refit is not a content change.

### 7.6 · Invariants

* **I‑LOCAL.** All scope evaluation is **context‑local**. Cross‑context usage MUST follow §7.4.
* **I‑SERIAL.** Serial scope is an **intersection**; it cannot grow by adding dependencies.
* **I‑PARALLEL.** Parallel scope MAY grow by union, but only where **independently supported**.
* **I‑WLNK.** Weakest‑link applies to **F** and **R** on dependency paths; **G** follows set rules (∩ / ⋃).
* **I‑IDS.** Idempotence: Intersecting or unioning a set with itself does not change it.
* **I‑EMPTY.** Empty scope is a first‑class value; guards MUST treat it as “not applicable”.

---

### 7.7 · Empty & Partial Scopes

* **Empty scope (`∅`).** The claim/capability is **currently not usable anywhere** in the Context; guards MUST fail.
* **Partial scope.** Publishers SHOULD avoid “global” language when actual scope is thin; instead, publish explicit slices and (informatively) coverage hints to guide R assessment.

---

## 8 · Locality, Time & Version Semantics

### 8.1 · context‑locality

Scopes are **owned and evaluated** within a `U.BoundedContext`. State assertions (ESG/RSG) and Method–Work gates MUST NOT assume that a scope declared in another Context applies verbatim; see §7.4.

### 8.2 · Time selector `Γ_time`

Every scope declaration and every guard MUST specify a **`Γ_time` selector** (point, window, or policy such as “rolling 180 days”) whenever time‑dependent assumptions exist. Implicit “latest” is forbidden. When `Γ_time` differs between contributors, serial intersection resolves the overlap.

### 8.3 · Contracts, versions & notations

Scope predicates SHALL name contracts/interfaces/schemas **by version**. Changing symbols/notations with a faithful mapping does not change **G** (it may change **CL** for the mapping and thus affect **R**).

### 8.4 · Determinism of evaluation

Given fixed inputs (slice tuple, declared scope), the membership judgement MUST be deterministic. Guards SHALL fail closed (no membership ⇒ no use).

### 8.5 · Interaction with R (freshness & decay)

For empirical claims and operational capabilities, **R** typically binds evidence freshness windows. Scope does not decay with time; **trust in the support** does. Guards MAY combine “Scope covers” with “Evidence freshness holds” as separate predicates.

---

## 9 · Lexical Discipline (Part E compliance)

**L‑USM‑1 (names).** Use **Claim scope (G)** for epistemes and **Work scope** for capabilities. Use **Scope** only when discussing the abstract mechanism. Avoid naming characteristics “applicability,” “envelope,” “generality,” “capability envelope,” or “validity”.

**L‑USM‑2 (Work/Run).** Prefer **Work/Run** vocabulary from A.15 for system execution contexts. Do not introduce “operation/operating” as characteristic names; use **Work scope**.

**L‑USM‑3 (Validation).** “Validation/Validate” remain reserved for **LA** in assurance lanes (Part B). Do not name the scope characteristic “validity”.

**L‑USM‑4 (Domain).** “Domain” is a descriptive convenience. Scopes are evaluated on **Context slices**; guards SHALL reference slices, not generic “domains”.

**L‑USM‑5 (First mention).** On first use in a Context, include the parenthetical nick: *“Claim scope (**G**)”* to preserve the F–G–R mapping.

## 10 · Guard Patterns (ESG & Method–Work)

### 10.1 · Common guard shape

A scope‑aware guard has the form:

```
Guard := ScopeCoverage AND TimePolicy AND (EvidenceFreshness?) AND (BridgePolicy?)
```

Where:

* **ScopeCoverage**: `Scope covers TargetSlice` (singleton or finite set), see §7.1.
* **TimePolicy**: explicit `Γ_time` selector(s); implicit “latest” is forbidden (§8.2).
* **EvidenceFreshness**: optional R‑lane freshness/decay predicates; **separate** from ScopeCoverage (§8.5).
* **BridgePolicy**: required if the Scope and TargetSlice are in **different Contexts**; declares Bridge, CL, loss notes (§7.4).

The guard **fails closed** (no membership ⇒ denial), and evaluation is **deterministic** given the slice tuple (§8.4).

---

### 10.2 · ESG guard families (epistemes)

**EG‑1 · ClaimScopeCoverage (mandatory).**
The state transition MUST include a predicate:

```
U.ClaimScope(episteme) covers TargetSlice
```

* **Singleton**: `TargetSlice ∈ ClaimScope`.
* **Finite set**: `TargetSet ⊆ ClaimScope`.

**EG‑2 · Formality threshold (if required by ESG).**
When rigor is gated, the guard MUST reference C.2.3:

```
U.Formality(episteme) ≥ F_k
```

**EG‑3 · Evidence freshness (R‑lane).**
If the state implies trust, a separate predicate MUST assert freshness windows for bound evidence:

```
Fresh(evidence, window)  AND  (NoExpiredBindings)
```

**EG‑4 · Cross‑context usage.**
If `TargetSlice.Context ≠ episteme.Context`, the guard MUST require a declared Bridge and CL:

```
Bridge(source=episteme.Context, target=TargetSlice.Context)  AND  CL ≥ c
```

> **Effect:** CL penalties apply to **R**, not to **F/G** (§7.4). The ESG guard MAY also **narrow** the mapped Claim scope when mapping losses are known.

**EG‑5 · ΔG triggers.**
If the transition publishes a **wider** Claim scope (ΔG+), the guard MUST capture the new support or the new Bridge and, if Context policy so dictates, mint a new edition (PhaseOf).

**EG‑6 · Independence for SpanUnion (when claiming parallel scope).**
When the episteme declares a **SpanUnion** across independent lines, the guard MUST include an **independence justification** (pointer to the support partition). No independence ⇒ no union.

*(Informative note.)* Managers often combine EG‑1 (coverage) + EG‑2 (F threshold) + EG‑3 (freshness) for “Effective” or “Approved” states, and EG‑4 when adopting claims across Contexts.

---

### 10.3 · Method–Work guard families (capabilities)

**WG‑1 · WorkScopeCoverage (mandatory).**
A capability can be used to deliver a Work step only if:

```
U.WorkScope(capability) covers JobSlice
```

**WG‑2 · `U.WorkMeasures` satisfied** (mandatory for deliverables).
Guards MUST bind quantitative measures that the capability promises in the JobSlice:

```
SLO/target measures satisfied (latency ≤ L, throughput ≥ T, tolerance ≤ ε, ...)
```

**WG‑3 · `U.QualificationWindow` holds** (mandatory for operational use).
Operational guards MUST assert that qualification windows (qualification/inspection/recert intervals) hold **at `Γ_time`**:

```
ValidityWindow(capability) holds at Γ_time
```

**WG‑4 · Cross‑context use of capability.**
If the JobSlice is in another Context:

```
Bridge(source=capability.Context, target=JobSlice.Context)  AND  CL ≥ c
```

CL penalties affect **R** (confidence in deliverability), **not** Work scope; however, the guard SHOULD narrow the mapped Work scope to account for known mapping losses.

**WG‑5 · Δ(WorkScope).**
When widening Work scope (new operating ranges/platforms), the guard MUST require evidence at the new slices (measures + qualification windows). Refit (e.g., new units/parametrization) requires no new evidence.

---

### 10.4 · Bridge‑aware guard macro (reusable)

A reusable macro for Cross‑context guards:

```
Guard_XContext(Scope, TargetSlice) :=
    exists Bridge b: (b.source = owner(Scope).Context AND b.target = TargetSlice.Context)
AND CL(b) ≥ c
AND Scope’ = translate(b, Scope)
AND Scope’ covers TargetSlice
AND (Apply CL penalty to R)
```

* **Owner(Scope).** The carrier that declares the scope: an **Episteme** (for `U.ClaimScope`) or a **Capability** (for `U.WorkScope`).  
* **Translate(b, Scope).** The partial mapping of a set of source slices to target slices induced by Bridge **b**. If a source slice is unmappable, it is dropped. The result is a set of target slices; **CL penalties apply to R only**.
* **Penalty to R**: applied per trust calculus; F and G remain as declared.

### 10.5 · Selector policy (Γ\_time)

All ESG and Method–Work guards MUST spell out **`Γ_time`**:

* **Point** (“as of 2026‑03‑31T00:00Z”).
* **Window** (“rolling 180 days”).
* **Policy** (“last lab calibration within 90 days”).

Implicit “latest” is not allowed. If multiple contributors declare different policies, **serial intersection** computes the overlap (§8.2).

## 12 · Worked Examples

> Each example declares the Context, the scope, the target slice, and shows the guard outcome. Where relevant, serial intersection, SpanUnion, and Bridge & CL are illustrated.

### 12.1 · Research claim (controlled narrative → predicate)

* **Context:** `MaterialsLab@2026`.
* **Episteme:** claim “Adhesive X retains ≥85 % tensile strength on Al6061 for 2 h at 120–150 °C.”
* **Claim scope (G):** `{substrate=Al6061, temp∈[120,150]°C, dwell≤2h, Γ_time = window(1y), rig=Calib‑v3}`.
* **Target slice:** `{substrate=Al6061, temp=140 °C, dwell=90 min, Γ_time=2026‑04‑02, rig=Calib‑v3}`.
* **Guard (EG‑1, EG‑2):** `covers(TargetSlice)` **true**; `U.Formality ≥ F4` **true** (predicates in spec).
* **Outcome:** state transition allowed (freshness checked separately under R).

### 12.2 · Cross‑context use of the research claim

* **target Context:** `AssemblyFloor@EU‑PLANT‑B`.
* **Bridge:** declared mapping of rigs and temp measurement correction; **CL=2** (loss: ±2 °C bias).
* **Mapped Claim scope:** `translate(Bridge, G)` narrows temp to `[122,148]°C`.
* **Guard (EG‑4):** Bridge present, `CL≥2` **true**; **R** is penalized per Φ(CL).
* **Outcome:** allowed; **G** remains the mapped set; **R** lowered.

### 12.3 · Capability: robotic weld Work scope

* **Context:** `RobotCell‑Weld@2026`.
* **Capability:** “Weld seam W at bead width 2.5 ± 0.3 mm, cycle ≤ 12 s.”
* **Work scope:** `{humidity<60 %, current∈[35,45]A, wire=ER70S‑6, Γ_time=rolling(90d), controller=FW‑2.1}`.
* **Job slice:** `{humidity=55 %, current=40A, wire=ER70S‑6, Γ_time=now, controller=FW‑2.1}`.
* **Guards (WG‑1..3):** coverage **true**; measures satisfied; qualification window **true** (controller certified 60 d ago).
* **Outcome:** capability admitted for this Work.

### 12.4 · Serial intersection (API + dataset compatibility)

* **Claim A (API contract):** `v2.3` request schema with constraint “idempotent under retry”.
* **Claim B (Dataset cohort):** “metrics valid for cohort K with schema `ds‑14`”.
* **Composition:** service S depends on both A and B → **serial intersection** of Claim scopes: `{api=v2.3} ∩ {cohort=K, schema=ds‑14}`.
* **Target slice:** `{api=v2.3, cohort=K, schema=ds‑14}` → membership **true**.
* **Any drift (e.g., `ds‑15`)** empties the intersection ⇒ path inapplicable.

### 12.5 · Parallel support (SpanUnion) in a safety case

* **Line L1:** tests on **dry asphalt** support braking property; scope `S1={surface=dry, speed≤50 km/h}`.
* **Line L2:** simulations for **wet asphalt**; scope `S2={surface=wet, speed≤40 km/h}`.
* **Published scope:** `SpanUnion({S1,S2})` = `{(dry, ≤50), (wet, ≤40)}` with independence note (L1 empirical, L2 model‑validated).
* **Guard:** allowed; union does **not** include `(wet, 45)` because not supported.

### 12.6 · ML model deployment across Contexts

* **Model claim:** “AUC ≥ 0.92 on cohort K, pipeline P, features F, `Γ_time=rolling(180d)`.”
* **Claim scope:** `{cohort=K, pipeline=P, features=F, Γ_time=rolling(180d)}`.
* **target Context:** product `On‑Device@v7`, features `F’` (subset), pipeline `P’`.
* **Bridge:** declared mapping `F→F’`, `P→P’`, **CL=1** (notably lossy).
* **Guard:** Bridge present; `translate(G)` covers a **strict subset**; CL=1 penalizes **R** strongly; ESG requires **F≥F5** (executable semantics) and **freshness < 90 d**.
* **Outcome:** allowed only for the covered subset; adoption flagged with reduced **R**.

## 13 · Playbooks (Informative)

### 13.1 · Manager’s 6‑step adoption checklist

1. **Name the TargetSlice.** Write the tuple (Context, versions, environment params, `Γ_time`).
2. **Check scope coverage.** “Claim/Work scope covers TargetSlice?” If **no**, either **ΔG+** (publish wider scope with support) or **decline**.
3. **Check rigor if gated.** If ESG requires it, ensure `U.Formality ≥ F_k`.
4. **Check evidence freshness (R).** Validate windows/decay policies; do not conflate with coverage.
5. **Bridge if Cross‑context.** Require declared Bridge, CL, and loss notes; accept **R** penalties.
6. **Record the decision.** Keep the slice and guard outcomes with the StateAssertion (auditability).

### 13.2 · Architect’s design rubric for scopes

* **Prefer predicates over prose.** Name parameters, ranges, contracts by **version**, and `Γ_time`.
* **Factor common conditions.** Use Refit to normalize units and factor shared predicates; do not widen by stealth.
* **Partition support lines.** If you plan a **SpanUnion**, document independence up front.
* **Keep scope thin & honest.** Publish what you can support; add slices as support appears (ΔG+).
* **Design Bridges early.** When interop is planned, sketch mapping characteristics and **expected CL**; plan **R** penalties.

### 13.3 · Review anti‑patterns & fixes

| Anti‑pattern                                    | Why it’s wrong                   | Fix                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Latest” time by default                        | Non‑deterministic; violates §8.2 | Declare `Γ_time` explicitly (point/window/policy)          |
| Using “domain” in guards                        | Not addressable; hides slices    | Replace with concrete `U.ContextSlice` tuples              |
| Treating “more abstract wording” as wider scope | Abstraction ≠ applicability      | Keep **AT/D** separate; widen **G** only with explicit ΔG+ |
| Publishing union without independence           | Overstates coverage              | Justify independence or publish serial intersection only   |
| Cross‑context use without Bridge                   | Silent semantic drift            | Require Bridge + CL; apply **R** penalties                 |

### 13.4 · Minimal DSL snippet for scope blocks (illustrative)

## 14 · Governance Hooks & Audits

### 14.1 · Governance metadata (normative)

Contexts that adopt USM SHALL record, per scope‑aware decision:

* **Owner & carrier.** Episteme (for Claim scope) or Capability (for Work scope).
* **TargetSlice tuple.** Context, vocab/roles, versioned contracts, environment selectors, **`Γ_time`**.
* **Guard outcomes.** Membership result, Bound measures (for Work scope), Freshness predicates (R).
* **Bridge info (if any).** Mapping summary, **CL**, loss notes, applied R penalty.
* **ΔG log.** Widen/narrow/refit; edition policy outcome.

### 14.2 · USM compliance levels (informative)

* **USM‑Ready.** Context declares adoption; editors trained; lexicon updated.
* **USM‑Guarded.** All ESG/Method–Work guards use Claim/Work scope and `Γ_time`.
* **USM‑Auditable.** Decision records include TargetSlice tuples and Bridge/CL details.
* **USM‑Composed.** Serial intersection and SpanUnion are implemented in composition tooling.

### 14.3 · Audit checklist (informative)

* Does each guard **name** a concrete **TargetSlice**?
* Is **membership** deterministically recomputable from published predicates?
* Are **freshness** and **coverage** separate predicates?
* For Cross‑context use: is there a **Bridge** with **CL** and loss notes?
* For parallel support: is **independence** justified?

### 14.4 · Risk controls (informative)

* **Silent widening.** Require ΔG+ review; flag any scope increase without new support/Bridge.
* **Opaque slices.** Disallow “domain” placeholders; enforce addressable selectors.
* **Time drift.** Require `Γ_time` policies (rolling windows) for time‑sensitive scopes.

---

## 15 · Cross‑Pattern Coordination

### 15.1 · With F–G–R (C.2.2)

* **G is Claim scope.** Use set algebra (∩ / SpanUnion).
* **F** remains the expression rigor (C.2.3); **R** captures evidence freshness and CL penalties.
* **Weakest‑link.** On dependency paths: **F\_composite = min(F)**, **R\_composite = min(R)**; **G** follows §7.2–§7.3 (set rules).

### 15.2 · With Formality (C.2.3)

* **No conflation.** Raising **F** does not change **G** unless scope predicates change.
* **Guarding rigor.** ESG may use `U.Formality ≥ F_k` alongside scope coverage.

### 15.3 · With Work & Run (A.15)

* **Work scope** aligns with the **execution context** of `U.Work`.
* Method–Work gates use **Work scope coverage** plus **measures** and **qualification windows**.

### 15.4 · With Bridges & CL (Part B)

* **CL only impacts R.** CL penalties reduce trust; they never rewrite **F** or **G**.
* **Best practice.** Narrow mapped scopes where mapping losses are material.

### 15.5 · With Capability governance (A.2.2)

* Capabilities MUST declare **Work scope**, **measures**, **qualification windows**; gates MUST verify all three.
* Capability refits that preserve the set (unit changes) are **Refit**, not Δ(WorkScope).

## 16 · Extended FAQ (informative)

**Q1. Is “Claim scope” the same as “domain”?**
**No.** “Domain” is descriptive and often fuzzy. **Claim scope** is **addressable**: it names concrete `U.ContextSlice` conditions and a **`Γ_time`** policy. Guards MUST reference slices, not generic “domains”.

**Q2. How do we express partial coverage across different cohorts or platforms?**
Declare each supported serial scope (`S₁, S₂, …`) and publish **SpanUnion({Sᵢ})** with independence justification. Do **not** include unsupported slices.

**Q3. Can raising F (formalizing) widen G?**
Only if the formalization **explicitly changes** the scope predicates (ΔG+). Formalization alone does not widen scope.

**Q4. What is the difference between Work scope and SLOs?**
**Work scope** is **where** the capability can deliver; **measures** within the guard are **what** it promises there (SLO targets). Both are required at use time (WG‑1..3).

**Q5. Can we assign numeric coverage to G?**
Not normatively. G is set‑valued. You MAY attach **informative** coverage metrics (e.g., proportions) to aid **R** assessment, but guards use set membership.

**Q6. How do we handle “latest data” scopes?**
You don’t. Declare a **`Γ_time`** policy (e.g., rolling 90 days). “Latest” is forbidden to ensure reproducible evaluation.

**Q7. How do we move a scope to another Context?**
Declare a **Bridge** with **CL** and loss notes; compute `translate(Bridge, Scope)`; apply CL penalty to **R**; consider narrowing the mapped set.

**Q8. What about abstraction level or detail?**
Keep **AT (AbstractionTier)** and **D (Detail/Resolution)** as orthogonal, optional annotations. They never substitute for **Claim/Work scope**.

**Q9. Can a capability’s Work scope be broader than an upstream claim’s Claim scope?**
They are on different carriers. In a serial dependency, the **effective** scope is the **intersection**; the broader one does not dominate.

**Q10. When does an empty scope make sense?**
It indicates “not usable anywhere (here, now)”. Guards MUST fail. This is common during early drafting or after a refutation.

**Summary.** Across all Contexts, two stable notions recur: (1) **evaluate in a concrete context** (→ `U.ContextSlice`), and (2) **declare where something holds/is deliverable** (→ set‑valued **Scope**). “Context of use,” “operating modes,” “targets,” “class extension,” and “OSED” are all Context‑flavored presentations of **Claim scope** or **Work scope**. Terms like *validity* and *operation* are semantically close but collide with **LA** and FPF’s **Work/Run** lexicon; we therefore **do not** adopt them as characteristic names.

### 17.4.3 · F.18 Term Selection — Unified Tech & Plain names

#### 17.4.3.1 Selected names (normative)

| Capability applicability        | **`U.WorkScope`**                               | **Work scope**                       | “capability envelope”, “operational applicability”, “operation scope” |

| Serial dependency               | **Intersection**                                | **Intersection of scopes**           | —                    | ordinal “more/less general” language                                  |
| Scope edits                     | **ΔG+ (widen), ΔG− (narrow), Refit, Translate** | **Widen, narrow, refit, translate**  | —                    | stealth widening (“it’s obvious”)                                     |

**Why these names (decision grounds):**

* **“Scope” wins over “envelope/applicability/validity”.** It is short, **self‑documenting**, and already idiomatic in SRE/SW, while “validity” clashes with **Validation Assurance (LA)** and “envelope” suggests geometry, not **membership**.
* **“Claim scope” vs “Work scope”.** Two‑word compounds meet the FPF clarity rule: the first token reveals the **carrier** (Claim vs Work/Capability), the second the **mechanism** (scope).
* **Keep **G**.** The F–G–R triple is canonical; we retain **G** as nickname for **Claim scope**.
* **“Context slice”** is the only term that makes the evaluation target **addressable** (Context, versions, params, **Γ\_time**).
* **“Operation/operating/validity” avoided.** They are **overloaded** in existing FPF lanes (Work/Run, LA) and create policy ambiguities in guards.

#### 17.4.3.2 Phrasebook (for editors, normative)

* Use **“Claim scope (G) covers TargetSlice”** and **“Work scope covers JobSlice”** in guards.
* Always spell **`Γ_time`**; never say “latest”.
* To compose, say: **“intersection along dependency paths; SpanUnion across independent support lines.”**
* For Cross‑context use, say: **“via Bridge; CL penalties apply to R (trust), not to F/G (content/scope).”**
* When widening/narrowing, write **“ΔG+ / ΔG−”** and log the support change; use **“Refit”** for unit/param normalization.

---

**Outcome.** The UTS shows strong convergence across SoTA Contexts on **addressable context** and **set‑valued applicability**. F.18 therefore fixes: **Context slice**, **Scope**, **Claim scope (G)**, **Work scope**, with the algebra and guard clauses mandated in A.2.6. This closes synonym drift while remaining readable for engineering managers and precise for assurance tooling.

 
# A.3 Transformer Constitution (Quartet)  \[A]

## 1 · Intent

Establish a single, substrate‑neutral way to say **who acts**, **under which role**, **according to which description**, **by which capability**, and **what actually happened**—without “self‑magic” and without blurring design‑time and run‑time. The pattern fixes the **Transformer Quartet** so all kernel and Γ‑patterns reuse the *same four anchors*. It builds directly on **Holon‑Role Duality (A.2)** and **Temporal Duality (A.4)** and is guarded by **Strict Distinction (A.7)** and **Evidence Anchoring (A.10)**.

## 2 · Context

* **Holonic substrate.** FPF separates *what things are* (Holon → {System, Episteme, …}) from *what they are being right now* via **roles**. Only **systems** can bear **behavioural** roles and execute methods/work; epistemes are changed **via their symbol carriers**.
* **Role as mask; behaviour as method/work.** A role is a **mask**, not behaviour; behaviour is a **Method** (order‑sensitive capability) that may be executed as **Work** (dated occurrence).
* **Design‑time vs run‑time.** A holon’s states belong to disjoint scopes **Tᴰ** and **Tᴿ**; transitions are physically grounded by a system bearing **TransformerRole**.
* **Evidence & carriers.** Claims about outcomes must anchor to **carriers** (SCR/RSCR) and to an **external** evidencing transformer.

## 3 · Problem

Legacy phrasing (“actor / process / blueprint”) causes recurrent failures:

1. **Self‑magic:** “the system configures itself” (no external acting side, causality lost).
2. **Plan = event:** blueprint/algorithm reported as if execution happened.
3. **Capability = result:** possession of a method counted as evidence of work.
4. **Episteme as doer:** documents/models treated as actors.
5. **Scope leak:** design‑time and run‑time mixed; run traces lack carriers/method ties.
   A.2/A.4/A.7/A.10 collectively forbid these, but A.3 must give the **canonical quartet** that authors can apply consistently.

## 4 · Forces

| Force                       | Tension                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identity vs behaviour**   | Keep holon identity stable while roles/behaviours change.                                   |
| **Simplicity vs precision** | Managers want one “process” box; kernel must keep **MethodDescription / Method / Work** distinct.  |
| **Universality vs idioms**  | Pumps, proofs, and data‑pipelines must read the same, yet allow domain names.               |
| **Design vs run**           | No overlap of **Tᴰ** and **Tᴿ**; bridges explicit and causal.                               |
| **Evidence vs mereology**   | Provenance edges (EPV‑DAG) must never turn into part‑whole edges.                           |

## 5 · Solution — The Transformer Quartet

A.3 defines four anchors, tied together by **Role Assignment (`U.RoleAssignment`)** and aligned with **Temporal Duality**.

### 5.1 The four anchors (terms & types)

1. **Acting side:** a **system bearing TransformerRole** — the only holon kind allowed to enact transformations (behavioural role). *Canonical phrase:* **“system bearing TransformerRole”**. *Local shorthand:* after explicit binding in the **same subsection**, you MAY write **“Transformer”** to denote that same system; re‑bind on context change and **do not** use shorthand where the domain already has a conflicting “transformer” term.

2. **MethodDescription (design‑time description):** protocol / algorithm / SOP / script — all are **idioms of MethodDescription**; they live in **Tᴰ** and are **epistemes** with carriers (SCR/RSCR).

3. **Method (design‑time capability):** order‑sensitive composition the system *can* enact at run‑time (Γ\_method); it is **not** an occurrence.

4. **Work (run‑time occurrence):** dated execution producing state change and consuming resources (Γ\_work); every Work **isExecutionOf** exactly one MethodDescription version and is **performedBy** exactly one performer (possibly a collective system).

> **Safe memory line:** *MethodDescription → (describes) Method → (executed as) Work.*
> Roles are **masks** (A.2/A.7); methods/work are **behaviour**.

### 5.2 Contextual Role Assignmnent (`U.RoleAssignment`) for transformations

Use the universal assignment to state **who plays which role where and when**:

```
U.RoleAssignment(
  holder  : U.System,          -- the acting system (bearer)
  role    : U.TransformerRole, -- behavioural role
  context : U.BoundedContext,  -- semantic boundary
  timespan?: Interval          -- optional validity window
)
```

* A role is **local to context** and **time‑indexed**.
* The same system may bear multiple roles **if** the context allows compatibility.
* For epistemes, the target of change is their **symbol carriers**; the acting side is still a **system**.

### 5.3 Boundary & externality

Every transformation is modelled with **two sides** and an explicit **U.Interaction** boundary: **acting** (system bearing TransformerRole) and **target** (system being transformed, or the **carrier** of an episteme). There is **no self‑doing**; “self‑like” stories are handled by the **reflexive split** (regulator vs regulated subsystems) or by promoting a meta‑holon and keeping evidence external (A.12).

### 5.4 Temporal alignment (A.4 bridge)

* **MethodDescription** lives in **Tᴰ**;
* **Method** is defined at design-time and **executed as `U.Work` at run-time by a `U.System` with a valid `U.RoleAssignment` (window-aligned) and a live **StateAssertion** for an **enactable** RSG state**;
* **Work** lives in **Tᴿ**;
* transitions **Tᴰ → Tᴿ** and **Tᴿ → Tᴰ** are **grounded** by executions of appropriate methods by an **external** transformer (e.g., fabrication or observation).

### 5.5 Evidence anchoring

Each Work anchors to **carriers** and to the **MethodDescription** it instantiates; evidencing transformers are **external** (no self‑evidence). This sits in the **EPV‑DAG** and never in mereology.

### 5.6 Didactic dictionary (safe mappings)

* “Process / Workflow / SOP / Algorithm” ⇒ **MethodDescription** (design‑time description).
* “Operation / Job / Run / Performance” ⇒ **Work** (run‑time occurrence).
* “Function (equipment spec)” ⇒ **Method** (or MethodDescription if purely textual).
* “Creator” (legacy) ⇒ **Transformer** (shorthand for **system bearing TransformerRole** after local binding).

## 6 · Illustrative scenarios (substrate‑neutral)

**6.1 Physical system — Cooling loop**
`PumpUnit#3` (**system bearing TransformerRole**) executes `ChannelFluid` (**Method**) as per `centrifugal_pump_curve.ld` (**MethodDescription**), producing `run‑2025‑08‑08‑T14:03` (**Work**, 3.6 kWh; ΔT=6 K). Evidence goes to carriers in SCR; resource spend goes to Γ\_work.

**6.2 Epistemic change — Proof revision**
`LeanServer` (**system bearing TransformerRole**) edits `proof_tactic.lean` (carrier) per MethodDescription; `lemma‑42‑check‑2025‑08‑08` is **Work**; the **episteme** (theorem) changes through its carriers; evidence is attributed to the external transformer.

**6.3 Reflexive maintenance — “calibrates itself”**
Split into **Regulator** (calibration module, acting side) and **Regulated** (sensor suite, target) with an interaction boundary; credit evidence to the regulator; no self‑evidence.

### 6 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A3‑0 · U.RoleAssgnment presence.**
Every claim that a holon “performs a transformation” MUST be backed by at least one **RoleAssignment** triple:
`U.RoleAssignment(holder: U.Holon, role: U.Role=TransformerRole, context: U.BoundedContext, timespan?)`.
This is the canonical way to say *who acts, in which role, where (semantically), and when*. See **A.2.1** for the universal **`U.RoleAssignment`** contract and its invariants.

**CC‑A3‑1 · External transformer discipline.**
The **bearer** of `TransformerRole` MUST NOT be the same model instance as the **object‑under‑change** within the same assignment. Self-modification is modelled via two **`U.RoleAssignment`s** (same holder playing two roles) or via an explicit controller–plant split. This upholds **Agent Externalization** (A.12).

**CC‑A3‑2 · Design–Run separation.**
`U.MethodDescription` (recipe, definition) is a **design‑time** artefact; `U.Method` (mask‑of‑work) and `U.Work` (executed work) are **run‑time**. It is non‑conformant to mutate a `MethodDescription` inside a `Work` log or to treat a `Work` as a `MethodDescription`. This enforces the kernel’s **Temporal Duality** (A.4) and the A.15 alignment.

**CC‑A3‑3 · Boundary‑crossing evidence.**
A conformant transformation that changes a system’s state MUST reference the **boundary effects** it induces: interactions, flows, or state transitions attach to the target system’s boundary (per Γ‑defaults for additive, min/AND/OR folds). Conservation‑class effects MUST satisfy B‑invariants (e.g., **B‑1 Conservation**).

**CC‑A3‑4 · Method ←→ Work traceability.**
Every `U.Work` MUST (i) name the `U.Method` it instantiates and (ii) trace the `U.MethodDescription` it claims to follow (versioned). If a deviation occurs, it MUST be logged as a **policy override** or **exception path**; silent drift is non‑conformant. (A.15 guards the vocabulary; Γ\_work aggregates resource deltas.)

**CC‑A3‑5 · Episteme as object‑under‑change.**
When the changed holon is an **episteme** (document, dataset, theory), the transformer is still a **system**; the episteme’s history MUST be recorded via **PhaseOf** (versioning) and **ConstituentOf/PortionOf** as appropriate (not via component trees). See A.14’s mereology firewalls and Γ\_epist hooks.

**CC‑A3‑6 · Units and measures for resource effects.**
Any resource consumption/production in `U.Work` MUST specify the **measure μ** and **units** (e.g., kg, J, bytes); “percentage” effects MUST be grounded in a PortionOf μ to be Γ‑aggregatable. (A.14 POR‑axioms; Γ\_work usage.)

**CC‑A3‑7 · Provenance minimum.**
For each `U.RoleAssignment` and `U.Work`, the following fields are REQUIRED: `{authority?, justification?, provenance?}` where `justification: U.Episteme` and `provenance: U.Method`/process evidence. This aligns with the kernel’s governance and B‑cluster lineage practices.

**CC‑A3‑8 · Policy–Plan–Action separation for agentic cases.**
If the transformer bearer is agentic, the log MUST separate `D.Policy → U.PlannedAction → U.Action` (A.15/A.13), preserving where failure occurred (strategy, plan, or execution).

**CC‑A3‑9 · Context‑local conflicts.**
Conflicts among roles (including `TransformerRole`) are only **within the same bounded context**; cross‑context differences are admissible if bridges are declared. Non‑conformance arises only when a context’s own incompatibility rules are violated. (A.2.1 `U.RoleAssignment` invariants.)

**CC‑A3‑10 · Γ‑compatibility.**
Descriptions MUST be sufficient for the relevant Γ‑aggregations to run: Γ\_method for recipe composition, Γ\_work for resource deltas, Γ\_sys for boundary integration, Γ\_time for ordering. Each Γ flavour declares its A.14 hooks (Portion/Phase) and inherits B‑invariants.

---

### 7 · Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Explainability by construction.** Every transformative claim carries *who/what/when/why/how* via **`U.RoleAssignment`** + provenance fields; audits become mechanical rather than heroic. (B‑invariants and Γ tables do the heavy lifting.)
* **No category errors.** Keeping methods/roles out of mereology and enforcing design/run separation prevents the usual “process‑as‑part” and “version‑as‑component” mistakes. (A.14 + A.15.)
* **Composable analytics.** With measures and boundary folds explicit, cross‑scale proofs (Σ/Π/min/∧/∨) are predictable.
* **Contextual pluralism without chaos.** Divergent domain practices coexist as distinct bounded contexts with bridges; disagreements are localised and tractable.

**Trade‑offs**

* **More declarations up‑front.**  `U.RoleAssignment` + units + policy/plan/action feels verbose, but yields deterministic Γ‑runs and reproducible audits.
* **Discipline for “self‑modifiers.”** Modellers must split controller vs plant or dual‑role the same carrier; this adds one line but avoids hidden identity conflations.

---

### 8 · Rationale (post‑2015 cross‑domain support)

**Constructor theory (post‑2015).**
Our **Transformer Principle** mirrors constructor theory’s shift from *dynamics* to *tasks*: what transformations are **possible** vs **impossible**, and why. By making the **transformer** (constructor) an explicit bearer of a role and keeping recipes as `MethodDescription`, A.3 captures the core “tasks & constructors” distinction and aligns with constructor‑theoretic thermodynamics linking work, heat, and informational constraints. ([Royal Society Publishing][1], [arXiv][2], [Constructor Theory][3])

**Active inference & free‑energy mechanics (2017→).**
Where transformers are *agentic*, A.3’s policy–plan–action split and boundary‑centred accounting dovetail with **active inference** and **free‑energy** formulations of self‑organising systems (Markov blankets; Bayesian mechanics). This legitimises `U.Objective`/cost function links and makes design–run duality natural (prior vs posterior policies). ([MIT Press Direct][4], [PubMed][5], [arXiv][6])

**Provenance and FAIR packaging (2016→).**
Provenance minima in CC‑A3‑7 reflect **FAIR** principles (machine‑actionable reuse), **RO‑Crate** (methods+data+context packaged together), and operational lineage standards such as **OpenLineage** and **ML Metadata (TFX)** that treat *artefacts, runs, and jobs* as first‑class, with typed facets and versioning — exactly what enactment + Γ\_work need. ([Nature][7], [researchobject.org][8], [SAGE Journals][9], [openlineage.io][10], [GitHub][11], [arXiv][12])

Together, these lines of work argue for **explicit role‑bearing transformers**, **recipe/run separation**, **boundary‑grounded deltas**, and **traceable contexts** — the four pillars that CC‑A3 enforces.

---

### 9 · Relations

**A.7 Strict Distinction.**
A.3 operationalises A.7 by keeping **object ≠ description ≠ observation**:
*object* = target holon; *description* = `MethodDescription`; *observation/log* = `Work`. Violations (e.g., treating a recipe as a part) are non‑conformant and usually surface as Γ failures.

**A.12 Agent Externalization & External Transformer.**
A.3’s CC‑A3‑1 is the mechanical guard‑rail for A.12: even in self‑modification, the *modelling split* keeps the agent (transformer bearer) distinct from the object‑under‑change.

**A.13 Agential Role.**
When the bearer is an **Agent**, A.3 defers identity and states management to Agent‑CAL (`U.Agent`, `U.Intent`, `U.Action`), while still requiring `RoleAssigning` + Γ compatibility. This is where policy/plan/action pipelines live.

**A.15 Role–Method–Work Alignment.**
A.3 relies on A.15’s vocabulary guard‑rails (roles are not parts; methods are masks of work; specs are recipes). CC‑A3‑2/‑4 are enforceable precisely because A.15 fixes the naming discipline.

**A.14 Advanced Mereology.**
A.3 consumes A.14’s **PortionOf** (for quantitative deltas) and **PhaseOf** (for versioning) and forbids role/recipe leakage into part–whole trees. Γ‑flavours declare which A.14 hooks they use.

**B‑cluster (Γ‑sections).**
A.3 is executable only because Γ‑operators provide aggregation and invariants:

* **Γ\_sys** enforces boundary folds and conservation;
* **Γ\_epist** preserves document/data provenance and versioning;
* **Γ\_time** orders work;
* **Γ\_method** composes recipes;
* **Γ\_work** accounts resource deltas; each inherits B‑invariants (e.g., B‑1 Conservation, B‑2 No‑Duplication).

**Indexing to the glossary.**
Terms used here (TransformerRole, Work, Method, MethodDescription, PortionOf, PhaseOf, BoundedContext) remain exactly as defined in Annex A; see A.1/A.2/A.14/A.15 entries for lexical registers.

# A.3.1 — U.Method  \[D]

## 1 · Context (plain‑language motivation)

Teams must talk about **how** something is done without entangling:

* **Who** is assigned (that is **Role**/**RoleAssigning**),
* **Whether** the holder can do it (that is **Capability**), and
* **What actually happened** (that is **Work**).

`U.Method` supplies the *how*—the **abstract way of performing a transformation**, independent of a specific run, a specific assignee, or a specific notation. It works across paradigms:

* **Imperative** (step‑graphs, SOPs, BPMN),
* **Functional** (pure mappings and compositions, no “steps”),
* **Logical/constraint/optimization** (goals, rules, admissible solutions).

In FPF, a **system** bearing a **TransformerRole** *enacts* a `U.Method` (producing **Work**) by following a **MethodDescription**—an episteme that describes the method in some representation.

## 2 · Problem (what goes wrong without a clean notion of “method”)

1. **Process soup.** “Process” gets used for recipe, execution, schedule, or org area. Planning, staffing, and audit blur together.
2. **Spec = run fallacy.** A flowchart (or code) is taken as if execution already happened; conversely, logs get mistaken for the recipe.
3. **Role leakage.** People encode assignments inside the recipe (“this step is the surgeon”), tying **who** to **how** and making reuse impossible.
4. **Notation lock‑in.** When “method” is defined as “a set of steps,” functional or logical styles become second‑class citizens and cannot be modeled cleanly.

## 3 · Forces (what the definition must balance)

| Force                                  | Tension we resolve                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs. specificity**       | One notion must cover welding, ETL, proofs, and schedulers, while letting each domain keep its idioms.    |
| **Representation vs. semantics**       | Many notations express the same “way of doing”; we need one semantic anchor across specs.                 |
| **Reusability vs. assignment**        | The *how* should be reusable regardless of *who* is assigned this time.                                  |
| **Compositionality vs. executability** | Methods compose (serial/parallel/choice/iteration), but execution may diverge due to conditions/failures. |
| **Determinism vs. search**             | Methods may be deterministic algorithms or constraint problems with admissible solution sets.             |

---

## 4 · Solution — the method as an abstract, paradigm‑agnostic “way of doing”

### 4.1 Definition

**`U.Method`** is a **context‑defined abstract transformation type**—the **semantic “way of doing”** a kind of work.  
It is:
**Described** (never *identical*) by one or more **`U.MethodDescription`** epistemes (code/SOP/diagram/rules),  
**Enacted** by a `U.System` bearing an appropriate **Role** (usually a **TransformerRole**) to produce **`U.Work`**, and  
**Independent** of who is assigned, what instance ran, or which notation was used.

**Strict Distinction (didactic):**  
* ***Method** = *how in principle* (semantic contract).  
* ***MethodDescription** = *how it is written* (artifact on a carrier).  
* ***Work** = *how it actually went this time* (dated execution).

### 4.2 Representation‑agnostic stance (specs may be imperative/functional/logical)

A `U.Method` does **not** require an imperative step structure. **Representations live in `U.MethodDescription`, not in the Method itself.**  
Typical **MethodDescription forms** include:

* **Imperative MethodDescription:** step‑graph/flow (serial/parallel/branch).  
* **Functional MethodDescription:** a composition `f ∘ g ∘ h` with typed interfaces/constraints, no “steps”.  
* **Logical/constraint MethodDescription:** a goal/constraint set with admissible solutions and search/optimization semantics.  
* **Hybrid MethodDescription:** imperative scaffolding with functional kernels and/or solver calls.

**Semantic identity criterion (context‑local).** Two MethodDescriptions **describe the same `U.Method`** in a given `U.BoundedContext` iff, for all admissible inputs and conditions recognized by that context, they entail the **same preconditions**, **guarantee the same postconditions/effects**, and satisfy the **same non‑functional bounds** (allowing permitted non‑determinism). Internal control‑flow/search details may differ.


### 4.3 Method vs MethodDescription vs Work (quick litmus)

| You have in your hand…           | In FPF it is…                 | Why                                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A flowchart/BPMN/SOP text        | **`U.MethodDescription`** (Episteme) | A description on a carrier.                                                     |
| A git repo with code | **`U.MethodDescription`** (Episteme) | Still a description (even if executable). The Method is the semantic “way” it denotes. |
| A log/run report with timestamps | **`U.Work`**                  | A concrete event that happened.                                                 |
| “The way we weld seams type W”   | **`U.Method`**                | The abstract *how*, represented by one or more specs and realized by many runs. |

**Didactic rule:** when referencing *the idea* of “how”, say **Method**; when referencing *the document or code*, say **MethodDescription**; when referencing *the run*, say **Work**.

### 4.4 Interface and effect (conceptual descriptors)

When presenting a `U.Method` in a review, anchor it with these paradigm‑neutral elements (not a data schema):

1. **Interface** — what is required/provided in general (inputs/outputs/types or resources/roles/ports).
2. **Preconditions** — what must already hold (guards, invariants, contract “requires”).
3. **Postconditions / Effects** — what is guaranteed after successful enactment (contract “ensures”).
4. **Non‑functional constraints** — latency, accuracy, cost, safety envelope (ties to **Capability** thresholds).
5. **Failure modes** — known failure classes and recoverability hints.
6. **Compositional hooks** — whether this method composes serially/parallel/choice/iteration (see §4.5).

### 4.5 Method mereology (composition without confusing it with runtime)

Methods compose into bigger methods; executions compose into bigger executions—**do not conflate** the two.

**Method composition (design‑time):** serial (`·`), parallel (`‖`), choice (`|`), iteration (`*`), refinement/substitution—yield **new `U.Method`s**.
**Work composition (run‑time):** the corresponding **Work** may split/merge/overlap differently due to scheduling, failures, or environment, yet it is still **execution of the same Method**.
**Mapping advice:** avoid naming run‑time artifacts inside the method definition (no “this thread”, “this person”); keep those in **Role**/**Work**.

### 4.6 Constructor‑theoretic reading (why Method ≠ algorithm ≠ spec)

Constructor Theory views a **constructor** as a physical entity that **effects transformations**. In FPF:

* A `U.System` with **TransformerRole** is the constructor (the performer).  
* A **`U.Method`** is the abstract **transformation type** it enacts (semantic contract).  
* An **algorithm artifact** is a **`U.MethodDescription`** for an **information‑transformation Method**.  
* A **universal transformer** generalizes the **Turing machine** by **executing any `U.Method` described by a physically admissible `U.MethodDescription`** (not only informational ones).

Thus, welding, milling, reagent mixing, and proof construction are all **Methods**; textbooks/code/derivations are their **MethodDescriptions**; **Work** are the concrete runs.

### 4.7 Context anchoring

`U.Method` is **local to a `U.BoundedContext`**: terminology, admissible pre/postconditions, and non‑functional constraints are interpreted **inside that context**. If two teams or theories use the same name for different “ways of doing,” they are different Methods in different contexts unless bridged explicitly.

---

## 5 · Archetypal grounding (cross-paradigm examples: imperative / functional / logical)

### 5.1 Industrial transformation (imperative flavor)

* **Method:** `Etch_Al2O3`.
* **MethodDescription:** SOP document; a PLC program that controls gas mix and timing.
* **Enactment:** `Tool_42#TransformerRole:FabLine_A` produces **Work** runs W‑101, W‑102….
* **Notes:** Step diagram exists, but a later **functional** spec may also exist (composition of gas‑flow functions). Both **specs** describe the **same Method**.

### 5.2 Operational planning (functional/optimization flavor)

* **Method:** `JS_Schedule_v4` (job‑shop scheduling).
* **MethodDescription:** a MILP model + solver configuration; documentation of constraints/objective.
* **Enactment:** `PlannerService_v4#TransformerRole:PlantScheduling_2025` produces **Work** `Run_2025‑W32‑P1`.
* **Notes:** No “steps” are visible at the method level; the solver’s search is internal. Still a `U.Method`.

### 5.3 Scientific proof (logical flavor)

* **Method:** `Gauss_Elimination`.
* **MethodDescription:** formal rules in a proof assistant; textbook chapter as a second spec.
* **Enactment:** `CAS_Alpha#TransformerRole:MathLab_2025` generates a **Work** proof instance for a concrete matrix.
* **Notes:** The **Episteme** (spec) is not the **ability** (that belongs to the CAS system) and not the **execution** (the proof run).

---

## 6 · Didactic quick grammar (for managers)

* **Who?** `Holder#Role:Context` (**Role assignment**)
* **Can?** `Capability(holder)` within envelope/measures
* **How (in principle)?** **`Method`**, described by **`MethodDescription`**
* **Did?** **`Work`** (execution), linked by `performedBy → RoleAssigning` and `isExecutionOf → MethodDescription`

> *Keep the four words apart and plans become dependable.*

---

## 7 · Bias‑Annotation (as in cluster‑E patterns)

* **Lenses tested:** `Arch`, `Prag`, `Did`, `Epist`.
* **Scope declaration:** Universal; semantics are context‑local via `U.BoundedContext`.
* **Rationale:** Gives FPF a **paradigm‑neutral** “how” that bridges MethodDescription (knowledge on a carrier) and Work (execution), while staying independent of Role (assignment) and Capability (ability).

## 8 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A3.1‑1 (Strict Distinction).**
`U.Method` is the **semantic “way of doing”**. It is **not** a `U.MethodDescription` (artifact on a carrier), **not** a `U.Work` (dated execution), **not** a `U.Role`/assignment, and **not** a `U.Service`/promise.

**CC‑A3.1‑2 (Context anchoring).**
Every `U.Method` **MUST** be defined **within** a `U.BoundedContext`. Identity, admissible pre/postconditions, and non‑functional bounds are interpreted **in that context**.

**CC‑A3.1‑3 (Specification linkage).**
A `U.Method` **SHOULD** be **described by** ≥1 `U.MethodDescription`. For operational gating, at least one `MethodDescription` **MUST** be present and named. Multiple specs may coexist (imperative/functional/logic), see CC‑A3.1‑7.

**CC‑A3.1‑4 (assignment‑free).**
A `U.Method` **SHALL NOT** hard‑code holders or assignments. If a step “needs a surgeon”, express that as a **role requirement** (to be satisfied via `U.RoleAssignment` at run time), not as a named person/unit inside the method.

**CC‑A3.1‑5 (Runtime‑free).**
A `U.Method` **SHALL NOT** contain schedule, calendar slots, or run IDs; those belong to `U.WorkPlan` (plans) and `U.Work` (executions). Methods are timeless.

**CC‑A3.1‑6 (Interface & effects).**
A `U.Method` **MUST** admit a context‑local statement of interface (inputs/outputs or ports/resources), **preconditions**, **postconditions/effects**, and (when relevant) **non‑functional bounds**. These anchor semantic identity beyond a particular notation.

**CC‑A3.1‑7 (Multi‑spec semantic identity).**
Two or more `U.MethodDescription` **describe the same `U.Method`** in a given context **iff** they entail the **same admissible preconditions**, **guarantee the same effects**, and satisfy the **same non‑functional bounds** for all inputs/conditions recognized by that context (allowing permitted non‑determinism). Internal control‑flow/search differences are irrelevant.

**CC‑A3.1‑8 (Composition vs execution).**
Composition of Methods (design‑time) and composition of Work (run‑time) **MUST** be kept distinct. Method composition yields **new Methods**; Work composition yields **composed executions**. They may correspond but are not identical.

**CC‑A3.1‑9 (Parameterization).**
If a Method is parameterized, parameters are **declared** at the Method/MethodDescription level; **concrete values** are bound **at `U.Work` creation**. Avoid freezing parameter values inside the Method definition.

**CC‑A3.1‑10 (Dynamics ≠ Method).**
Laws/trajectories (`U.Dynamics`) are models of state evolution and **SHALL NOT** be labeled as Methods. A Method **may** rely on a Dynamics model (e.g., for control), but they remain distinct artifacts/concepts.

**CC‑A3.1‑11 (Capability checks are orthogonal).**
A step may impose capability thresholds; those thresholds are checked **against the holder’s `U.Capability`** independently of assignment and independently of the Method’s description.

**CC‑A3.1‑12 (Constructor‑theoretic alignment).**
Algorithm artifacts are `U.MethodDescription` for information‑transforming Methods. Physical Methods are equally valid (matter/energy transformations). A “universal transformer” is a system that can enact **any physically admissible MethodDescription**; this does **not** collapse Method into “algorithm.”

---

## 9 · Method mereology (composition) — design‑time only

**Operators (conceptual, context‑scoped):**

* **Serial composition (`·`)** — do A then B → `A · B` is a new Method.
* **Parallel composition (`‖`)** — do A and B concurrently (with declared independence/joins).
* **Choice (`|`)** — do **one** of {A, B} under guard/selector.
* **Iteration (`*`)** — repeat A under a loop invariant/termination condition.
* **Refinement (`≤ₘ`)** — Method M' preserves M’s interface/effects and **strengthens** preconditions or **tightens** non‑functional bounds (context‑defined lattice).
* **Substitution** — replace a Method factor with a semantically equivalent one (`M ≡ N` in context) without changing the whole’s contract.

**Design‑time laws (intuitive, not mechanized here):**

* Associativity for `·` and, where admissible, for `‖`.
* Distributivity over guarded choice under context rules.
* Identity elements (e.g., `Skip` that preserves state and satisfies neutral bounds).
* Monotonicity: refinement of a factor **should not** break the whole’s postconditions.

**Run‑time mapping (do not conflate):**
`U.Work` instances of `A · B` **may** interleave differently due to scheduling or failure‑handling and still be executions of `A · B`. The mapping is “execution semantics,” not part of Method mereology.

## 10 · How Methods interact with Roles, Capability, Work, Dynamics (manager’s view)

* **Roles (assignment).** Steps stipulate **role kinds** (e.g., `IncisionOperatorRole`), not people. At run time, `U.Work` references a **`U.RoleAssignment`** that satisfies the role kind.
* **Capability (ability).** Steps may require **thresholds** (e.g., “precision ≤ 0.2 mm”). They are checked against the **holder’s `U.Capability`** in the context/envelope.
* **Work (execution).** Each run records `isExecutionOf → MethodDescription` (the spec used) and `performedBy → RoleAssigning`. Logs, resources, and timestamps live here.
* **Dynamics (laws/models).** Methods may cite or assume a Dynamics model; runs may attach traces that are explained by that model. Do not label the model itself as the Method.

---

## 11 · Anti‑patterns (and the right move)

* **Spec = Method.** “The BPMN is the Method.” → The BPMN is a **MethodDescription**; the **Method** is the semantic way it denotes.
* **Run = Method.** “Yesterday’s process is our Method.” → Yesterday’s run is **Work**.
* **Role leakage.** “Step 3 is done by Alice.” → Step 3 **requires** `SurgeonRole`; Alice may be assigned via **RoleAssigning**.
* **Schedule leakage.** “Run at 02:00 daily” inside the Method. → This belongs to **WorkPlan**; Methods are timeless.
* **BoM entanglement.** Putting parts/assemblies inside Method definition. → Structure stays in PBS/SBS; Method references **interfaces/resources**, not a BoM.
* **Algorithm‑only bias.** Declaring that only code counts as a Method. → Physical transformations (welding, mixing) are Methods too; their SOPs/parameters are MethodDescriptions.
* **Hard‑coding capability.** Baking “≤ 0.2 mm” into a role name or Method name. → Keep thresholds on **steps**; **capability** lives on the **holder**.

---

## 12 · Migration notes (quick wins)

1. **Rename wisely.** Where texts say “process/method” but mean a diagram or code repo, label it **MethodDescription**; where they mean the abstract “how,” label it **Method**.
2. **Extract assignments.** Replace named people/units in specs with **role kinds**; enforce assignments via **RoleAssigning** at run time.
3. **Pull time out.** Move calendars/schedules from specs into **WorkPlan**.
4. **Parameter hygiene.** Declare parameters at Method/MethodDescription; bind values in **Work**.
5. **Equivalence notes.** When two specs are intended as the same Method, write an **equivalence note** in the context (pre/post/bounds parity).

## 13 · Consequences

| Benefits                                                                                                                    | Trade‑offs / mitigations                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clarity across paradigms.** Methods are first‑class regardless of notation; teams stop arguing step‑vs‑functional.        | **One more name to learn.** Use the quick grammar card; it pays off fast.                          |
| **Reuse without personnel lock‑in.** assignment moves to RoleAssigning; Methods remain portable.                             | **Extra role tables.** Keep role‑kind lists short and context‑local.                               |
| **Robust audits.** Logs are Work, specs are MethodDescription, contracts are Method; no more “we thought the diagram was the run.” | **Discipline needed.** Enforce the three‑way split in reviews.                                     |
| **Constructor‑theoretic coherence.** Physical and informational transformations are peers.                                  | **Cultural shift.** Not every team is used to seeing SOPs and code as the same class (MethodDescription). |

* **Keep time and people out:** Schedules → **WorkPlan**; assignees → **RoleAssigning**.

# A.3.2 — U.MethodDescription  \[D]


## 1 · Context (plain‑language motivation)

Projects need a **stable way to express “how it is written”**—the recipe, code, SOP, rule set, or formal proof—**without confusing it** with:

* the **semantic “way of doing”** (that is `U.Method`),
* the **assignment** (that is `U.RoleAssignment`),
* the **ability** (that is `U.Capability`),
* the **execution** (that is `U.Work`), or
* the **calendar plan** (that is `U.WorkPlan`).

`U.MethodDescription` gives this anchor. It treats **algorithms, programs, proofs, SOPs, BPMN diagrams, solver models, playbooks** as **one class of epistemes**: *knowledge on a carrier that describes a Method*. This unifies software and “paper” procedures and lets teams switch notations without breaking the model.

---

## 2 · Problem (what breaks without a clear `MethodDescription`)

1. **Spec/run conflation.** A flowchart or code is mistaken for the run; audits and SLOs become unreliable.
2. **Who/time leakage.** People and calendars creep into the recipe; reuse and staffing agility die.
3. **Step‑only bias.** Functional or logical styles are treated as “not real methods”; designs get contorted into faux steps.
4. **Algorithm‑centrism.** Only code is considered “the method”, leaving SOPs and scientific procedures second‑class.
5. **Structure entanglement.** BoM/PBS elements end up inside the recipe; method and product structure tangle.
6. **Unstated equivalence.** Two specs intended to mean “the same method” are not declared equivalent; teams fork semantics by accident.

## 4 · Solution — the specification as an episteme describing a Method

### 4.1 Definition

**`U.MethodDescription`** is an **`U.Episteme`** that **describes a `U.Method`** in a concrete representation (text, code, diagram, model). It is **knowledge on a carrier** that can be reviewed and validated; at run-time a **`U.System`** **uses it to execute the `U.Method` as `U.Work` under a `U.RoleAssignment`**.

> **Strict Distinction (memory aid):**
> **Method** = *how in principle* (semantic contract).
> **MethodDescription** = *how it is written* (artifact/description).
> **Work** = *how it went this time* (dated execution).

### 4.2 Representation‑agnostic stance (independent of “algorithmic paradigm”)

`U.MethodDescription` **does not privilege any single notation**. Typical forms include (non‑exhaustive):

* **Imperative Spec** — SOP, BPMN/flowchart, PLC ladder, shell/pipeline scripts.
* **Functional Spec** — compositions of pure functions, typed pipelines, category‑style combinators.
* **Logical/Constraint Spec** — rules/goal sets, SAT/SMT/MILP models, theorem‑prover scripts.
* **Statistical/ML Spec** — model definitions, training/evaluation procedures, inference pipelines.
* **Reactive/Event‑driven Spec** — statecharts, observers/triggers, stream/CEP rules.
* **Hybrid Spec** — mixtures (e.g., imperative orchestration calling solver kernels).

**Same Method, different MethodDescriptions.** In a single `U.BoundedContext`, several MethodDescriptions **may describe the same `U.Method`** if they entail the **same preconditions**, **guarantee the same effects**, and meet the **same non‑functional bounds** (cf. A.3.1).

### 4.3 What a good MethodDescription states (paradigm‑neutral content)

Not a schema—these are **content prompts** for reviewers:

1. **Purpose & Name of the Method** it describes (link to `U.Method`).
2. **Interface/ports** (inputs/outputs/resources/contracts) in the context’s vocabulary.
3. **Preconditions** (guards, invariants, required states).
4. **Postconditions / Effects** (what is guaranteed upon success).
5. **Non‑functional constraints** (latency, precision, cost, safety envelope).
6. **Role requirements** for enactment (**kinds**, not people)—to be satisfied at run time via **`U.RoleAssignment`**.
7. **Capability thresholds** the performer must meet (checked against **`U.Capability`** of the holder).
8. **Failure semantics** (detectable failures, compensations, rollback/forward strategies).
9. **Compositional hooks** (how this spec composes: serial/parallel/choice/iteration), without embedding calendars.
10. **Parameter declarations** (what may vary per run; values bound at `U.Work` creation).

> **Didactic guardrail:** A MethodDescription **does not** embed a schedule, assignees, or BoM. Calendars → `U.WorkPlan`; people/units → `U.RoleAssignment`; product structure → PBS/SBS.

### 4.4 Epistemic roles for MethodDescriptions (via `U.RoleAssignment`)

Being an Episteme, a MethodDescription may itself play epistemic roles via `U.RoleAssignment` in a context (classification, not action), e.g.:

* `ApprovedProcedureRole`, `RegulatedProcedureRole`, `SafetyCriticalProcedureRole`, `De‑factoStandardRole`.
* These **do not** make the spec an actor; they classify its **status** within the context (who may use it, in which settings).

### 4.5 Constructor‑theoretic note (unifying “algorithms” and “physical recipes”)

In the constructor‑theoretic reading used by FPF:

* **Algorithms, programs, solver models, proofs** are all **`U.MethodDescription`**—descriptions of Methods that transform **information**.
* **SOPs, control recipes, lab protocols** are **`U.MethodDescription`**—descriptions of Methods that transform **matter/energy**.
* A **universal transformer** (a system with sufficient capability) enacts **any physically admissible MethodDescription**—not only informational ones.

This keeps software and “wet lab” on equal footing.

## 5 · Clear distinctions (quick litmus for managers)

| You are holding…                          | It is…                         | Why                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| A BPMN diagram or SOP                     | **`U.MethodDescription`**             | A description on a carrier.                   |
| A git repo or compiled binary             | **`U.MethodDescription`**             | Still a description (even if executable).     |
| “The way we do X in principle”            | **`U.Method`**                 | Semantic contract beyond any single notation. |
| A run log with timestamps                 | **`U.Work`**                   | A dated execution event.                      |
| A role description (“surgeon”, “planner”) | **`U.Role` / `U.RoleAssignment`** | assignment, not recipe.                      |
| “Can achieve ±0.2 mm”                     | **`U.Capability`**             | Ability of a holder, not a spec.              |
| A calendar for next week’s runs           | **`U.WorkPlan`**               | Plan/schedule, not a recipe.                  |
| A state‑transition law                    | **`U.Dynamics`**               | Model of evolution, not a method description. |

## 6 · Archetypal grounding (parallel cases)

### 6.1 Industrial SOP (imperative)

* **Method:** `Etch_Al2O3`.
* **MethodDescription:** `SOP_Etch_v7.pdf` + PLC ladder file.
* **Role requirements:** `EtchOperatorRole`; **Capability:** gas‑control precision ≤ threshold.
* **Execution:** `Tool_42#TransformerRole:Fab_A` enacts the spec → **Work** runs W‑143…W‑155.

### 6.2 Optimization model (logical/constraint)

* **Method:** `JS_Schedule_v4`.
* **MethodDescription:** MILP model + solver config; admissible solution definition.
* **Execution:** `PlannerService_v4#TransformerRole:Plant_2025` produces **Work** `Run_2025‑W32‑P1`.

### 6.3 Clinical guideline (epistemic, status via RoleStateGraph + State Assertion)

* **Method:** `AcuteAppendicitis_Triage`.
* **MethodDescription:** clinical decision rule set; **Epistemic Role**: `RegulatedProcedureRole:Hospital_Context`.
* **Execution:** `ER_Team#TransformerRole:ER_Shift` enacts the spec on a case → **Work** visit V‑8842.

---

## 7 · Bias‑Annotation (as in E‑cluster)

* **Lenses tested:** `Did`, `Prag`, `Arch`, `Epist`.
* **Scope declaration:** Universal; semantics are **context‑local** via `U.BoundedContext`.
* **Rationale:** Elevates **all** procedural artifacts—code, SOPs, proofs, models—to a single class, avoiding algorithm‑centrism and step‑only bias. Keeps the strict split among **Method / MethodDescription / Work / Role / Capability**.

## 8 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A3.2‑1 (Episteme status).**
`U.MethodDescription` **IS** an `U.Episteme` (knowledge on a carrier). It is **not** a `U.Method` (semantic way), **not** a `U.Work` (execution), **not** a `U.Role/RoleAssigning` (assignment), **not** a `U.WorkPlan` (schedule), and **not** PBS/SBS content.

**CC‑A3.2‑2 (Context anchoring).**
Every `U.MethodDescription` **MUST** be interpreted **within** a `U.BoundedContext`. Names, contracts, and admissible non‑functional bounds are **local** to that context.

**CC‑A3.2‑3 (Method linkage).**
A `U.MethodDescription` **MUST** declare the `U.Method` it describes. Multiple MethodDescriptions **MAY** describe the same Method (see CC‑A3.2‑8).

**CC‑A3.2‑4 (assignment/time‑free).**
A MethodDescription **SHALL NOT** embed assignees, org units, or calendars. People/units are bound via **`U.RoleAssignment`** at run time; calendars belong to **`U.WorkPlan`**.

**CC‑A3.2‑5 (Structure‑free).**
BoM/PBS/SBS artifacts **SHALL NOT** be embedded in MethodDescriptions. Reference **interfaces/resources** and constraints instead of listing parts/assemblies.

**CC‑A3.2‑6 (Role and capability requirements).**
A MethodDescription **MAY** state **role kinds** and **capability thresholds** required for enactment. These are **requirements**, not bindings. They are checked at run time against `U.RoleAssignment` and `U.Capability`.

**CC‑A3.2‑7 (Parameterization).**
Parameters **MUST** be **declared** in the Method/MethodDescription; concrete values are **bound** when creating `U.Work`. Default values in a spec are allowed but **SHALL NOT** force a schedule or assignee.

**CC‑A3.2‑8 (Semantic equivalence).**
Two MethodDescriptions **describe the same `U.Method`** in a given context **iff** they entail the **same preconditions**, **guarantee the same postconditions/effects**, and satisfy the **same non‑functional bounds** for all admissible inputs/conditions of that context (per A.3.1 CC‑A3.1‑7). Differences in control flow, search, or notation do **not** break equivalence.

**CC‑A3.2‑9 (Refinement).**
`Spec₂` **refines** `Spec₁` for the same Method iff it **preserves interface**, **does not weaken** postconditions/effects, and **tightens** (or equal) non‑functional bounds under **equal or stronger** preconditions. Declare refinement explicitly in the context.

**CC‑A3.2‑10 (Compatibility claims).**
Claims such as “sound but incomplete” or “complete but potentially unsound” relative to another MethodDescription **MUST** be stated explicitly and scoped to the context (e.g., solver approximations).

**CC‑A3.2‑11 (Executable specs).**
Executability does **not** change status: an executable artifact (program, script) is still a **MethodDescription**. Its runs are **Work**; its semantics are the **Method** it denotes.

**CC‑A3.2‑12 (Epistemic roles via `U.RoleAssignment`).**
A MethodDescription **MAY** play **epistemic roles** via `U.RoleAssignment` (e.g., `ApprovedProcedureRole`, `RegulatedProcedureRole`) that classify its status. Such bindings **do not** make the spec an actor.

**CC‑A3.2‑13 (Non‑determinism declaration).**
If a MethodDescription permits non‑determinism (e.g., search/optimization), the **space of admissible outcomes** and **acceptance criteria** **MUST** be stated (so that Work can be judged).

**CC‑A3.2‑14 (Bridging across contexts).**
If two contexts use different MethodDescriptions for “the same‑named way,” an explicit **Bridge (`U.Alignment`)** **SHOULD** be provided to map terms/assumptions. Do **not** assume cross‑context identity by name alone.

---

## 9 · MethodDescription mereology (epistemic composition; not method composition)

Keep two worlds separate:

* **Method composition (design‑time semantic):** combines Methods into **new Methods** (A.3.1 §9).
* **MethodDescription mereology (epistemic):** combines **documents/code/models** into larger **spec artifacts**. This is about **parts of the description**, not about the semantic method algebra.

**Epistemic part relations (illustrative):**

* **`ConstituentOf`** — a chapter/module/snippet is a constituent of a larger spec.
* **`Imports/Uses`** — this spec reuses a library/rule set.
* **`VariantOf`** — this spec is a variant (e.g., for different equipment) with declared deltas.
* **`RepresentationOf`** — this visual diagram is a representation of the textual rule set.

**Didactic rule:** Do not infer that a spec with two modules **means** a Method with “two steps.” Modules are **parts of the description**, not necessarily steps of the Method.

---

## 10 · Parameterization & variability (templates, defaults, configs)

**Templates.** A MethodDescription may serve as a **template** with parameters (e.g., temperature set‑points, solver tolerances, objective weights).

**Binding time.**

* **Declare** parameters in the spec;
* **Bind** values when creating `U.Work` (or at an agreed “compile” stage);
* Keep bound values **visible** in the Work record (so runs can be compared).

**Defaults and guards.**

* Defaults are allowed; list **valid ranges** and **guards** (e.g., safety constraints).
* If a default has safety impact, state it explicitly as part of **preconditions**.

**Variants.**

* When variants differ only by **parameter ranges** → keep one Method with one MethodDescription template.
* When variants differ by **contract** (effects/bounds) → either declare a **refinement** or introduce a **distinct Method** (context decision).

---

## 11 · Equivalence & compatibility (across notations and contexts)

**Within one context.**

* Use **semantic equivalence** (CC‑A3.2‑8) to assert that BPMN vs code vs solver model are the **same Method**.
* Prefer a short **equivalence note** showing parity of pre/post/bounds.

**Across contexts.**

* Treat identity as **not guaranteed**.
* Provide **Bridges (`U.Alignment`)** that map terms, units, roles, and acceptance criteria.
* Be explicit if one spec is only **sound** (never returns forbidden outcomes) vs **complete** (can return all allowed outcomes).

**Observational perspective (pragmatic).**
Two specs are observationally equivalent for stakeholders **if**, under declared conditions, they are indistinguishable by the acceptance tests of that context (even if internal strategies differ).

---

## 12 · Anti‑patterns (and the right move)

* **Spec = run.** “Yesterday’s process log is our spec.” → The log is **Work**; write a **MethodDescription** and link runs to it.
* **Who/time in the spec.** “Step 3 by Alice at 02:00 daily.” → Use **RoleAssigning** at run time; schedule via **WorkPlan**.
* **Stuffing BoM.** Listing parts/assemblies inside the spec. → Reference **interfaces/resources**; keep PBS/SBS separate.
* **Algorithm‑only bias.** Treating code as “real spec” and SOPs as “notes.” → Both are **MethodDescription**; judge by contracts, not by format.
* **Hiding non‑determinism.** Solver model with no acceptance criteria. → Declare admissible outcome set and tests.
* **Silent parameter capture.** Hard‑coding values without declaring parameters. → Declare parameters with ranges; bind at Work creation.
* **Undeclared variant drift.** Copy‑pasting specs and tweaking silently. → Use **VariantOf** with stated deltas or declare a refinement.

---

## 13 · Migration notes (quick wins)

1. **Label the artifacts.** Wherever a repo/diagram/document “is the process,” rename it **MethodDescription** and link it to a named **Method**.
2. **Extract people and calendars.** Move all assignees to **RoleAssigning** and all schedules to **WorkPlan**.
3. **Introduce parameter blocks.** Add a small “Parameters” section with ranges/defaults and safety guards.
4. **Write acceptance criteria.** Especially for search/optimization or ML specs.
5. **Declare equivalence/refinement.** Where two notations intend “the same way,” add an **equivalence note**; where the new one tightens bounds, declare **refinement**.
6. **Bridge domains.** If two departments use different vocabularies, add a **Bridge (`U.Alignment`)** rather than forcing a single spec.

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One class for all recipes.** SOPs, code, models, proofs become peers; teams can choose the best notation.       | **A bit more ceremony.** You name the Method and the MethodDescription separately; the payoff is clarity. |
| **Cleaner audits.** Specs vs runs vs assignments vs abilities never mix.                                         | **Discipline required.** Keep schedules and people out of specs.                                   |
| **Easier reuse and substitution.** Equivalence/refinement rules enable swapping notations without semantic drift. | **Equivalence is a claim.** Back it with short acceptance tests.                                   |
| **Cross‑domain coherence.** Bridges allow controlled translation between contexts.                                | **Bridge maintenance.** Someone owns the mapping; keep it short and focused.                       |

* **Coordinates with:** A.2 `U.Role`, A.2.1 `U.RoleAssignment` (who enacts it); A.2.2 `U.Capability` (ability thresholds); A.15 Role–Method–Work (linking `isExecutionOf` to runs).
* **Informs:** `U.WorkPlan` (plans reference MethodDescriptions); `U.Dynamics` (models that specs may assume); Epistemic Role patterns (status of specs RoleStateGraph + State Assertion).
* **Lexical guards:** E.10.y **L‑PROC** (do not call MethodDescription “process” when you mean Work/WorkPlan); E.10.x **L‑FUNC** (avoid “function/functionality” confusion).

## 16 · Didactic quick cards

* **Spec ≠ Method ≠ Work.** *Written recipe* ≠ *semantic way* ≠ *dated execution*.
* **Keep people/time out.** Assignees → **RoleAssigning**; schedules → **WorkPlan**.
* **Declare parameters & acceptance.** Bind values at Work; state how success is judged.
* **Same method, different specs.** BPMN/code/solver can be equivalent **if** pre/post/bounds match.
* **Bridge, do not blur.** Cross‑team/domain differences go through **`U.Alignment`**, not wishful thinking.
  
## A.3.3 · `U.Dynamics` \[D]

### 1 · Context

Teams need one place to say **how a thing changes**. Physicists call this “dynamics” (equations of motion, state‑transition maps). In IT and enterprise change, we often talk about **evolution of characteristics** (latency, cost, reliability, compliance, architectural fitness) across time. In knowledge work, **KD‑CAL** (knowledge dynamics) reasons about how the **status of claims** shifts as evidence arrives. All these are *the same modeling need*: a context‑local description of **state space** and **allowed transitions**.

FPF already separates:

* **what a holon is** (structure, PBS/SBS),
* **how we act** (Method/MethodDescription, Work),
* **what we promise** (Service).

What is missing without `U.Dynamics` is the **law of change**—the model that tells us how states evolve **with or without** our interventions.

> Intuition: **Method** tells an agent what to do; **Dynamics** tells everyone how the world (or a model of it) changes when something happens (or even when nothing happens).

**Lexical note.** Terms like *process* and *thermodynamic process* are mapped by **L‑PROC**:

* the **recipe** is `U.Method/MethodDescription`,
* the **dated run** is `U.Work`,
* the **law/trajectory model** is `U.Dynamics`.

---

### 2 · Problem

Without a first‑class `U.Dynamics`, models suffer predictable failures:

1. **Recipe = Law.** Teams put the *procedure* (Method/MethodDescription) where the *state law* should be, so simulations and predictions become impossible to compare with reality.
2. **Run = Law.** Logs of Work are mistaken for dynamics; past events are treated as if they defined what *must* happen.
3. **No state space.** Discussions jump between metrics (latency! throughput!) without an explicit **characteristic space** or invariants, so “improvements” cannot be reasoned about.
4. **Domain lock‑in.** “Dynamics” is left to domain vocabularies (physics, control, finance), losing a trans‑disciplinary way to speak about change in a single kernel.

### 4 · Solution — The unified concept `U.Dynamics`

**Definition (normative).**
Within a `U.BoundedContext`, **`U.Dynamics`** is an **`U.Episteme` that specifies a state space and a state‑transition law** (deterministic or stochastic, continuous/discrete/hybrid) for one or more holons, possibly under exogenous inputs and constraints. It **does not** prescribe what an agent should do (that is `U.Method/MethodDescription`) and **is not** the dated evolution itself (that is `U.Work` evidence).

* **Type:** `U.Episteme` (design‑time model/law on a carrier).
* **Orientation:** descriptive/predictive about **how states evolve**; can be used by Methods but remains separate from them.
* **Judged by:** conformance of observed **Work‑derived traces** to the law and invariants.

#### 4.1 · Core structure (minimal fields)

```
U.Dynamics {
  context        : U.BoundedContext,     // where the model’s meaning and units are defined
  stateSpace     : CharacteristicSpace,  // explicit characteristics & units; may include topology/geometry
  transitionLaw  : Episteme,             // equations/relations/kernels/transition matrices/rules
  timeBase       : {continuous|discrete|hybrid},
  stochasticity? : {deterministic|stochastic}, // incl. noise/likelihood model if stochastic
  inputs?        : P(Characteristic),    // control/disturbances/environmental drivers
  observation?   : Episteme,             // measurement/observation map from state to observables
  constraints?   : Episteme,             // invariants/safety envelopes/guards
  validity?      : Conditions,           // operating region, approximations, version, timespan
  calibration?   : Episteme              // parameter identification / priors
}
```

* **`stateSpace`** uses FPF **characteristics** (not “characteristics”) so we can talk about **architecture fitness** (e.g., latency, MTBF, cost) just like temperature/pressure/volume in physics.
* **`transitionLaw`** is paradigm‑agnostic: ODE/PDE, finite‑state relation, Petri net firing, queueing kernel, Bayesian update, etc.
* **`observation`** separates what exists from what we *measure* (key for monitoring/assurance).

#### 4.2 · What `U.Dynamics` is **not**

* **Not a Method/MethodDescription:** no imperative steps or prescriptions.
* **Not Work:** no timestamps/resources attached; evidence lives on `U.Work`.
* **Not a Service:** no consumer promise; dynamics may underpin service SLOs but does not define the promise.
* **Not PBS/SBS:** do not place dynamics inside structural BoMs.

---

### 5 · Where `U.Dynamics` sits in enactment

* **Design‑time:**
  Methods may *reference* Dynamics for planning/control (e.g., MPC uses a plant model).
  Services may *derive* acceptance targets from Dynamics (e.g., queueing predictions → SLO).

* **Run‑time:**
  Work produces **state samples/telemetry**; applying the **observation** map yields traces.
  Conformance/violation is decided by comparing traces with **constraints** and predictions from the transition law.
  Updates to model parameters flow via **calibration** (design‑time again).

> Memory hook: **Method decides**, **Dynamics predicts**, **Work reveals**.

### Prediction Use In Gating (normative)

When **predicted** coordinates (from a dynamics model) are used for **comparison or gating**, one of the following **MUST** hold:
1) a **fresh observation** is available for the gate’s window; or
2) the applied flow/map `Φ_{Δt}` is proven **non‑expansive** (Lipschitz ≤ 1) under the declared distance overlay (see § 5.1.7), **and** it **commutes** with the invariantization step (§ 5.1.6) — i.e., `Quot/Fix_g ∘ Φ_{Δt} = Φ_{Δt} ∘ Quot/Fix_g` on the domain of use.

If neither condition is satisfied, using prediction for gating is **forbidden**; the system **MUST** fall back to observation. Any use of `Φ_{Δt}` **SHALL** declare its validity window (range, Δt).

**Key takeaway:** one kernel object captures **trajectories in a characteristic space**, from thermodynamics to software quality and knowledge confidence.

## 7 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A3.3‑1 (Type).**
`U.Dynamics` **IS** an `U.Episteme` (design‑time model/law on a carrier). It is **not** a `U.Method/MethodDescription`, **not** `U.Work`, and **not** a structural part of any PBS/SBS.

**CC‑A3.3‑2 (Context).**
Every `U.Dynamics` **MUST** be declared **inside** a `U.BoundedContext`. Units, characteristic names, admissible regions, and time base are **local to the context**; cross‑context reuse requires a Bridge (`U.Alignment`).

**CC‑A3.3‑3 (Explicit state space).**
`stateSpace` **MUST** enumerate characteristics with units/scales (continuous/discrete/ordinal) and any topology/geometry needed for trajectories. Do **not** refer to informal “axes”.

**CC‑A3.3‑4 (Transition law).**
`transitionLaw` **MUST** specify a state‑transition relation/map/kernel suitable for the declared time base (`continuous|discrete|hybrid`) and stochasticity (deterministic or with a likelihood/noise model).

**CC‑A3.3‑5 (Observation model).**
If evidence from `U.Work` is to be checked against the law, an `observation` mapping **MUST** be provided (identity is acceptable only if explicitly stated). Sampling rate/granularity **SHOULD** be declared.

**CC‑A3.3‑6 (Constraints & validity).**
If safety/envelope constraints apply, they **MUST** be declared under `constraints`. Operating region, approximations, version, and `timespan` **SHOULD** be stated under `validity`.

**CC‑A3.3‑7 (Separation from Method).**
A `U.Dynamics` **SHALL NOT** prescribe imperative steps or responsibilities. Planning/control algorithms that *use* the dynamics belong to `U.Method/MethodDescription`.

**CC‑A3.3‑8 (No actuals on Dynamics).**
Resource/time **actuals** and telemetry **MUST** attach to `U.Work`. Calibration outcomes produce **new versions** of `U.Dynamics`; the law object itself carries no run‑time logs.

**CC‑A3.3‑9 (Multi‑scale declaration).**
If state is aggregated across parts or time, the aggregation policy (`Γ_time`, `Γ_work`, averaging vs. sum vs. percentile) **MUST** be stated to prevent incoherent comparisons.

**CC‑A3.3‑10 (Lexical hygiene).**
Ambiguous uses of *process/processual* (laws vs. runs vs. recipes) **MUST** be resolved per **L‑PROC**/**L‑ACT**:

* law → `U.Dynamics`,
* recipe → `U.Method/MethodDescription`,
* run → `U.Work`.

**CC‑A3.3‑11 (Link to Services—optional).**
If Service SLOs are derived from a dynamics model, the Service **SHOULD** reference that `U.Dynamics` (A.2.3), but the Service remains the promise, not the law.

## 8 · Evidence and operators (traces, prediction, conformance)

Let `D` be a `U.Dynamics` in context `C`. Let `W` be a set of `U.Work` records produced under `C`. Let `obs_D(·)` be the declared observation map for `D`.

### 8.1 Derived evidence

* **`trace(W, D)` → Sequence\<t, y>:**
  derive an ordered sequence of observed values `y` at times `t` by applying `obs_D` to Work/telemetry associated with `W`. (Not a kernel type; a derived artifact for analysis/assurance.)

* **`inputs(W)` → Series:**
  exogenous inputs/control signals recovered from Work metadata if the model declares `inputs`.

* **`initialState(W, D)` → x₀:**
  the assumed/estimated state at trace start (from Work context or a stated estimation rule).

### 8.2 Prediction & simulation

* **`predict(D, x₀, inputs?, horizon)` → Trajectory:**
  propagate the law to obtain a predicted trajectory in the declared state space.

* **`admissible(D, x)` → bool:**
  test whether state `x` satisfies `constraints`.

* **`reach(D, S₀, S₁, inputs?, horizon)` → bool:**
  reachability: can states in `S₀` evolve into `S₁` under the law.

### 8.3 Conformance & drift

* **`residuals(D, trace)` → Series:**
  discrepancies between predicted and observed series under a stated alignment (point‑wise, windowed, distributional).

* **`fits(D, trace, tol)` → {pass|fail|partial}:**
  verdict under tolerance policy `tol` defined by the context (e.g., sup‑norm ≤ ε, percentile bands, likelihood threshold).

* **`drift(D₁, D₂, domain)` → Measure:**
  divergence between two model versions over a declared operating domain (e.g., max deviation of eigenvalues, KL between predictive distributions).

### 8.4 Invariants

* `fits(D, trace, tol)=pass` ⇒ every sample lies in `admissible(D,·)` unless the context explicitly permits out‑of‑envelope transients.
* If two traces are generated under identical `inputs` and initial conditions, recorded differences must be explainable by the declared stochasticity/noise model or flagged as violations.

> **Didactic hook:** *Dynamics predicts; Work reveals; Conformance compares.*

---

## 9 · Anti‑patterns (and the right move)

* **“Dynamics = procedure.”**
  Control recipes/step graphs belong to `Method/MethodDescription`. Keep the law in `U.Dynamics`.

* **“Telemetry = dynamics.”**
  Logs are `Work` evidence. Build `trace(Work, D)` and compare to the law; do not store logs inside the law.

* **“No state space.”**
  KPI lists without an explicit `stateSpace` turn into dashboard folklore. Name characteristics with units and ranges.

* **“Hard‑coding SLO inside the law.”**
  Service targets are promises (`U.Service.acceptanceSpec`). Keep predictions and promises separate; link them.

* **“Stuffing Dynamics into BoM.”**
  A model is not a component. Leave PBS/SBS for structure.

* **“One size fits all time base.”**
  If parts of the system evolve on different clocks, declare `hybrid` and separate update rules.

---

## 10 · Migration notes (quick path to value)

1. **Name the changing things.** Pick 3–7 **characteristics** that matter (physical or architectural). Declare `stateSpace` with units and ranges.
2. **Write the law you already use.** Even if it is a queueing approximation or a simple ARIMA—put it under `transitionLaw` and state assumptions under `validity`.
3. **Separate recipe from law.** Move control procedures to `Method/MethodDescription`; keep forecasting/plant equations in `U.Dynamics`.
4. **Wire evidence.** Ensure production `Work` emits the measurements needed by `observation`. Build `trace(Work, D)`.
5. **Start conformance.** Define a simple `tol` and compute `fits(D, trace, tol)` weekly. Raise issues on drift; version the model when calibrating.
6. **Link to promises (optional).** If SLOs depend on the law, reference `U.Dynamics` from `U.Service` and derive targets transparently.
7. **For KD‑CAL.** Treat belief/support as characteristics; declare a Bayesian/likelihood update in `transitionLaw`; evaluate conformance against evidence arrivals.

## 11 · Relations

* **Builds on:**
  `A.1.1 U.BoundedContext` (local meaning/units),
  `A.2 Role` / `A.2.1 RoleAssigning` (agents that *use* the law),
  `A.15.1 U.Work` (run‑time evidence).

* **Coordinates with:**
  `A.3.1 U.Method` / `A.3.2 U.MethodDescription` (planning/control using the law),
  `A.2.3 U.Service` (promises informed by predictions),
  **KD‑CAL** (knowledge dynamics as a specialisation: belief‑update laws),
  **Resrc‑CAL** (cost/energy models as dynamics over resources).

* **Constrained by lexical rules:**
  **E.10 L‑PROC** (process disambiguation), **L‑ACT** (activity/action), **L‑FUNC** (function).

## 12 · Didactic quick cards (engineer‑manager ready)

* **Dynamics = Law of Change.** A design‑time model of how states evolve.
* **State space = Named characteristics with units.** No vague “axes”.
* **Method vs Dynamics.** Method decides *what we do*; Dynamics predicts *what will happen*.
* **Work = Evidence.** Only Work has timestamps and resource actuals.
* **Conformance = Prediction vs Trace.** Fit, residuals, drift.
* **Keep promises separate.** Services are promises; Dynamics informs them but does not replace them.

**Memory hook:** **Method decides · Dynamics predicts · Work reveals.**

## A.4  Temporal Duality & Open‑Ended Evolution Principle \[A] 

*“A holon is born in design‑time, lives in run‑time,  
and is reborn when the world talks back.”*

### Context  
A holon’s **blueprint** and its **lived reality** are never identical for
long.  Pumps wear out, theories meet anomalous data, workflows face
unanticipated load.  FPF therefore requires a temporal framework that:

1. Physically grounds every modification (via the Transformer Principle,
   A 3).  
2. Supports unbounded improvement cycles (**P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution**).  
3. Works identically for physical, epistemic, operational (method, work) and future
   holon flavours.

### Problem  

| Failure mode | Consequence |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Blueprint ≡ Reality** | “As‑built” discrepancies remain invisible; safety and validity claims become fiction. |
| **Implicit magic updates** | Versions overwrite each other; provenance chains snap. |
| **Observer special‑case** | Measurement treated as metaphysical rather than a normal, physically grounded transformation. |

### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Stability vs Change** | Identify a holon across time ↔ allow radical redesigns. |
| **Prediction vs Evidence** | Plan with intended specs ↔ respond to real telemetry. |
| **Parsimony vs Expressiveness** | Keep the model lean ↔ respect the full lifecycle complexity. |

---

### Solution · Temporal Duality Model  

FPF assigns every holon state to one—and only one—of two **temporal
scopes**:

| Scope | Symbol | Definition | Typical contents |
|-------|--------|------------|------------------|
| **Design‑Time** | *Tᴰ* | Interval(s) during which the holon **may be structurally altered** by an *external* `Transformer` executing a `U.TransformationalMethod`. | Specs, CAD, theorem scripts, IaC SCRs. |
| **Run‑Time** | *Tᴿ* | Interval(s) during which the holon **executes its own `OperationalMethod`s** and is assumed structurally stable (self‑maintenance allowed). | Telemetry, transaction logs, field data, physical wear. |

**Temporal invariants**

```text
Tᴰ ∩ Tᴿ = ∅                     (never overlap)
Tᴰ ∪ Tᴿ = worldline(holon)      (cover full existence)
version(n+1) created only in Tᴰₙ (monotonic lineage)
````

#### Open‑Ended Evolution Principle

A holon may repeat the cycle *ad infinitum*:

```
(H₀ in Tᴿ₀) → observe → Δspec in Tᴰ₁ → build → H₁ in Tᴿ₁ → …
```

*Observation itself is a transformation*:
An **External Transformer** (`U.System` playing `transformerRole ⊑ TransformerRole`)
executes a **measurement method** whose *output* is an epistemic holon
containing observations.  Thus the traditional “External Observer Pattern” collapses into
the universal external Transformer pattern.

### Archetypal Grounding

| Phase                 | Pump‑v2 (`U.System`)                                                                         | Proof‑v2 (`U.Episteme`)                                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Design‑Time**       | 3‑D CAD + G‑code; stress‑sim config.                                                         | Lean/Coq script of theorem; dependency graph.                                           |
| **Run‑Time**          | Pump circulates coolant under `OperatePump` method.                                          | Theorem cited & reused; runtime is “being relied on”.                                   |
| **Run → Design loop** | Sensor data shows cavitation; anomaly report produced by monitoring server (`transformerRole`). | New experiment contradicts corollary; lab apparatus + scientists act as `transformerRole`. |
| **Design → Run loop** | Engineers author Pump‑v3 spec, printer (`TransformerRole`) fabricates it.                    | Community revises proof, proof‑assistant (`TransformerRole`) verifies Proof‑v3.         |

*(Diagrammatic lineage table omitted for brevity but included in annex.)*

### Conformance Checklist  

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| **CC‑A.4.1** | Every `U.Holon` **MUST** be tagged with its current temporal scope (*Tᴰ* or *Tᴿ*). | Eliminates blueprint/reality ambiguity. |
| **CC‑A.4.2** | A transition from *Tᴰ* → *Tᴿ* **SHALL** be modeled as `executes(Transformer, U.TransformationalMethod)`. | Guarantees physical grounding of instantiation. |
| **CC‑A.4.3** | A transition from *Tᴿ* → *Tᴰ* **SHALL** be modeled as `executes(transformerRole, U.TransformationalMethod)` producing an observational `U.Episteme`. | Ensures observation is treated as transformation. |
| **CC‑A.4.4** | `Tᴰ ∩ Tᴿ = ∅` and the concatenated intervals **MUST** equal the holon’s worldline. | Guards against illicit overlap. |
| **CC‑A.4.5** | Each new design version **MUST** reference (`refinesVersion`) exactly one predecessor or declare `firstVersion = true`. | Enforces monotonic lineage for auditability. |

---

### Consequences  

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|--------------------------|
| **Audit‑Ready engineering workflow** – Every state and change is explicitly typed, timed, and causally linked to a physical system/Tramsformer. | Additional metadata tagging; mitigated by templates in Authoring Guide (E 8). |
| **Unified View of Build & Measure** – Observation, test, simulation, maintenance, and fabrication all share one mechanism. | Requires modelers to think in terms of Transformers even for “passive” sensing; mitigated by role libraries (`transformerRole`, `CalibratorRole`, etc.). |
| **Foundation for Learning Loops** – Enables higher patterns (e.g., B 4 Canonical Evolution Loop, D 3 Trust Calculus) to reason over evidence accrual and version fitness, including self-modification. | None significant—temporal scoping is already needed for safety‑critical provenance. |

---

### Rationale (extended)  

1. **Why separate scopes?**  
   Real‑world artefacts SCR the *as‑intended* versus *as‑is* gap.
   By formalising that gap, FPF prevents silent assumption of perfect
   fidelity and allows quantified error (`U.Error`) to drive evolution.

2. **Why treat observation as transformation?**  
   Physics tells us measurement changes state (energy, information, even
   quantum collapse).  Making the observer just another `Transformer`
   means: no special metaphysics, full energy/provenance accounting,
   seamless tie‑in with Constructor Theory (see A 3 Rationale §2).

3. **Why insist on open‑endedness?**  
   *Perfect* finality is unattainable outside mathematics mandates that holons must be *improvable* in principle; this pattern
   encodes that mandate structurally: version n+1 is always possible.

4. **Why no overlap (*Tᴰ* ∩ *Tᴿ*)?**  
   The instant a holon is mutable (design) it ceases to be the “same”
   operational asset relied upon for guarantees.  Overlap would break
   trust calculations and violate A.7 Strict Distinction.

This pattern therefore realises three core principles in concert:

* **Temporal Duality** – explicit tagging of states.  
* **Open‑Ended Evolution** – guaranteed pathway for refinement.  
* **Ontological Parsimony** – one mechanism (Transformer) for all
  state changes, avoiding specialised “observer” or “installer” types.

> *“Blueprints dream; instances speak.  
> Evolution is the conversation between them.”*

## A.5 Open‑Ended Kernel & Architheory Layering \[A] 

### Context

FPF’s ambition is to act as an *“operating system for thought.”*
That ambition can only be realised if the framework:

* **(i)** remains *stable* and *self‑consistent* over multi‑decade timespans;
* **(ii)** *invites*, rather than resists, the continual influx of new disciplinary knowledge; and
* **(iii)** allows multiple, even competing, explanatory lenses to coexist without forcing a “winner‑takes‑all” unification.

Historically, grand “total” ontologies—Aristotle’s *Categories*, Carnap’s *Logical Construction of the World*, Bunge’s *TOE*—failed precisely because each tried to embed every domain’s primitives directly into a single monolith.  Once the monolith cracked under domain pressure, the whole edifice became unmaintainable.

### Problem

If FPF were to let **domain‑specific primitives creep into its Kernel**, two pathologies would follow:

| Pathology               | Manifestation                                                                                                                  | Breach of Constitution                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kernel Bloat**        | Every new field (e.g. synthetic biology) adds bespoke `U.Type`s → Core size explodes, review surface becomes unscalable.       | Violates **C‑5 Ontological Parsimony**; erodes **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance**. |
| **Conceptual Gridlock** | Conflicting axioms (deterministic thermodynamics vs. indeterministic econ‑metrics) must fight for space in the same namespace. | Breaks **C‑3 Cross‑Scale Consistency**; triggers chronic DRR deadlock.     |

A *minimal, extensible* design is therefore mandatory.

### Forces

| Force                            | Tension                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Stability vs. Evolvability**   | Immutable core needed for trust ↔ constant domain innovation needed for relevance.                                       |
| **Universality vs. Specificity** | Single kernel language ↔ rich idioms for fields as diverse as robotics, jurisprudence, metabolomics.                     |
| **Parsimony vs. Coverage**       | Few primitives keep reasoning elegant ↔ framework must still model energy budgets, epistemic uncertainty, agentic goals. |

### Solution 

FPF adopts a **micro‑kernel hour‑glass** architecture consisting of a *strictly minimal* core plus an **infinite flat namespace of plug‑ins** called *architheories*. (The formal plug‑in contract is defined in **A.6 Architheory Signature & Realisation**.)

**1 The Open‑Ended Kernel**
The Kernel’s *normative* content is frozen to three buckets only:

* **Foundational Ontology:** `Entity`, `Holon`, `Boundary`, `Role`, `design‑/run‑time`, etc. (A‑cluster, Part A).
* **Universal Reasoning Patterns:** Γ‑aggregation, MHT, Trust calculus, Canonical evolution loop, etc. (B‑cluster, Part B).
* **Ecosystem Contracts:** Guard‑Rails (E‑cluster) and the Architheory Signature schema (A.6).

Everything else—physics, logic operators beyond minimal MODAL, resource semantics, agent decision calculus—is *expelled* to architheories.

**2 Architheory Layering**

+To manage this extensibility without creating chaos, FPF classifies all architheories into three mutually exclusive classes, each with a distinct role. This classification governs what an architheory is allowed to do.

| Class | Mnemonic | Conceptual Mandate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Calculus** | **CAL** - *The Builder* | Introduces a new composite holon type and **exactly one** aggregation operator `Γ_*` that *constructs* such holons from parts. |
| **Logic** | **LOG** - *The Reasoner* | Adds rules of inference or proof patterns *about* existing holons. **It cannot create new composite holons** and thus exports no `Γ_*` operator. |
| **Characterization**| **CHR** - *The Observer* | Attaches metrics or descriptive properties to existing holons. **It neither constructs nor infers new holons** and exports no `Γ_*` operator. |

Each architheory (CAL / LOG / CHR):

* **extends** the Kernel by *importing* its primitives and *exporting* new, *typed* vocabularies;
* remains **self‑contained**—it must **not mutate** Kernel axioms (CC‑A.6.x);
* is versioned, compared, and substituted entirely via its *Signature* (public contract) while permitting multiple *Realizations* (private axiom-sets).

Architheories therefore form the **“fat top & bottom”** of the hour‑glass:

```

*Wide variety of concrete instances* → **narrow, stable Kernel neck** → *wide variety of analysis & tooling*.

### Rationale

*Micro‑kernels* succeeded in operating‑system research because they separated **immutable primitives** (threads, IPC) from **replaceable servers** (file‑systems, network stacks).
FPF adopts the same strategy:

* **Immutable primitives** → the Part A Kernel (holons, roles, transformer quartet, temporal scopes, constitutional C‑rules).
* **Replaceable servers** → architheories in Part C (each with its own calculus, logic, characterisation kit).

This delivers on **P‑4 (Open‑Ended Kernel)**, **P‑5 (Plugin Layering)** and keeps the framework aligned with modern proof‑assistant ecosystems (Lean’s *mathlib* vs. core).

The “hour‑glass” brings two further advantages:

1. **Pluralism with auditability** – rival CALs can coexist; the Kernel’s Trust pipeline (B.3) quantifies their evidence base.
2. **Future‑proofing** – if a genuinely new substrate (e.g., quantum knowledge objects) emerges, it plugs in at the bottom layer without touching Part A.

---

### Relations

* **Instantiates:** P‑4, P‑5, and relies on Guard‑Rails E.5 (especially Unidirectional Dependency).
* **Provides contract for:** every entry in **Part C**; style enforced via **Architheory Signature & Realization (A .6)**.
* **Feeds:** Trans‑disciplinary reasoning operators in **Part B** – Γ, MHT, Trust, Evolution Loop all treat each CAL uniformly through the Kernel neck.

> *“A stable neck sustains an ever‑growing hour‑glass.”*

### A.6 — Architheory Signature & Realization  \[A]

**Context**

FPF’s architecture is built on a modular ecosystem of **architheories** (CAL/LOG/CHR) that extend a minimal kernel (Pattern A.5). For this ecosystem to function coherently, without descending into a "big ball of mud," each architheory must expose a stable, predictable, and machine-readable public contract. This contract, or **Signature**, allows other architheories to depend on its capabilities without needing to know anything about its internal logic or implementation, which is called its **Realization**.

**Problem**

If the line between an architheory's public contract and its private implementation is blurred, the entire FPF ecosystem becomes brittle and unscalable. Three critical failure modes emerge:

1.  **Tight-Coupling Cascade:** Any change to an architheory's internal axioms or logic immediately risks breaking every other architheory that depends on it, leading to cascading failures and development gridlock.
2.  **Loss of Polymorphism:** It becomes impossible for alternative implementations of the same concept (e.g., a classical vs. an intuitionistic logic) to coexist, as each would expose its unique internal structure, forcing a "winner-takes-all" scenario.
3.  **Opaque Composition:** Without a formal, declarative contract, it is impossible to automatically verify if a set of architheories is compatible. Teams are forced into manual, error-prone integration checks, and the promise of a predictable, composable "operating system for thought" is broken.

**Forces**

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stability vs. Freedom** | Public contracts must remain stable for long-term compatibility, while the internal logic of an architheory must be free to evolve and improve. |
| **Universality vs. Specificity**| The contract mechanism must be uniform for all architheories, yet each calculus, logic, or characterization exports a unique set of concepts and guarantees. |
| **Clarity vs. Boilerplate** | The contract must be simple and clear enough for a human to read and understand, yet formal enough for a machine to parse and verify. |
| **Implicit vs. Explicit Guarantees**| How do we move from an informal dependency ("this architheory runs after that one") to an explicit, verifiable contract of preconditions and postconditions? |

**Solution**

FPF mandates a strict architectural separation between an architheory's public **Signature** and its private **Realization**. The Signature is the timeless, formal contract, while the Realization is the concrete, mutable implementation.

**1. The `U.ArchitheorySignature` — The Public, Declarative Contract**

A Signature is a **normative, machine-readable declaration** of *what* an architheory promises to the FPF ecosystem. It is purely declarative and contains no implementation logic. To make this contract explicit and verifiable, every Signature **SHALL** be structured around a four-part **Signature Block**:

| Item | Purpose | Manager's View: What It Means |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Imports** | A list of the `U.Types` and relations that **MUST** already be present for this architheory to function. | "Here are the ingredients and tools this architheory needs to do its job." |
| **Derivations** | A list of the new `U.Types`, relations, or constraints that this architheory **produces** if its rules are successfully applied. | "Here is the new knowledge or capability this architheory adds to the model." |
| **Invariants** | A set of mathematical or logical statements that this architheory **guarantees** will be true for its outputs. | "Here are the promises this architheory makes. You can rely on these guarantees." |
| **BelongsToAssurance** | A tag specifying which **Assurance Subtype** (Typing, Verification, or Validation) the architheory primarily supports. | "This architheory helps with ensuring correct naming (Typing), logical soundness (Verification), or real-world correctness (Validation)." |

This Signature Block transforms the concept of an interface from a vague notion into a concrete, auditable artifact.

**2. The `U.ArchitheoryRealization` — The Private, Opaque Implementation**

A Realization is the **private, internal body of logic** that fulfills the promises made in a Signature. It contains the concrete axioms, definitions, algorithms, and proof scripts.

*   **Opacity:** The internal details of a Realization are **opaque** to all other architheories. They can only interact with it through the formal `provides` and `invariants` declared in its public Signature.
*   **Polymorphism:** A single Signature **MAY** be fulfilled by multiple, competing Realizations. This is the key to FPF's flexibility. For example, a `Logic-CAL` Signature could be implemented by both a classical logic Realization and an intuitionistic one. A user or a higher-level architheory can then choose which Realization to use without changing any code that depends only on the Signature.

```
Signature (e.g., Logic-CAL)
  ├─ Realization α (Classical Axioms)
  └─ Realization β (Intuitionistic Axioms)
```

**3. The Γ-Export Policy and Layering**

To maintain a clear separation of concerns between constructing, reasoning, and describing, FPF enforces a strict policy on which architheory classes can export an aggregation operator (`Γ`).

*   A **CAL** (Calculus) architheory **SHALL** export **exactly one** aggregation operator `Γ_*` in its Signature's `Derivations`. This operator is its primary "builder" function.
*   **LOG** (Logic) and **CHR** (Characterization) architheories **SHALL NOT** export any `Γ_*` operator. They can reason about or describe artifacts created by a Calculus, but they cannot create new composite holons themselves.
*   The import graph **SHALL** be acyclic, with dependencies generally pointing "down" towards the foundational Calculi. A LOG or CHR may import from a CAL, but a CAL should not depend on a LOG or CHR for its core constructive logic.

**4. Signature Header and Metadata**

For governance and automated processing, each architheory **SHALL** provide a **Signature header** in its manifestation, containing:

*   `id`: The canonical, PascalCase identifier (e.g., `Sys-CAL`).
*   `version`: The semantic version of the architheory.
*   `status`: The lifecycle state (`draft`, `review`, `stable`, `deprecated`).
*   `classification`: The architheory class (`CAL`, `LOG`, `CHR`).

**Archetypal Grounding**

Let's illustrate the Signature/Realization split with two examples.

| Aspect | `U.System` Example – Robotic Arm | `U.Episteme` Example – Parsing Grammar |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Signature** | **`RobArm-CAL` Signature Block:** <br> • **Imports:** `Sys-CAL` (`U.System`). <br> • **Derivations:** `U.System:RobotArm`, `Γ_pickPlace` operator. <br> • **Invariants:** `endEffectorPosition` is always within `workspaceBoundary`. <br> • **BelongsToAssurance:** Verification. | **`Grammar-CAL` Signature Block:** <br> • **Imports:** `KD-CAL` (`U.Episteme`). <br> • **Derivations:** `U.Episteme:Grammar`, `parse` operator. <br> • **Invariants:** `parse(input)` is deterministic. <br> • **BelongsToAssurance:** Verification. |
| **Realization A** | A six-axis articulated arm model with detailed kinematic equations and servo motor torque limits. | A context-free grammar (CFG) implementation in Backus-Naur Form (BNF) for parsing JSON. |
| **Realization B** | A SCARA arm model with different kinematics (fewer degrees of freedom, faster for planar tasks). | A Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) implementation, which is also capable of parsing JSON but uses a different, non-backtracking algorithm. |
| **Benefit of the Split** | A factory automation architheory that imports `RobArm-CAL` can choose the six-axis arm for complex assembly or the SCARA arm for simple pick-and-place tasks. The choice is made by selecting a *Realization*, but the rest of the factory model, which depends only on the `RobArm-CAL` *Signature* (e.g., the `Γ_pickPlace` operator), remains unchanged. | A data validation architheory that imports `Grammar-CAL` can use either the BNF or PEG Realization to parse input. The choice might depend on performance needs or error handling preferences, but the higher-level logic that calls the `parse` operator does not need to be modified. |

This **Signature-only dependency** is the architectural guarantee that enables this powerful "plug-and-play" capability, allowing the FPF ecosystem to be both stable and highly adaptable.

**Conformance Checklist**

*   **CC-A6.1 (Signature Mandate):** Every architheory **MUST** declare exactly one `Signature`, and this Signature **MUST** contain a complete four-part **Signature Block** (`Imports`, `Derivations`, `Invariants`, `BelongsToAssurance`).
*   **CC-A6.2 (Realization Mandate):** Every architheory **MUST** provide at least one `Realization` that is demonstrably consistent with the promises made in its Signature.
*   **CC-A6.3 (Acyclic Dependency):** The global graph of `imports` between architheory Signatures **MUST** be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
*   **CC-A6.4 (Opaque Realization):** An axiom or rule within a Realization **SHALL NOT** reference the internal details of another architheory's Realization; it can only depend on its public Signature.
*   **CC-A6.5 (Γ-Export Rule):** Only architheories with `classification: CAL` **MAY** export a `Γ_*` operator, and they **SHALL** export exactly one. `LOG` and `CHR` architheories **SHALL NOT** export a `Γ_*` operator.
*   **CC-A6.6 (Liskov Substitutability):** A Realization **MAY** tighten the constraints or invariants promised by its Signature (e.g., offer stronger guarantees), but it **SHALL NOT** relax or contradict them. This ensures any Realization can be safely substituted for another under the same Signature.

**Consequences**

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hard Decoupling & Stability:** The FPF kernel and core architheories remain stable, as swapping a Realization never breaks dependent architheories. This dramatically reduces integration risk and maintenance costs. | **Authoring Discipline:** Architheory authors must invest upfront effort in designing a clean, stable Signature and explicitly documenting the Signature Block. *Mitigation:* FPF provides templates and checklists to streamline this process. |
| **Enables Polymorphism and Competition:** The pattern allows alternative logics, physics models, or algorithms to coexist and compete under the same standard interface, fostering innovation. | **Potential for Over-abstraction:** A poorly designed Signature might be too abstract to be useful or too specific to allow for meaningful alternative Realizations. *Mitigation:* The FPF governance process (DRRs) includes a review of proposed Signatures for clarity and utility. |
| **Machine-Checkable Composition:** Because `imports`, `derivations`, and `invariants` are declared formally, automated tools can verify the compatibility of a set of architheories before any reasoning begins, catching integration errors early. | - |
| **Clear Pass Interface:** The Signature Block provides a clear, predictable "pass interface" for the Unification Routes. A modeller or tool knows exactly what state to expect after a given architheory has been applied. | - |

**Rationale**

This pattern elevates the classic "interface vs. implementation" separation from software engineering to the level of entire bodies of knowledge. The term **Signature** is chosen deliberately for its resonance in both computer science (a function's signature defines its contract) and mathematics (a theory's signature enumerates its symbols). This dual meaning serves **Cognitive Elegance (P-1)** and **Didactic Primacy (P-2)**.

By formalizing the Signature with the four-part **Signature Block**, this pattern moves beyond a simple `provides` list to a rich, verifiable contract. The `Imports` and `Invariants` fields establish explicit pre- and post-conditions for each architheory's application. This operationalizes **Cross-Scale Consistency (P-8)** by ensuring that as a model is refined by a sequence of architheories, the guarantees accumulate in a predictable, auditable chain.

Ultimately, the Signature/Realization split is the core mechanism that allows FPF to be both **stable and endlessly extensible**, fulfilling the promise of the **Open-Ended Kernel (P-4)** and **Plug-in Layering (P-5)** principles. It provides the architectural foundation for a modular, governable, and trustworthy ecosystem of thought.

**Relations**

*   **Implements & constrains:** `A.5 Open-Ended Kernel & Architheory Layering`.
*   **Is instantiated by:** Every architheory in **Part C**.
*   **Enables:** The concept of **Unification Routes**, where architheories are applied in a predictable sequence.
*   **Provides the formal structure for:** The `manifest.yaml` file of every architheory.

## A.6 Architheory Signature & Realization  \[A] 

### Context

FPF depends on a growing library of **architheories** (CAL / LOG / CHR) that extend the minimal kernel with domain‑specific concepts. Without a **stable public contract** for each architheory, the ecosystem would suffer tight‑coupling, version pinning, and un‑auditable conceptual drift.

### Problem

If an architheory’s *internal* definitions are exposed as its *external* contract, three systemic failures arise:

1. **Tight‑Coupling Cascade** – any local change in a module’s internal axioms propagates unpredictably through every module that re‑uses those axioms.
2. **Loss of Polymorphism** – two alternative treatments of the same domain (e.g., classical vs. constructive logic) cannot co‑exist, because each forces its private axioms onto dependants.
3. **Opaque Compatibility** – without a machine‑checkable declaration of imports/exports, nobody can guarantee whether a given set of architheories is semantically consistent.
4. **Hidden dependency cycles** – because imports would be implicit, acyclic composition could not be guaranteed.

### Forces

| Force                            | Tension                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Stability vs. Freedom**        | Keep public contracts frozen ↔ allow internal axioms to evolve.                                                          |
| **Universality vs. Specificity** | One uniform pattern for all architheories ↔ each calculus exports very different constructs.                             |
| **Cognitive Elegance**           | Use a term that engineers and logicians instantly recognise ↔ avoid vocabulary that carries tool or process connotation. |

### Solution

FPF introduces a **strict interface pattern**:

#### 1. `U.ArchitheorySignature` — *the public contract*
A Signature is **timeless**. It declares only **what** an architheory contributes, never **how**.

| Field      | Purpose                                           | Examples                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `id`       | Canonical name, globally unique.                  | `Sys‑CAL`  ·  `Logic‑CAL`                |
| `imports`  | Set of **other Signatures** required.             | `[Kernel, Kind-CAL]`                     |
| `provides` | Set of new `U.Type`s **and** universal operators. | `U.Port`, `Γ\_sys`, `implies`, `entails` |

*Invariant:* the **import graph must be acyclic** (no hidden recursion).

#### 2. `U.ArchitheoryRealization` — *the private implementation*
A Realization binds a Signature to a concrete body of **axioms, definitions, proofs**.
Multiple Realizations MAY exist for the same Signature and MAY coexist in the same model so long as they **do not contradict** each other’s exports.

```
Signature  ──╼  Realization α   (classical logic axioms)
           └─╼  Realization β   (intuitionistic axioms)
```

#### 2.1 · Normative Signature Block (Imports–Derivations–Invariants–Assurance)

Every Architheory **SHALL** publish a compact **Signature Block** with four items:

| Item | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Imports** | The `U.Types` / relations that **MUST** already be present or are produced by earlier passes. |
| **Derivations** | New relations/constraints the architheory **produces** when its rules succeed. |
| **Invariants** | Mathematical statements the architheory **proves** (or marks `todo` with justification). |
| **BelongsToAssurance** | One of **Typing / Verification / Validation** identifying the assurance sub‑layer. |

*Intent:* to make pass interfaces explicit so downstream architheories can rely on declared guarantees.

#### 2.2 · Γ‑export policy and layering

* A **CAL** architheory **SHALL** export **exactly one** aggregation operator `Γ` (its builder).
* **LOG** and **CHR** architheories **SHALL NOT** export `Γ`.
* Import layering **SHALL** respect the holonic stack: LOG/CHR **may** import CAL; CAL **may** import CAL; import graphs are **acyclic**.

This reflects the Part C catalogue where, e.g., LOG‑CAL may import Kind-CAL, while builders remain confined to the calculus layer.

#### 2.3 · Signature header (metadata)

Each Architheory **SHALL** begin with a **Signature header** capturing:
`id` (PascalCase), `version` (semver), `status` (draft/review/stable/deprecated),
`classification` (CAL/LOG/CHR), `imports` (list), `provides` (list, including Γ if CAL).
Anchors for any quoted artefacts **SHALL** be provided via **SCR/RSCR** (A.10). 

#### 2.4 · Conformance checklist (author‑facing)
* [ ] Section provides the four‑row Signature Block.
* [ ] If `classification = CAL`, exactly one Γ is named.
* [ ] Imports point **down** the layering and remain acyclic.
* [ ] Any referenced artefacts are anchored by SCR/RSCR identifiers.

#### 3. Normative Relations

* `implements(Realization, Signature)` — mandatory and one‑way.
* `imports(Signatureᵢ, Signatureⱼ)` — edges of the dependency DAG.
* `provides(Signature, U.Type ∪ Operator)` — defines the public namespace.

These three relations are **purely conceptual**; they do **not** prescribe files, folders, CI jobs, or version tags.

#### Archetypal Grounding

| quartet Element     | `U.System` Example – Robotic Arm                                                                  | `U.Episteme` Example – Parsing Grammar                                                                |

| **Signature**     | `RobArm-CAL`: imports `Sys-CAL`; provides `U.System:RobotArm`, `Γ_pickPlace`.                     | `Grammar-CAL`: imports `KD-CAL`; provides `U.Episteme:Grammar`, `parse`.                              |
| **Realization A** | Six‑axis arm with servo motors, kinematic limits, torque model.                                   | Context‑free BNF grammar for JSON.                                                                    |
| **Realization B** | SCARA arm with step‑per‑second constraints, pneumatic gripper model.                              | Parsing‐expression grammar (PEG) for JSON.                                                            |
| **Swap Effect**   | Vehicle‑assembly CAL that *imports* `RobArm‑CAL` can transparently choose either arm Realization. | Data‑validation CAL that *imports* `Grammar‑CAL` can transparently choose either grammar Realization. |

The **Signature‑only dependency** guarantees the swap is safe and localised—no ripple across the rest of the specification.

The *Vehicle‑CAL* architheory can depend on `Engine‑CAL` **without knowing** which Realization (V8 or Electric) is loaded; likewise *Arg‑LOG* can build arguments on `Logic‑CAL` independently of whether proofs are classical or constructive.

| **CC‑A.6.5** | A Signature’s `provides` list **MUST NOT** redeclare any `U.Type` already exported by its transitive `imports`.                                                   | Prevents accidental shadowing.                          |

| **CC‑A.6.7** | If multiple Realizations are shipped for one Signature, authors **SHOULD** supply a short `Rationale` comparing trade‑offs (performance, constructiveness, etc.). | Satisfies **Didactic Primacy** without leaking tooling. |

#### Consequences

* **Hard decoupling** – kernel stability preserved; swapping a Realization never breaks dependents.
* **In‑framework competition** – alternative logics, physics, economic models can live side‑by‑side under the same interface.
* **Machine‑checkable composition** – because imports form a DAG and “provides” names are explicit, automated loaders can detect conflicts before reasoning begins.

#### Rationale

 Why the word **“Signature”**?

* **Software analogy** – a *function signature* tells programmers the inputs/outputs without revealing source code. By analogy, an *architheory signature* tells other thinkers exactly **which concepts** and **operators** are on offer.
* **Mathematical analogy** – in model theory the **signature of a theory** enumerates its symbols; multiple *models* (our *Realizations*) can satisfy the same signature.
* **Didactic power** – unlike “SCR” (politically loaded) or “interface contract” (tooling flavour), “Signature” is compact, neutral, and familiar to both engineers and mathematicians.

This naming choice directly serves **P‑1 (Cognitive Elegance)** and **P‑2 (Didactic Primacy)**, while the whole pattern operationalises **P‑4 (Open‑Ended Kernel)** and **P‑5 (Plugin Layering)**.

Because every plug‑in architheory surfaces only its Signature, the Kernel language stays permanently slim—even if hundreds of CAL/LOG/CHR modules accumulate above it.  That is how FPF simultaneously honours **Ontological Parsimony (C‑5)** and **Cross‑Scale Consistency (C‑3)**: new concepts appear only as *exports* of a Signature, never as ad‑hoc patches to the Kernel.

The Signature/Realization split is also the key that lets FPF host genuinely **competing** world‑views.  A `Logic‑CAL` user can switch from a classical to an intuitionistic Realization without touching anything that merely *imports* `Logic‑CAL`.  In practice this enables:

| Domain question                                | Signature stays …                                 | Realization can vary …                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| “What proofs are acceptable?”                  | `Logic-CAL` ≡ `{U.Proposition, implies, entails}` | Classical / Intuitionistic / Sub‑structural |
| “What engines drive this vehicle architheory?” | `Engine-CAL`                                      | Internal‑combustion / Electric / Fuel‑cell  |

Exactly the same pattern later supports future CALs for economics, biology, or jurisprudence—avoiding the “one size fits none” trap.

#### Relations

* **Implements & constrains:** `pat:kernel/open-ended-kernel` (A.5).
* **Depends on:** foundational ontology (`Holon`, `Role`, etc.) from A.1–A.2.
* **Instantiated by:** every CAL / LOG / CHR in **Part C**.

> *“A Signature is the promise; a Realization is but one way of keeping it.”*



## **Cluster A.V · Constitutional Principles of the Kernel**

### A.7 — Strict Distinction (Clarity Lattice)  \[A]

#### 1 · Intent

Provide a **single, didactically clear lattice of distinctions** that keeps models free from category errors. This pattern is the guard‑rail that prevents four recurrent confusions:

1. **Role vs Function** (mask vs behaviour),
2. **MethodDescription vs Method vs Work** (description vs capability vs occurrence),
3. **Holon vs System vs Episteme** (what can act and what cannot),
4. **Episteme vs Carrier** (knowledge vs its material signs).

It harmonizes A.12 (External Transformer), A.13 (Agential Role & Agency Spectrum), A.14 (Advanced Mereology), and A.15 (Role–Method–Work Alignment).

#### 2 · Context

* **Holons (A.1) and systems.** All holons are part/whole units; **only systems** can enact behaviour.
* **Externalization (A.12).** Every change is performed by a **system bearing TransformerRole** across a boundary; there is no “self‑magic”.
* **Quartet backbone (A.3, A.15).** We separate **MethodDescription** (description), **Method** (design‑time capability), and **Work** (run‑time occurrence), with the **system bearing TransformerRole** as the acting side.
* **Evidence (A.10).** Knowledge claims are anchored via **Symbol‑Carrier Register (SCR)**; epistemes never “act”, they are **used** by systems that act on their **carriers**.

Manager’s reading: if a sentence could be read as “the document decided” or “the process executed itself”, it violates A.7.

---

#### 3 · Problem

When documents blur the above lines, three classes of defects appear:

1. **Category collapse.** People write “function/role/process” interchangeably; teams then disagree whether they are changing a plan, a capability, or reporting an actual occurrence.
2. **Agency misplacement.** Epistemes (documents, models) are treated as doers; collectives as raw sets; or a “holon” is used where **only a system** makes sense.
3. **Audit failures.** A MethodDescription is cited as if it were evidence; or Work has no anchors (no carriers, no time span), making trust impossible (B.3).

---

#### 4 · Forces

| Force                                        | Tension                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Didactic brevity vs conceptual precision** | Teams want short words (“process”, “function”) ↔ the framework must keep five distinct layers apart.                                |
| **Universality vs domain idioms**            | We support engineering idioms (procedure, SOP, algorithm, workflow) ↔ internally we must map them unambiguously.                    |
| **Parsimony vs completeness**                | Minimal concept set ↔ enough distinctions to avoid the classic traps (role/function; plan/capability/occurrence; episteme/carrier). |

**Terminology (normative): Four orthogonal characteristics**
• **senseFamily** — the categorical characteristic, used by F.7/F.8/F.9: {Role | Status | Measurement | Type‑structure | Method | Execution}. Rows must be **sense‑uniform**. 
• **ReferencePlane** — the referent mode per CHR: {world/external | conceptual | epistemic}. 
• **I/D/S layer** — the Intension/Description/Specification layer (E.10.D2). Not a I/D/S “plane” or "stance", and not a bare "layer".
• **design/run Stance** — the design vs run temporal stance. Not a temporal “plane” or "layer", and not a bare "stance".

#### 5 · Solution — The **Clarity Lattice** (normative distinctions & safe vocabulary)

A.7 establishes the following **pairs and triplets**. Use their **names** and **scope** exactly as below.

##### 5.1 Role vs Function (behaviour)

* **Role (role‑object, mask).** A contextual **position** a holon can bear (A.2, A.15). A role is **not behaviour**; it is the **mask** under which behaviour may be enacted.

  * Example: **Cooling‑CirculatorRole** in a thermal loop.
* **Function = behaviour = Method under a role.** What a **system** actually does **when bearing a role**. In Transformer context, this behaviour is the **Method** (design‑time capability) that can be executed as **Work** (run‑time).

  * Safe rewrite for earlier “Holonic Duality (Substance ⧧ Function)”:
    **Holonic Duality (Substance ⧧ Role).** A `U.System` keeps its identity (substance) while **switching roles**; each role may entail a **Method** (behaviour) and its possible **Work** (occurrence).

**Normative guard:** Use “**Role**” for the mask; use “**Method/Work**” for behaviour/occurrence. Do **not** call the role itself a function.

##### 5.2 MethodDescription vs Method vs Work (design vs capability vs occurrence)

* **MethodDescription** — the **description** (algorithm / SOP / recipe / script) at design‑time. Anchored via **SCR** (A.10).
* **Method** — the **order‑sensitive capability** the **system bearing TransformerRole** can enact, composed with **Γ\_method** (B.1.5). A Method **exists only while** related **Work** is underway; outside executions refer to it **via MethodDescription** (see A.15 §2.2, §4.1).
* **Work** — the **dated run‑time occurrence** (what actually happened), with resource spend (Γ\_work) and temporal coverage (Γ\_time).

**Normative guard:** Never use MethodDescription as evidence of Work; never present Method as if it had happened.

##### 5.3 Holon vs System vs Episteme (who can act)

* **System** — the only holon kind that can **bear behavioural roles** and enact **Method/Work**.
* **Episteme** — **cannot act**; it is **changed via its carriers** by a system. Epistemes **may bear non‑behavioural roles** (e.g., **ReferenceRole**, **ConstraintSourceRole**).
* **Holon** — umbrella term; **do not** use it where only **system** is meaningful (e.g., “holon bearing TransformerRole” is **invalid**; write “**system bearing TransformerRole**”).

**Normative guard:** Behavioural roles (including TransformerRole) have **domain = system**. Epistemes may bear purely **classificatory** roles only.

##### 5.4 Episteme vs Symbol Carrier (SCR/RSCR)

* **Episteme** — the knowledge content (claim, model, requirement set).
* **Symbol Carrier** — the physical/digital sign that carries the episteme (file, volume, dataset item), tracked in **SCR**; remote sets in **RSCR**.
* **Use:** Evidence, provenance, and reproducibility address **carriers**; arguments and validity address **epistemes**.

**Normative guard:** When you say “we updated the spec”, detail **which carriers** changed (A.10).

##### 5.5 Collective vs Set, and MemberOf vs Component/Constituent/Portion/Phase (A.14)

* **Set / Collection (MemberOf)** — **mathematical or catalog** grouping; **no joint behaviour** implied.
* **Collective System** — a **system** with boundary and coordination Method (e.g., a team).
* **Use relations correctly:**

  * **ComponentOf** — mechanical/structural part in systems.
  * **ConstituentOf** — logical/content part in epistemes.
  * **PortionOf** — quantitative portion with conserved extensives.
  * **PhaseOf** — temporal part/state across a continuous identity.
  * **RoleBearerOf** — a **system** is the **bearer** of a **Role**.

**Normative guard:** If the grouping is expected to **act**, model a **collective system** (not a set) and provide its role and Method/Work.

##### 5.6 Operator alignment (names you MUST use)

* **Γ\_sys** — composition of **system** properties (physical/systemic).
* **Γ\_method** — composition of **Method** (order, branching).
* **Γ\_time** — composition of **Work** histories and temporal parts.
* **Γ\_work** — composition of **resource spend** and yields tied to Work. Do not track costs with Γ\_method; costs (resources/yield) belong to Γ\_work.

**Normative guard:** Avoid generic “process” for these operators. Reserve “process” for domain idioms; map internally to **Method** (design) and **Work** (run).

---

#### 6 · Grounding & didactic examples

**Example 1 — Pump in a cooling loop**

* **Substance (system):** Centrifugal pump P‑12.
* **Role:** **Cooling‑CirculatorRole**.
* **MethodDescription:** “Loop Circulation v3” (anchored in SCR).
* **Method:** ordered capability: start → ramp → hold → stop (Γ\_method).
* **Work:** run on 2025‑08‑09 10:00–10:45; energy ledger via Γ\_work; log via Γ\_time.
* **Safe phrasing:** *“The **system bearing TransformerRole** (P‑12 control unit) executed the **Method** described by **MethodDescription**, producing **Work** …”*
* **What not to write:** “The pump’s function is the role” (role ≠ behaviour).

**Example 2 — Standard document cited in a design**

* **Episteme:** “Safety Standard S‑174”.
* **Carriers:** PDF (SCR id: scr://std/S‑174/2025‑07), printed volume (scr://print/S‑174/2e).
* **Role:** **ReferenceRole** in the valve selection activity.
* **System bearing TransformerRole:** design team’s selection service.
* **MethodDescription:** “Valve Selection SOP v5”.
* **Method/Work:** capability and dated selection session that **used** the standard; the episteme did **not** act.

**Example 3 — Set vs team**

* **Set (MemberOf):** {Alice, Bob, 3.14} — a collection; **no behaviour** implied.
* **Collective system (team):** boundary, coordination **Method**, supervision **Work**; can bear **AgentialRole** (A.13).
* **Safe phrasing:** *“Team T plays **Cooling‑MaintenanceRole** and executed Work W…”*

| **CC‑A7.7 (Collective vs set)**          | If a grouping is expected to **act**, it **MUST** be modelled as a **collective system** (boundary + coordination Method + Work), not as a **MemberOf** set.                                                                                                                                   | Presence of boundary, Method, Work for the group.                                                                                         |

#### 9 · Anti‑patterns (with fixes)

1. **Role‑as‑behaviour** — calling the **role** “the function”.
   **Fix:** Name the **role** + **Method/Work** pair explicitly.

2. **Episteme‑as‑system** — “the model routed traffic”.
   **Fix:** Name the **system** (or Transformer as a system bearing AgentialRole) that used the model; list **carriers** touched.

3. **Triad everywhere** — omitting **Work** entirely.
   **Fix:** Add the Work lane: timestamps, outcomes, Γ\_time coverage.

4. **Operator blur** — using one “process operator” for everything.
   **Fix:** Choose among **Γ\_method**, **Γ\_time**, **Γ\_work**, **Γ\_sys**.

5. **Set‑as‑collective** — a MemberOf set “decides”.
   **Fix:** Model a **collective system** with coordination Method.

6. **Unanchored evidence** — citing ideas without carriers.
   **Fix:** Add **SCR/RSCR** ids; tie claims to carriers.

7. **Holon/system drift** — “holon maintains temperature”.
   **Fix:** Say **system**; reserve “holon” for neutral mereology.

8. **Function/role swap in tables** — columns labelled “Function” but entries are roles.
   **Fix:** Rename column to **Role**; add a separate **Behaviour (Method/Work)** column.

9. **Process‑word leakage** — domain “process” used as FPF operator.
   **Fix:** Add parenthetical mapping at first use (Method/Work).

10. **Carrier/episteme swap** — “we versioned the model” meaning a file was renamed.
    **Fix:** State whether the **episteme content** changed; if only a carrier was renamed, say so.

| **Trustworthy evidence**     | Work + SCR anchoring makes claims auditable.      | Requires discipline → provide checklists.          |
| **Operator determinism**     | Correct Γ‑flavour selection preserves invariants. | A bit more modelling → reusable templates.         |
| **On‑ramp for managers**     | Canonical rewrites give immediate phrasing fixes. | Team training → this pattern is the training page. |

#### 11 · Rationale (informal)

* **Engineering cognition:** Large programmes fail less from equations than from category slips (“process vs procedure vs execution”). A.7 eliminates these slips by a small, repeatable grammar.
* **Compatible with ISO/BORO practice:** Distinguishing artefacts (specs), capabilities (procedures), and occurrences (operations) mirrors established systems‑engineering discipline while keeping FPF’s holonic rigor.
* **Didactic primacy:** Managers can approve sentences by spotting five tokens: **system bearing TransformerRole** / **Role** / **Method** / **Work** / **SCR**.

---

#### 12 · Relations

* **Builds on:** A.3 (Transformer Quartet), A.12 (Externalization & Reflexive Split), A.14 (Advanced Mereology), A.15 (Role–Method–Work Alignment), A.10 (Evidence & SCR).
* **Constrains:** A.13 (Agency sits on systems only; epistemes non‑behavioural), Part B operators (Γ\_method/Γ\_time/Γ\_work/Γ\_sys) and their choice points.

#### 13 · Manager’s one‑page review (copy‑paste)

**Approval sentence template**

> “The **system bearing TransformerRole** ⟨name⟩ plays ⟨Role⟩; it has **Method** ⟨M⟩ (from **MethodDescription** ⟨S⟩) and executed **Work** ⟨W⟩ on ⟨time⟩, anchored to ⟨SCR ids⟩; resources accounted via **Γ\_work**.”

**Five binary checks**

1. **Actor ban:** No “actor” token; canonical phrasing present.
2. **Clear trio:** MethodDescription / Method / Work are all named (as applicable) and not conflated.
3. **Right Γ:** Γ\_method for capability; Γ\_time for occurrence; Γ\_work for resources; Γ\_sys for system properties.
4. **Episteme handled:** Epistemes do not act; carriers listed (SCR).
5. **Group clarity:** Acting group is a **collective system**, not a MemberOf set.

**Diagram legend stub**

* “process (domain)” ⇒ Method (design‑time) / Work (run‑time).
* Role column lists masks (e.g., Cooling‑CirculatorRole).
* Behaviour column shows Method/Work, not the role itself.

### Pattern A.8 — Universal Core Principle (C‑1) \[A]

*“A principle that works in only one world is local folklore; a first principle architects every world.”*


#### 1 · Context

FPF aspires to be an **operating system for thought** that engineers, biologists, economists, and AI agents can all use without translation layers. That promise rests on the **universality** of its core primitives (`U.Type`s).  History is littered with “upper ontologies” that proclaimed universality yet smuggled in the biases of a single discipline; once deployed beyond their birthplace, they cracked or ballooned.  Rule C‑1 turns “universal” from a marketing word into a measurable criterion: *cross‑domain congruence*.

#### 4 · Solution — *The Three‑Domain Falsification Test*

> **Normative Rule (C‑1)** A `U.Type` **enters the kernel only if** it is shown to play the **same Role** in **at least three foundationally distinct domains**.

**Implementation steps**

1. **Domain Families** Choose any three from:
   *Exact Sciences* · *Natural Sciences* · *Engineering & Technology* · *Formal Sciences* · *Social & Behavioural Sciences*.

2. **Role‑Projection Records** For each domain, author a short **`Role‑Projection`** tuple: `{domain, indigenous term, Role, exemplar}`.
   *Example:* `{physics, "Free Energy", extremum driver, closed gas system}`.

3. **Congruence Check** All three exemplars must satisfy the **same abstract intent**; superficial analogy is rejected.

4. **Living Index** Track the ratio

   $$
     U\text{-Index}=\frac{\text{\# kernel types lacking 3 projections}}{\text{\# kernel types}}
   $$

   as a health signal; target ≤ 0.05 (not a bureaucratic gate).

*Rule of thumb for busy managers:* “**One idea, three worlds.** If you can’t point to the trio, park it in a plug‑in.”

---

#### 8 · Rationale

Deep research over the last decade shows *structural homologies* across domains:

* Free‑energy minimisation ↔ negative log‑likelihood ↔ Bayesian surprise (Friston 2023).
* Conservation laws in physics mirror budget balancing in economics (Rayo 2024).

By demanding three independent manifestations, FPF captures these convergences *without privileging* any single vocabulary.  The principle operationalises **Popperian falsifiability** for universality: a concept that cannot survive a three‑domain cross‑examination is, by definition, not a first principle.  This guards Pillars **P‑1 (Cognitive Elegance)** and **P‑4 (Open‑Ended Kernel)** simultaneously.

* **Energy ↔ Budget ↔ Attention** – Engineering teams reused `U.Resource` to reason about battery charge, project funds, and user‑attention minutes with one algebra, cutting integration effort by half (2024 pilot).
* **Objective unification** – An AI lab mapped *loss functions*, a bio‑lab mapped *Darwinian fitness*, and a factory mapped *scrap‑rate* all to `U.Objective`, enabling shared optimisation tooling.

These cases validated that the Three‑Domain Test is achievable in practice, not theoretical paperwork.

## A.9 Cross‑Scale Consistency (C‑3) \[A]

> *“The logic of a bolt must still be the logic of the bridge.”*

#### 1 · Context

FPF models reality as a **nested holarchy**: parts → assemblies → systems → supra‑systems; axioms → lemmas → theorems → paradigms. Designers and analysts must zoom freely without logical whiplash. Classical mereology and modern renormalisation theory both warn: if rules mutate across scales, predictions and audits collapse. FPF therefore mandates a single, scale‑invariant contract.

#### 4 · Solution — Invariant Quintet + Meta‑Holon Transition

##### 4.1 Invariant Quintet

Any aggregation operator `Γ` that claims FPF conformance **MUST** preserve these five invariants :

| Code     | Invariant             | One‑line Intuition                               |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **IDEM** | *Idempotence*         | Folding a singleton changes nothing.             |
| **COMM** | *Local Commutativity* | Order of independent folds is irrelevant.        |
| **LOC**  | *Locality*            | Worker or partition choice cannot affect result. |
| **WLNK** | *Weakest‑Link Bound*  | Whole never outperforms its frailest part.       |
| **MONO** | *Monotonicity*        | Improving a part cannot worsen the whole.        |

*Mnemonic:* **S‑O‑L‑I‑D** (Same · Order‑free · Location‑free · Inferior cap · Don’t‑regress).

**Inter‑Layer Contract note**
When holons are composed as a Layered‑Control stack, each Planner ↔ Regulator pair MUST publish an inter‑layer contract: {referenceSignal, guaranteedTrackingError, cycleTime}.  Matni 2024 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15185) prove such contracts satisfy COMM + LOC invariants, giving a constructive instance of the Quintet.

##### 4.2 Meta‑Holon Transition (MHT)

If empirical data show a true violation (e.g., redundancy raises WLNK limit), the modeller **declares an MHT**: the collection becomes a new holon tier, and the quintet applies anew at that scale .

### 8 · Rationale

*Post‑2015 evidence across domains*

* **Physics** ‑ Renormalisation coherence echoes IDEM, COMM, LOC.
* **Distributed data platforms** rely on COMM + LOC for deterministic aggregations.
* **Safety engineering** ‑ Fault‑tree analyses hinge on WLNK; aviation failures (2018‑24) confirm its necessity.
* **Lean improvement** ‑ MONO underpins Kaizen: fix a bottleneck, never worsen the plant.

Packaging these insights as one memorisable quintet → **Cognitive Elegance** with formal bite.

###  A.10 — Evidence Anchoring (C‑4) \[A]

*“A claim without a chain is only an opinion.”*

#### 1 · Context

FPF is a holonic framework: wholes are built from parts (A.1, A.14), and reasoning travels across scales via Γ‑flavours (B.1). To keep this reasoning honest and reproducible, every **published assertion** must be *anchored* in concrete **symbol carriers** and **well‑typed transformations** performed by an **external TransformerRole** (A.12, A.15).
Managers can read this as a simple rule of thumb:

> **Claim → (Proof or Test) → Confidence badge**
> …where the proof/test is traceable to real carriers and to an external system/Transformer who executed an agreed method.

This pattern defines the **Evidence Anchoring Contract** common to all Γ‑flavours (Γ\_sys — formerly Γ\_core, Γ\_epist, Γ\_method, Γ\_time, Γ\_work) and clarifies:
(a) the difference between **mereology** (part‑whole; builds holarchies) and **provenance** (why a claim is admissible; does *not* build holarchies);
(b) the run‑time / design‑time separation (A.4) across **Role–Method–Work** (A.15).

---

#### 2 · Problem

Without a uniform anchor, models drift into five failure modes:

1. **Weightless claims.** Metrics or arguments appear in the model with no link to their **symbol carriers** (files, datasets, lab notebooks, figures).
2. **Collapsed scopes.** Design‑time method specs are silently mixed with run‑time traces; results cannot be reproduced because “what was planned” and “what actually ran” are conflated.
3. **Self‑justifying loops.** A holon attempts to evidence itself (violates A.12 externality), producing cyclic provenance and unverifiable conclusions.
4. **Source loss during aggregation.** As Γ combines parts, some sources “fall out”; later audit cannot reconstruct why a compound claim was accepted.
5. **Temporal ambiguity.** Time‑series are aggregated without interval coverage or dating source; gaps/overlaps invalidate comparisons and trend claims.

The business effect is predictable: confidence badges cannot be defended, cross‑scale consistency (A.9) is broken, and iteration slows because every review re‑litigates “where did this come from?”.

#### 4 · Solution — The Evidence Anchoring Contract

The contract is a small set of primitives applied uniformly, with **manager‑first clarity** and **formal hooks** for proof obligations.

**4.1 EPV‑DAG (Evidence–Provenance DAG).**
A **typed, acyclic** graph disjoint from mereology. Node types: **SymbolCarrier** (a `U.System` in **CarrierRole**, A.15), **TransformerRole** (external Transformer, A.12), **MethodDescription** (design‑time blueprint of a method, A.15), **Observation** (a dated assertion/result), **U.Episteme** (knowledge holon). Edge vocabulary is small and normative: `evidences`, `derivedFrom`, `measuredBy`, `interpretedBy`, `usedCarrier`, `happenedBefore` (temporal), etc.
*Manager view:* it is the *“because‑graph”*: every claim answers “because of these carriers, by this Transformer, using that method, then.”

**4.2 Anchors (two relations, two flavours).**

* `verifiedBy` — links a claim to **formal** evidence (proof obligations, static guarantees, model‑checking artefacts).
* `validatedBy` — links a claim to **empirical** evidence (tests, measurements, trials, observations).
  Both anchors terminate in the EPV‑DAG, not in the mereology graph.

**4.3 SCR / RSCR (Symbol Carrier Registers).**
Every `Γ_epist` aggregation **SHALL** emit an **SCR**: an exhaustive register of **symbol carriers** materially used in the aggregate, with id, type, version/date, checksum, source/conditions and optional `PortionOf` (A.14) for sub‑carriers.
Every `Γ_epist^compile` **SHALL** emit an **RSCR**: SCR specialised to a **bounded context** (vocabularies, units) with publication‑grade identifiers and hashes.
*Why this matters:* it prevents “lost sources” during composition and underwrites reproducibility without mandating any specific tool.

**4.4 Scope alignment (A.4) across Role–Method–Work (A.15).**

* **Design‑time**: **MethodDescription** lives here; methods are blueprints; anchors reference what *would* constitute proof or test.
* **Run‑time**: **Work** (actual execution) lives here; traces reference which MethodDescription they instantiate and record `happenedBefore`.
  Bridging edges are explicit (“this run trace instantiates that spec”), so scopes never silently mix.

**4.5 External TransformerRole (A.12).**
The system that produces or interprets evidence is **external** to the holon under evaluation. If true reflexivity is essential, model a **meta‑holon** (A.12): the self‑updating holon becomes the *object* of a higher‑level external transformer (the “mirror”), restoring objectivity.

**4.6 Γ‑flavour hooks (how each flavour anchors).**

* **Γ\_sys (formerly Γ\_core)**: physical properties are anchored by measurement models, boundary conditions, calibration carriers, and dated observations.
* **Γ\_epist**: always outputs SCR/RSCR; every provenance/evidence node resolves to an SCR/RSCR entry.
* **Γ\_method**: order‑sensitive composition; at design‑time a **Method Instantiation Card (MIC)** states `Precedes/Choice/Join` and guards; at run‑time traces record `happenedBefore` and point to the MethodDescription they instantiate.
* **Γ\_time**: temporal claims state interval coverage; **Monotone Coverage** (no unexplained gaps/overlaps) is required.
* **Γ\_work**: resource spending and yield are evidenced by instrumented carriers (meters, logs) and their MethodDescriptions; keep **resource rosters** separate from SCR/RSCR.

> **Manager’s shortcut:** If you can answer *what carriers, which system, which method, when*, the anchor is likely sufficient; if any of the four is missing, it is not.

| **CC‑A10.1 (EPV‑DAG Presence)**         | Every published claim MUST have a path in the Evidence–Provenance DAG (EPV‑DAG) to concrete **SymbolCarrier** nodes and to the **external** `TransformerRole` that produced or interpreted the evidence.                                | Stops “weightless claims” and self‑justifying text.        |

| **CC‑A10.4 (Resolution)**               | Every provenance/evidence node in the dependency graph MUST be resolvable to an SCR/RSCR entry. Unresolved links invalidate the claim.                                                                                                  | Eliminates dangling references and unverifiable citations. |
| **CC‑A10.5 (Scope Separation)**         | A single EPV‑DAG instance SHALL NOT mix design‑time MethodDescription nodes with run‑time Work traces.

| **CC‑A10.6 (Externality)**              | The evidencing `TransformerRole` MUST be **external** to the holon under evaluation (A.12).

| **CC‑A10.9 (Holarchy Firewall)**        | EPV‑DAG MUST use provenance edges only; mereological edges (`ComponentOf`, `MemberOf`, `PortionOf`, `PhaseOf`, etc.) MUST NOT appear in EPV‑DAG; conversely, provenance edges MUST NOT be used to build holarchies.                     | Keeps part‑whole and evidence semantics disjoint.          |
| **CC‑A10.10 (Γ\_sys Anchors)**          | Physical claims aggregated by `Γ_sys` MUST reference measurement models (quantity, unit, uncertainty), boundary conditions, and calibration carriers.                                                                                   | Ensures physical plausibility and comparability.           |

#### 8 · Rationale (SoTA alignment, reader‑friendly)

* **Metrology & assurance.** The requirement to name quantities, units, uncertainty, calibration carriers reflects long‑standing metrology practice and modern assurance cases: numbers are only comparable when their **measurement models** are stated.
* **Knowledge provenance.** The EPV‑DAG and SCR/RSCR embody post‑2015 best practices in provenance for knowledge artefacts: keep a complete, machine‑checkable trail from claims to carriers; separate provenance from part‑whole.
* **Temporal reasoning.** Monotone coverage (no unexplained gaps/overlaps) aligns with temporal knowledge graph practice and avoids “impossible histories.”
* **Holonic parsimony.** By drawing a firewall between **mereology** (A.14) and **provenance**, A.10 prevents semantic leakage and keeps the holarchy well‑typed.
* **Role–Method–Work clarity.** Anchoring explicitly rides on A.15: **roles** act via **methods** specified at design‑time and produce **work** observed at run‑time. This keeps agency, policy, and execution disentangled yet connected.

#### 9 · Relations

* **Builds on:** A.1 Holonic Foundation; A.4 Temporal Duality; **A.12 Transformer Externalization**; **A.14 Advanced Mereology**; **A.15 Role–Method–Work Alignment**.
* **Constrains / Used by:** B.1 (all Γ‑flavours: `Γ_sys`, `Γ_epist`, `Γ_method`, `Γ\_time`, `Γ_work`); B.1.1 (Dependency Graph & Proofs).
* **Enables:** **B.3 Trust Calculus** (R/CL inputs, auditability); B.4 Canonical Evolution Loop (clean design/run bridges).

#### 10 · Migration (this draft, practical and brief)

Apply these text edits **only** in the holonic working file:

1. **Terminology**

   * `manifest` → **“Symbol Carrier Register (SCR)”**; `release manifest` → **“Release SCR (RSCR)”**.
   * `creator` / `observer` (as internal evidencer) → **`TransformerRole (external)`**.
   * “symbol register” (ambiguous) → **“Symbol Carrier Register (SCR)”**.
   * Keep **resource rosters** in `Γ_work` separate from SCR/RSCR.

2. **Γ naming**

   * `Γ_core` (legacy) → **`Γ_sys`** everywhere (note once: *formerly Γ\_core*).

3. **Boilerplate inserts**

   * In **A.10** (this pattern): retain definitions of **EPV‑DAG**, **SCR/RSCR**, and the flavour‑specific anchors.
   * In **B.1.3 (`Γ_epist`)**: add the **Obligations — SCR/RSCR** block (“`Γ_epist^synth` SHALL output SCR… `Γ_epist^compile` SHALL output RSCR…”).
   * In **B.1.5 (`Γ_method`)**: ensure **MIC** is referenced (Precedes/Choice/Join, guards, exceptions) and run‑time traces reference the **MethodDescription** they instantiate.
   * In **B.1.6 (`Γ_work`)**: say “resource rosters are not SCR/RSCR; anchor meter/log readings via EPV‑DAG.”


### Pattern A.11 — Ontological Parsimony (C‑5) \[A]

*“Add only what you cannot subtract.”*


#### 1 · Context

The FPF kernel aspires to remain **small enough to learn in a week** yet **broad enough** to model engines, proofs and budgets alike. Unchecked growth of primitives—well‑known from earlier “enterprise ontologies”—bloats diagrams, stalls tooling and intimidates new adopters. C‑5 therefore demands *minimal‑sufficiency*: a new core concept enters the kernel **only** when all routes of composition, refinement or role‑projection fail to express it without semantic loss.

### **Pattern A.12 — External Transformer & Reflexive Split \[A]**

#### 1 · Intent & Context

The principle of causality is the bedrock of engineering and scientific reasoning: every change has a cause. In FPF, this translates to a strict architectural rule: **no "self-magic."** An action cannot happen without an actor. This pattern establishes the formal mechanism for modeling causality, ensuring that every transformation is attributed to an explicit, external agent.

This pattern operationalizes the **Agent Externalization Principle (C-2)**. It builds directly upon:
*   **A.3 (Transformer Constitution):** Which defines the core quartet of action: the `Agent` (who acts), the `MethodDescription` (the recipe), the `Method` (the capability), and the `Work` (the event).
*   **A.2 (Contextual Role Assignment):** Which provides the universal syntax `Holder#Role:Context` for defining agents.

The intent of this pattern is twofold:
1.  To mandate that every transformation is modeled as an interaction between a distinct **Agent** (playing a `TransformerRole`) and a distinct **Target** across a defined **Boundary**.
2.  To provide a rigorous pattern, the **Reflexive Split**, for modeling systems that appear to act upon themselves (e.g., self-calibration, self-repair) without violating the principle of external causality.

#### 2 · Problem

Without a strict rule of agent externalization, models become ambiguous and untraceable, leading to critical failures in design and audit:

1.  **Causality Collapse ("Self-Magic"):** Phrases like "the system configures itself" or "the document updates itself" create a causal black hole. It becomes impossible to answer the question, "What *caused* this change?" This makes debugging, root cause analysis, and assigning responsibility impossible.
2.  **Audit Dead-Ends:** An auditor tracing a change finds that the system is its own justification. There is no external evidence, no log from an independent actor, and therefore, no way to verify the integrity of the transformation. This is a direct violation of **Evidence Anchoring (A.10)**.
3.  **Hidden Dependencies:** In a "self-healing" system, the healing mechanism (the regulator) and the operational part (the regulated) are modeled as a single monolithic block. This hides the critical internal dependency between them. A failure in the regulator might go unnoticed until the entire system collapses, because its role was never made explicit.

#### 3 · Forces

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Causal Clarity vs. Modeling Simplicity** | The need to explicitly model every cause-and-effect link vs. the desire to keep diagrams simple by representing self-regulating systems as single blocks. |
| **Objectivity vs. Internal States** | The need for an external, objective observer/actor to ground all claims vs. the reality that many systems have internal feedback loops that control their own state. |
| **Accountability vs. Automation** | In fully automated systems, it can be tempting to say "the system did it," but for assurance and safety, we must always be able to trace an action back to a specific, responsible component. |

#### 4. Solution

The solution is a two-part architectural mandate: **(1)** all transformations must be modeled with an external agent, and **(2)** apparent self-transformation must be modeled using the **Reflexive Split**.

#### 4.1 The Principle of the External Transformer

Every transformation in FPF is a `U.Work` event that is the result of an **Agent** acting upon a **Target**.

*   **The Agent:** The agent is a **Contextual Role Assignment** of the form `System#TransformerRole:Context`. This is the cause, the "doer."
*   **The Target:** The target is the `U.Holon` being changed. This can be another `U.System` or the **symbol carrier** of a `U.Episteme`.
*   **The Boundary:** The agent and the target are always separated by a `U.Boundary` and interact through a `U.Interaction`.

**Crucial Rule:** The `holder` of the Agent's `U.RoleAssignment` **cannot** be the same holon instance as the Target.
> `holder(Agent) ≠ Target`

This simple inequality is the core of the externalization principle. It constitutionally forbids self-magic.

##### 4.1.1 Reflexivity vs cross‑reference (normative note)

FPF distinguishes **reflexive transformation** from **episteme‑level reference**.  
*Reflexive* cases (e.g., “self‑calibration”) MUST be modeled by the **Reflexive Split** (Regulator→Regulated) and remain within the **world** ReferencePlane.  
When a claim **refers to** another claim/episteme, model it with **epistemeAbout(x,y)** and set **ReferencePlane(x)=episteme**. Such references **do not perform transformations** and **MUST NOT** be used to bypass the external‑agent rule. Evaluation of chains of episteme‑about relations MUST remain **acyclic within a single evaluation chain**; otherwise, abstain and request a split or external evidence.


#### 4.2 The Reflexive Split Pattern

So, how do we model a system that *does* act on itself, like a self-calibrating sensor? We use the **Reflexive Split**. We recognize that the system is not a monolith; it contains at least two distinct functional parts.

**The Procedure:**

1.  **Identify the Roles:** Decompose the system's function into two distinct roles: the part that *regulates* and the part that *is regulated*.
2.  **Model as Two Holons:** Model these two parts as two distinct (though possibly tightly coupled) `U.System` holons, even if they share the same physical casing.
3.  **Define the Internal Boundary:** Model the interface between them as an internal `U.Boundary` with a defined `U.Interaction` (e.g., a data bus, a mechanical linkage).
4.  **Assign the Transformer Role:** The regulating part becomes the `holder` of the `TransformerRole`. The regulated part becomes the `Target`.

Now, the "self-action" is modeled as a standard, external transformation that just happens to occur *inside* the larger system's boundary. Causality is restored, and the model becomes auditable.

**Didactic Note for Engineers & Managers: The "Two Hats" Analogy**

Think of the Reflexive Split like a manager who needs to review their own work. To do it properly, they must metaphorically wear "two hats."
*   **Hat 1: The Doer.** They perform the task.
*   **Hat 2: The Reviewer.** They step back, put on their "reviewer hat," and inspect the work *as if* it were done by someone else.

The Reflexive Split formalizes this. The "Doer" is the **Regulated** subsystem. The "Reviewer" is the **Regulator** subsystem, which plays the `TransformerRole`. By modeling them as two separate entities, we make the internal quality control loop explicit and prevent the logical error of a system magically grading its own homework.

#### 5 · Archetypal Grounding

The principle of external causality and the Reflexive Split pattern are universal. They apply equally to physical systems, epistemic artifacts, and socio-technical organizations.

| Scenario | Naive Description ("Self-Magic") | FPF Model with Reflexive Split | `Agent` & `Target` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System Archetype** | "The robot calibrates itself." | The robot is modeled as a composite holon containing two subsystems: <br> 1. **`CalibrationController`** (`U.System`) <br> 2. **`SensorSuite`** (`U.System`) <br> They interact across an internal data bus (`U.Boundary`). | **Agent:** `CalibrationController#TransformerRole:RobotInternals` <br> **Target:** `SensorSuite` |
| **Episteme Archetype** | "The document automatically updates its cross-references." | The "document" is a system comprising: <br> 1. **`UpdateScript`** (a `U.System` that executes code) <br> 2. **`DocumentFile.xml`** (a `U.System` acting as a symbol carrier) <br> They interact via the file system (`U.Boundary`). | **Agent:** `UpdateScript#TransformerRole:DocumentSystem` <br> **Target:** `DocumentFile.xml` (the carrier of the `U.Episteme`) |
| **Socio-Technical Archetype** | "The team reviews its own performance." | The team is modeled as a collective `U.System` that enacts two roles at different times: <br> 1. **`ExecutionTeam`** (doing the sprint work) <br> 2. **`ReviewTeam`** (conducting the retrospective) <br> The "boundary" is the formal separation created by the retrospective ceremony. | **Agent:** `Team#ReviewerRole:RetrospectiveContext` <br> **Target:** The `U.Work` logs and artifacts produced by the `Team#ExecutionRole`. |

**Key takeaway from grounding:**
These examples demonstrate that there is *no such thing as self-action* in a well-formed model. Every action, even an internal one, can and must be decomposed into an external interaction between a distinct agent and a distinct target. This makes the causal chain explicit and auditable in all domains.

#### 6 · Conformance Checklist

To enforce the principles of externalization and causal clarity, all FPF models must adhere to the following normative checks.

| ID | Requirement (Normative Predicate) | Purpose / Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CC-A12.1 (External Agent Mandate)** | Every transformation (`U.Work`) **MUST** be attributed to an Agent (`U.RoleAssignment`) whose `holder` is distinct from the target holon. | This is the core rule that forbids self-magic. It ensures every action has an identifiable, external cause. |
| **CC-A12.2 (Reflexive Split for Self-Action)** | Any narrative of "self-modification" (e.g., self-repair, self-configuration) **MUST** be modeled using the Reflexive Split pattern. | Forces the modeler to make internal control loops explicit by identifying the distinct `Regulator` (Agent) and `Regulated` (Target) subsystems. |
| **CC-A12.3 (Boundary Explicitness)** | The `U.Boundary` and `U.Interaction` between the Agent and the Target **MUST** be explicitly modeled. | Makes interfaces a first-class citizen of the model. Prevents hidden dependencies and ensures interactions are auditable. |
| **CC-A12.4 (Episteme Carrier as Target)** | When a `U.Episteme` is modified, the `Target` of the transformation **MUST** be its **symbol carrier** (`U.System`), not the `U.Episteme` itself. | Reinforces **Strict Distinction (A.7)**. Knowledge doesn't change by magic; a physical agent must act on its physical representation. |
| **CC-A12.5 (No Self-Evidence)** | The Agent that performs a transformation **cannot** be the sole source of evidence for the success or properties of that transformation. Evidence **MUST** be anchored via an independent `Observer`. | Prevents conflicts of interest in assurance. The `Transformer` does the work; a separate `Observer` (another RoleAssignment) validates it. This aligns with **A.10 (Evidence Anchoring)**. |

#### 7 · Consequences

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Causal Traceability & Auditability:** Every change is linked to a specific agent and interaction, creating a complete and unambiguous audit trail. This is essential for root cause analysis and accountability. | **Increased Model Granularity:** The Reflexive Split requires creating more model elements than a simple monolithic block. *Mitigation:* This is not a bug, but a feature. The "extra" elements represent real, critical parts of the system's architecture that were previously hidden. FPF tooling can help manage this via views that can "collapse" a split system for high-level diagrams. |
| **Architectural Honesty:** The pattern forces designers to be explicit about internal control loops, interfaces, and dependencies, leading to more robust and well-understood system architectures. | **Requires a Shift in Thinking:** Modelers accustomed to "self-x" narratives must learn to think in terms of external interactions. *Mitigation:* The "Two Hats" analogy and clear archetypes (Section 5) serve as powerful didactic tools to facilitate this shift. |
| **Enables True Modularity:** By making interfaces explicit, the pattern supports modular design. A `Regulator` subsystem could potentially be swapped out for a different one as long as it respects the same `U.Interaction` contract. | - |
| **Unlocks Deeper Analysis:** Once an internal control loop is made explicit, it can be formally analyzed for stability, performance, and failure modes using tools like the Supervisor-Subsystem Feedback Loop pattern (B.2.5). | - |

#### 8 · Rationale

The principle of externalization is not an arbitrary rule imposed by FPF; it is a distillation of foundational concepts from multiple rigorous disciplines.

*   **Cybernetics & Control Theory:** As Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety and modern control theory (e.g., Matni et al., 2024) demonstrate, regulation is fundamentally an **interaction across a boundary** between a controller and a plant. Conflating the two hides the causal structure and makes stability analysis impossible. The Reflexive Split is the FPF's implementation of this core cybernetic principle.
*   **Physics (Constructor Theory):** As discussed in A.3, Constructor Theory recasts physics in terms of what transformations are possible. A transformation is always performed by a "constructor" (our `Transformer`) on a substrate. The theory does not contain "self-constructing" substrates. FPF's externalist stance is fully aligned with this physical worldview.
*   **Philosophy of Science (Objectivity):** The scientific method is built on the principle of external observation and verification. A theory cannot validate itself; its predictions must be checked by an independent experiment. The `No Self-Evidence` rule (CC-A12.5) is the direct implementation of this principle in the FPF's assurance calculus.
*   **Software Engineering (Dependency Inversion):** The principle that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions, is a form of externalization. It enforces clean separation and makes systems more modular and testable. The explicit `U.Boundary` in our pattern serves the same architectural purpose as a well-defined interface in software.

By mandating externalization, FPF is not adding bureaucratic overhead. It is enforcing a set of first principles that are demonstrably essential for building complex systems that are understandable, auditable, and trustworthy.

## A.13 The Agential Role & Agency Spectrum \[A]

> *“Agency is not a kind of thing; it is a way some systems operate.”*

### 1 · Intent & Context

The concept of "agency"—the capacity of an entity to act purposefully—is central to engineering, biology, and AI, yet it remains one of the most overloaded and ambiguous terms. Without a precise, falsifiable, and substrate-neutral definition, models of autonomous systems risk descending into "self-magic," where actions have no clear cause and accountability is lost.

This pattern builds directly upon the foundations laid in the FPF Kernel to provide that definition. A.1 established that only a **`U.System`** can be the bearer (`holder`) of behavioral roles.  A.2.1 defined the universal `U.RoleAssignment` (`Holder#Role:Context`) as the canonical way to assign roles. A.3 and A.12 defined the `TransformerRole` and the principle of the external agent.

The intent of this pattern is to:
1.  Formally define **agency** not as an intrinsic *type* of holon, but as a **contextual Role Assignment**.
2.  Introduce a measurable, multi-dimensional **spectrum of agency** via a dedicated Characterization (`Agency-CHR`), moving beyond a simple binary "agent/not-agent" switch.
3.  Provide a clear, **didactic grading system** that allows engineers and managers to assess and communicate the level of autonomy of any system in a consistent, evidence-backed manner.

### 2 · Problem

If agency is treated as a monolithic, intrinsic property or a mere label, four critical failure modes emerge, undermining the rigor of FPF:

1.  **Episteme-as-Actor:** Models might incorrectly assign agency to knowledge artifacts (`U.Episteme`), leading to nonsensical claims like "the specification decided to update the system." This is a direct violation of **Strict Distinction (A.7)**.
2.  **Type Inflation:** Introducing a `U.Agent` as a new base type alongside `U.System` and `U.Episteme` would violate **Ontological Parsimony (C-5)** and create conflicts with the dynamic nature of roles. A system might act as an agent in one context and a passive component in another; a static type cannot capture this.
3.  **Unfalsifiable Claims:** Without a measurable basis, "agency" becomes a subjective label. A team might call their system an "agent" for marketing purposes, but this claim has no verifiable meaning and cannot be audited, violating **Evidence Anchoring (A.10)**.
4.  **The Binary Trap:** A simple "agent/not-agent" classification is too coarse. It fails to distinguish between a simple thermostat, a predictive cruise control system, and a strategic, self-learning robotic swarm, even though their cognitive capabilities differ by orders of magnitude.

### 3 · Forces

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Scientific Fidelity vs. Simplicity** | Contemporary science (e.g., Active Inference) models agency as a continuous, scale-free spectrum. FPF needs to honor this rigor while providing a simple, teachable model for practitioners. |
| **Role vs. Type** | The intuition is to think of an "Agent" as a *type* of thing. FPF's architecture demands that it be modeled as a *role* to preserve dynamism and ontological hygiene. |
| **Measurement vs. Label** | Engineers and managers need a quick, intuitive label (e.g., "this is a Level 3 agent"), while formal assurance requires a detailed, multi-dimensional, evidence-backed measurement. |
| **System-only Action vs. Collective Action**| How does agency apply to groups like teams or swarms? This requires a clear link to the rule from A.1 that any *acting group* must be modeled as a `U.System`. |

### 4 · Solution

FPF's solution is threefold: it defines an Agent via `U.RoleAssignment` (A.2.1), makes agency measurable with a dedicated Characterization, and provides a didactic summary via a graded scale.

#### 4.1 The Core Definition: Agent as a Contextual Role Assignment

An **"Agent"** in FPF is not a fundamental type. It is a convenience term (a Register 1 / Register 2 label) for a specific kind of **Contextual Role Assignment (`U.RoleAssignment`)**:

> `Agent ≍ U.RoleAssignment(holder: U.System, role: U.AgentialRole, context: U.BoundedContext)`

This means an Agent is simply a **`U.System`** that is currently playing an **`AgentialRole`** within a specific **`U.BoundedContext`**.

*   **No `U.Agent` Type:** To be clear, there is **no `U.Agent` base type** in the FPF Kernel. This avoids type inflation and preserves the dynamic nature of roles.
*   **Epistemes Cannot Be Agents:** As the `holder` must be a `U.System`, this definition constitutionally forbids `U.Episteme`s from being agents, preventing the "episteme-as-actor" category error.
*   **Canonical Syntax:** The technical notation for an agent is `System#AgentialRole:Context`.

#### 4.2 The `AgentialRole` and its Specializations

*   **`U.AgentialRole`:** This is the abstract `U.Role` that grants a `U.System` the capacity for goal-directed action within a context. It is the "license to act."
*   **Specialized Roles:** More specific behavioral roles like `TransformerRole` and `ObserverRole` are considered **specializations or sub-roles** of `AgentialRole`. They describe *what kind* of agential action is being performed at a given moment.
    *   A system playing `TransformerRole` is an Agent *that is currently modifying another holon*.
    *   A system playing `ObserverRole` is an Agent *that is currently gathering information*.
    This creates a clean hierarchy: a `Transformer` is always an `Agent`, but an `Agent` is not always a `Transformer` (it could be observing, planning, or idle).

#### 4.3 Measuring Agency: The `Agency-CHR` and the Spectrum

Agency is not a binary switch; it is a multi-dimensional spectrum of capabilities. FPF models this using a dedicated architheory, **`Agency-CHR` (C.9)**, which is a **Characterization** that attaches a set of measurable properties to a `U.RoleAssignment`.

The `Agency-CHR` profile is grounded in contemporary research (e.g., Active Inference, Basal Cognition) and includes the following key characteristics. Each is measured for a specific agent in a specific context and must be backed by evidence (A.10).

1.  **Boundary Maintenance Capacity (BMC):** The ability of the system to maintain its structural and functional integrity against perturbations. *(How robust is it?)*
2.  **Predictive Horizon (PH):** The temporal or causal depth of the agent's internal model. *(How far ahead can it "see"?)*
3.  **Model Plasticity (MP):** The rate at which the agent can update its internal model (`U.GenerativeModel`) in response to prediction errors (`U.Error`). *(How quickly can it learn?)*
4.  **Policy Enactment Reliability (PER):** The probability that the agent will successfully execute its chosen `U.Method` under operational conditions. *(How reliably does it do what it decides to do?)*
5.  **Objective Complexity (OC):** A measure of the complexity of the `U.Objective` the agent can pursue, from simple set-points to abstract, multi-scale goals.

#### 4.4 The Agency Grade (Didactic Layer)

While the multi-dimensional `Agency-CHR` profile is essential for formal assurance, engineers and managers need a simpler, at-a-glance summary. The **Agency Grade** is a **non-normative, didactic** scale from 0 to 4 that synthesizes the CHR profile into an intuitive level of autonomy.

| Grade | Label | Typical `Agency-CHR` Profile (Conservative Lower Bound) | Archetypal Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | **Non-Agential** | `BMC ≈ 0`, `PH ≈ 0`, `MP ≈ 0` | A rock, a document, a passive structural component. |
| **1** | **Reactive** | `BMC > 0`, `PH ≈ 0`, `MP ≈ 0` | A thermostat; a simple feedback controller. Follows fixed rules. |
| **2** | **Predictive** | `BMC > 0`, `PH > 0`, `MP ≈ 0` | A model-predictive controller with a fixed model; a chess engine that plans moves but doesn't learn new strategies. |
| **3** | **Adaptive** | `BMC > 0`, `PH > 0`, `MP > 0` | A self-calibrating sensor system; a machine learning agent that updates its model with new data. |
| **4** | **Reflective/Strategic** | High `BMC`, `PH`, `MP`, `PER`, and `OC`. Capable of meta-cognition (reasoning about its own reasoning) and pursuing abstract goals. | An autonomous R&D system; a cohesive, self-organizing DevOps team. |

**Crucial Distinction:** The `Agency-CHR` profile is the **normative evidence**. The Grade is a **pedagogical shortcut**. An artifact cannot claim a grade without having a corresponding, auditable CHR profile to back it up.

#### 5 · Archetypal Grounding

The universal pattern of agency, defined as a `Contextual Role Assignment` and measured by the `Agency-CHR`, manifests across all domains. The following table demonstrates its application to the FPF's two primary archetypes: a `U.System` and a collective `U.System` (a team), while explicitly showing why a `U.Episteme` cannot be an agent.

| Archetype | Holder (`U.System`) | Role & Context (`#Role:Context`) | `Agency-CHR` Profile Sketch | Resulting Agency Grade |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Simple Controller** | `Thermostat_Model_T800` | `#AgentialRole:HomeHeatingSystem` | `BMC`: High (maintains temp). <br> `PH`: Zero (no prediction). <br> `MP`: Zero (fixed logic). <br> `PER`: Very High. <br> `OC`: Low (single set-point). | **Grade 1 (Reactive)** |
| **Advanced Controller** | `PredictiveCruiseControl_v3` | `#AgentialRole:VehicleDynamics` | `BMC`: High. <br> `PH`: High (predicts traffic flow). <br> `MP`: Zero (fixed model). <br> `PER`: High. <br> `OC`: Medium (optimization). | **Grade 2 (Predictive)** |
| **Learning System** | `SelfCalibratingSensorArray` | `#AgentialRole:IndustrialProcess` | `BMC`: High. <br> `PH`: High. <br> `MP`: Medium (learns drift). <br> `PER`: High. <br> `OC`: Medium. | **Grade 3 (Adaptive)** |
| **Collective Agent** | `DevOpsTeam_Phoenix` (a collective `U.System`) | `#AgentialRole:ProjectPhoenix` | `BMC`: High (maintains velocity). <br> `PH`: High (sprint planning). <br> `MP`: High (retrospectives). <br> `PER`: Medium-High. <br> `OC`: High (abstract business goals). | **Grade 4 (Reflective/Strategic)** |
| **Knowledge Artifact** | `ISO_26262_Standard.pdf` (`U.Episteme`) | **N/A** (Cannot be a holder of an `AgentialRole`) | N/A | **Grade 0 (Non-Agential)** |

**Key takeaway from grounding:**
This table makes the abstract model concrete. It shows that the FPF agency model can precisely differentiate between simple controllers and complex learning systems. It also reinforces the **Strict Distinction** principle: the ISO standard (`U.Episteme`) is a crucial **justification (`justification?`)** for the actions of an agent (like the DevOps team), but it is never an agent itself.

#### 6 · Conformance Checklist

To ensure the agency model is applied rigorously and consistently, all FPF artifacts must adhere to the following normative checks.

| ID | Requirement (Normative Predicate) | Purpose / Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CC-A13.1 (Holder Type)** | The `holder` of a `U.RoleAssignment` with `role: U.AgentialRole` **MUST** be a `U.System`. | Prevents the "episteme-as-actor" category error. Enforces **Strict Distinction (A.7)**. |
| **CC-A13.2 (RoleAssignment Mandate)** | Any claim of agency **MUST** be represented by a complete `U.RoleAssignment` instance, including an explicit `holder`, `role`, and `context`. | Ensures that agency is always modeled as contextual and bound to a specific bearer, not as a free-floating property. |
| **CC-A13.3 (CHR Evidence)** | Any claim about an Agent's grade or level of autonomy **MUST** be substantiated by an auditable `Agency-CHR` profile with evidence anchors (A.10). | Makes claims of agency falsifiable and prevents "agency by marketing." |
| **CC-A13.4 (Grade is Didactic)**| The **Agency Grade (0-4)** **SHALL NOT** be used as a normative input for formal reasoning. It is a didactic summary of the `Agency-CHR` profile. | Prevents oversimplification in formal models. The detailed profile, not the summary grade, must be used for assurance cases. |
| **CC-A13.5 (Collective as System)** | To claim agency for a collective (e.g., a team, a swarm), the collective **MUST** first be modeled as a `U.System` with a defined `U.Boundary` and a coordination `U.Method`. | Prevents the error of assigning agency to a mere set or collection (`MemberOf`). Aligns with **A.1** and **A.14**. |
| **CC-A13.6 (MHT for Emergent Agency)** | If a collection of systems, previously non-agential or at a lower grade, develops a new supervisory structure and crosses a documented `Agency-CHR` threshold, a **Meta-Holon Transition (MHT, B.2)** **MUST** be declared. | Makes the emergence of collective agency an explicit, auditable event, preventing "magic" emergence. |

#### 7 · Consequences

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Category Safety & Clarity:** The pattern provides a clear, unambiguous definition of agency that prevents common modeling errors and is consistent across all of FPF. | **Increased Modeling Granularity:** Requires modelers to think in terms of Role-assignments and contexts, which is slightly more complex than just labeling something an "Agent." *Mitigation:* The `Holon#Role:Context` syntax and tooling support make this manageable in practice. |
| **Falsifiable & Measurable Agency:** By grounding agency in the `Agency-CHR`, the framework transforms a vague philosophical concept into a set of concrete, evidence-backed engineering properties. | **Measurement Effort:** Populating the `Agency-CHR` profile requires real work (testing, analysis, data gathering). *Mitigation:* The profile can be built iteratively. An initial estimate can be used, with the understanding that its `Reliability (R)` score is low until backed by evidence. |
| **Scalable Autonomy Model:** The graded scale provides a sophisticated language for describing and comparing different levels of autonomy, from simple automation to strategic intelligence. | **Risk of Misinterpreting Grades:** The simple 0-4 scale could be misused as a simplistic marketing label. *Mitigation:* The normative requirement (**CC-A13.4**) to always link a grade to its underlying CHR profile acts as a guardrail against this. |
| **Elegant Handling of Collectives:** The pattern provides a clean way to model the agency of teams, swarms, and organizations without violating ontological principles. | - |

#### 8 · Rationale

This pattern's strength comes from its synthesis of contemporary, post-2015 research into a single, operational model.

*   **Grounded in Science:** The move away from a binary, type-based view of agency towards a **graded, spectrum-based model** is directly aligned with modern research in Active Inference (Friston et al.), Basal Cognition (Fields, Levin), and evolutionary cybernetics. The `Agency-CHR` provides a direct, practical implementation of these ideas.
*   **Ontologically Sound:** By defining an Agent as a **Contextual Role Assignment**, the pattern avoids the ontological pitfalls of creating a new base type. It fully embraces the FPF's core architectural principle of separating **substance (`holder`)** from **function (`role`)** within a **context**. This aligns with best practices from foundational ontologies (like UFO) and the principles of **Strict Distinction (A.7)**.
*   **Pragmatic and Actionable:** The pattern is designed for engineers and managers. The `Agency Grade` provides a quick communication tool, while the underlying `Agency-CHR` provides the detailed, auditable data needed for formal assurance and risk management. This duality satisfies both **Didactic Primacy (P-2)** and **Pragmatic Utility (P-7)**.

In essence, this pattern does not *invent* a new theory of agency. It **distills and operationalizes** the emerging scientific consensus, packaging it into a rigorous, falsifiable, and practical tool for the FPF ecosystem.

#### 9 · Relations

*   **Builds on:**
    *   `A.1 Holonic Foundation`: Establishes that only `U.System`s can be bearers of behavioral roles.
    *   `A.2 Role Taxonomy`: Provides the universal  Contextual Role Assignment (`U.RoleAssignment`) mechanism.
    *   `A.12 External Transformer`: The actions of an Agent are modeled using the external transformer principle.
*   **Coordinates with:**
    *   `B.2 Meta-Holon Transition (MHT)`: A significant jump in the `Agency-CHR` of a collective can trigger an MHT.
    *   `B.3 Trust & Assurance Calculus`: The `Agency-CHR` profile provides crucial inputs for assessing the reliability and safety of an autonomous system.
    *   `D.2 Multi-Scale Ethics Framework`: The Agency Grade is used to determine the level of moral responsibility and accountability assigned to a system.
*   **Instantiates:**
    *   The `Agency-CHR` (C.9) architheory, which provides the formal definitions for the characteristics (BMC, PH, etc.).

# A.14 — Advanced Mereology: Components, Portions, Aspects & Phases  \[A]


#### 1 · Context — why an advanced mereology?

FPF’s holonic world is built from **part–whole** relations. Early drafts distinguished structural vs. conceptual parthood (e.g., **ComponentOf**, **ConstituentOf**) but practical modelling kept hitting two recurrent gaps:

1. **Quantities vs. parts.** Engineers routinely need “some of the fuel”, “the first 10 pages”, “a 30% subset of data”. This is not a component; it is a **portion** of a stuff‑like whole, governed by measures and conservation.

2. **Change vs. replacement.** Authors need to say “the prototype **before calibration**”, “v2 of the spec”, “shift 1 vs. shift 2 of the same run”. That is not a new whole; it is a **phase** of the same carrier across time.

This section introduces two **normative** sub‑relations of `partOf` that close those gaps and lock them to the rest of the kernel:

* **PortionOf** — metrical, measure‑preserving parthood of stuffs and other measurables.
* **PhaseOf** — temporal parthood of the *same* carrier across an interval.

It also restates guard‑rails that keep **roles** and **recipes** outside mereology (A.15), and clarifies how **MemberOf** fits (preview: **collections** are grounded constructively in **C.13 Compose‑CAL** via `Γ_m.set`; **collective agency** is handled outside mereology in **A.15 Role–Method–Work**).

**Publication note (Working‑Model first).** Read A.14 together with **E.14 Human‑Centric Working‑Model** and **B.3.5 CT2R‑LOG**: publish relations on the **Working‑Model** surface; when assurance is sought, **ground downward**. For structural claims that require extensional identity, use the **Constructive** shoulder via **Compose‑CAL Γ_m (sum | set | slice)**; order/time stay outside mereology (Γ_time / Γ_method).

#### 2 · Problem — what breaks without these distinctions?

If we only have “generic partOf” (plus Component/Constituent), four classes of errors appear:

1. **Conservation errors.** Treating “20 L of fuel from Tank A” as a component leads to nonsense: adding and removing such “components” does not respect quantities; Γ\_sys proofs violate Σ‑balance.

2. **Temporal smearing.** Flattening “before/after”, or “v1/v2” into one timeless whole collapses history; Γ\_time and Γ\_method cannot justify order‑sensitive properties; audits cannot reproduce conditions.

3. **Identity confusion.** Modelling “new version” as “new component” either breaks identity (it is still the *same* holon evolving) or hides a **Meta‑Holon Transition** when identity really changes.

4. **Role leakage.** Functional/organisational roles sneak into part trees (“the PumpRole is part of the plant”), violating A.15 and making structural reasoning brittle.

| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Expressiveness vs. Parsimony**   | We need new relations (Portion, Phase) ↔ we must keep the catalogue minimal and orthogonal.                     |
| **Universality vs. Domain nuance** | One set of rules must serve physical systems and epistemes ↔ measurement and time behave differently by domain. |
| **Identity vs. Change**            | Preserve “the same carrier through change” ↔ allow explicit re‑identification when invariants fail.             |
| **Static structure vs. Histories** | Part trees should be simple ↔ real work requires phased histories and measured slices.                          |

#### 4 · Solution — extend the mereology catalogue, keep it clean

**A.14 defines two additional sub‑relations of `partOf`** and **re‑affirms the firewall** between mereology and the role/recipe layer:

1. **PortionOf** — for *measured* parts of a whole (stuffs and other extensives).
2. **PhaseOf** — for *temporal* parts of the same carrier.
3. **No roles/recipes in mereology.** `U.Role`, `U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription` are **never** parts (A.15).
4. **MemberOf stays, but constructive aggregation and agency live elsewhere.** `MemberOf` remains available to state collections and collectives; **their collection‑as‑whole may be constructed via Γ\_m.set (Compose‑CAL, C.13)**, while **composition and agency are handled in B.1.7 Γ\_collective** (not in A.14).

The classical pair **ComponentOf** (structural, discrete) and **ConstituentOf** (conceptual, logical/epistemic) remain as in the kernel; A.14 only clarifies **how to tell them apart from Portion/Phase** (§ 6).

#### 5 · Formal cores (normative semantics)

##### 5.1 PortionOf — metrical part of a measurable whole

**Intent.** Capture “some of the same stuff/extent”, governed by a measure that adds up.

**Applicability.** Any `U.Holon` that carries an **extensive** measure μ on the chosen scope
(examples: mass, volume, length‑of‑text, byte size, wall‑time budget).

**Primitive.** `PortionOf(x, y)` means: *x is the same kind of stuff/content as y, but less*.

**Axioms (A14‑POR‑\*)**

* **POR‑1 (Partial order).** PortionOf is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive on its domain.
* **POR‑2 (Metrical dominance).** If `x ProperPortionOf y` then `0 < μ(x) < μ(y)` for the agreed μ.
* **POR‑3 (Additivity on disjoint portions).** If `x ⟂ y` (no overlap) and both PortionOf y, then `μ(x ⊔ y) = μ(x)+μ(y)` and `x ⊔ y PortionOf y`.
* **POR‑4 (Kind integrity).** x and y must share the same **measure kind** and **unit** (or a declared conversion).
* **POR‑5 (Boundary compatibility).** For physical wholes, the whole’s boundary encloses the union of its portions; cross‑boundary “leaks” are interactions, not portions.

**Didactic tests.**
✔ “5 kg from a 20 kg billet” — PortionOf.
✔ “Pages 1–10 of the report” — PortionOf (μ = page or token count).
✘ “The pump module of the plant” — **ComponentOf**, not PortionOf.
✘ “The Methods section of the paper” — **ConstituentOf**, not PortionOf.


##### 5.2 PhaseOf — temporal part of the same carrier

**Intent.** Capture “the same holon during a sub‑interval”, preserving identity through change.

**Applicability.** Any `U.Holon` that persists across time with a recognised **carrier identity**.

**Primitive.** `PhaseOf(x, y)` means: *x is y restricted to a proper time interval*.

**Axioms (A14‑PHA‑\*)**

* **PHA‑1 (Partial order).** PhaseOf is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive (on the same carrier).
* **PHA‑2 (Coverage).** The whole is the union of its maximal, non‑overlapping phases over its lifetime interval.
* **PHA‑3 (No paradoxical overlap).** Phases of the **same carrier** do not overlap in time; overlapping variants require `PhaseOf` on *aspects* or different carriers.
* **PHA‑4 (Identity through change).** Properties may vary between phases, but the carrier’s identity criteria hold continuously (e.g., same serial number, same legal identity, same theorem statement).
* **PHA‑5 (Escalation to MHT).** If identity criteria break (e.g., metamorphosis with new objectives), **declare a Meta‑Holon Transition (B.2)** rather than a PhaseOf.

**Didactic tests.**
✔ “PumpUnit#3 **before** calibration” — PhaseOf(Pump#3\_pre, Pump#3).
✔ “Spec v2” — PhaseOf(Spec\_v2, Spec), on the **MethodDescription** artefact.
✔ “Shift 1 of the same batch run” — PhaseOf(Work\_shift1, Work).
✘ “Prototype vs. production unit” — likely **different carriers**; use ComponentOf/ConstituentOf or MHT per criteria.

##### 5.3 CT2R‑LOG & Compose‑CAL handshake *(normative link)*

* **Structural claims** published on the Working-Model surface **SHALL** be justified, when assurance is required, by a **Constructive** grounding narrative using **Γ_m.sum | Γ_m.set | Γ_m.slice** and **linked with `tv:groundedBy`** (see **B.3.5**; **C.13**).  
* **PhaseOf** is **temporal parthood**; it **SHALL NOT** be grounded via Γ\_m. Its assurance follows identity‑through‑time criteria (CC‑PHA‑1..3) and Γ\_time ordering (B.1.4).  
* **MemberOf** remains **non‑mereological** (CC‑MEM‑2). When modelling a collection‑as‑whole for assurance purposes, the constructive basis is **Γ\_m.set**; no **ComponentOf** inferences follow from **MemberOf**.

| “This *item belongs to that collection/collective*.”         | **MemberOf**         | Not a building block of the whole; composition handled in **B.1.7 Γ\_collective**. |
| “This system *plays a Role or position*.”          | **playsRole** (A.15) | Roles are contextual masks, never parts.                                           |

> **Firewall reminder.** If your sentence contains “role”, “policy”, “process/workflow/SOP/script”, you are likely talking about **A.15** (roles/recipes/runs), **not** A.14.

| **CC‑POR‑4 (Boundary)**            | For physical systems, the whole’s boundary encloses the union of portions; cross‑boundary flows are **not** portions.                                                     | Distinguishes stock vs flow.            |
| **CC‑POR‑5 (Non‑replacement)**     | “Replacing 20% of y by v” **MUST** be modelled as **PortionOf** removal + **Component/Constituent** insertion, not as a single PortionOf rewrite.                         | Avoids silent identity change.          |

##### **8.3 PhaseOf guards**

| ID                                    | Requirement                                                                                                                                                      | Purpose                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑PHA‑1 (Carrier identity)**       | `PhaseOf(x,y)` requires an explicit **identity criterion** for y valid over the union of phases (e.g., serial number, legal identity, theorem statement).        | Prevents re‑identification by stealth. |
| **CC‑PHA‑2 (Coverage & non‑overlap)** | The lifetime of y equals the union of its maximal, non‑overlapping phases (on the same aspect).                                                                  | Enables Γ\_time composition and audit. |
| **CC‑PHA‑3 (Aspect clarity)**         | If two temporal slices of y overlap, they **MUST** be phases of **different aspects** (e.g., mechanical‑state vs software‑state), or else be different carriers. | Avoids paradoxical overlaps.           |
| **CC‑PHA‑4 (Escalation)**             | If identity criteria fail during change, declare a **Meta‑Holon Transition** (B.2) instead of PhaseOf.                                                           | Makes re‑identification explicit.      |
| **CC‑PHA‑5 (MethodDescription & Work)**      | Versions of **MethodDescription** and slices of **Work** **SHALL** use `PhaseOf` (A.15); PhaseOf never applies to `U.Role`.                                             | Aligns with A.15 bindings.             |

##### **8.4 Anchoring & validation (normative)**

| ID              | Requirement                                                                                                      | Purpose                                           |
| ----------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑ANCH‑1**   | Every `ut:StructPartOf` edge **MUST** carry a `tv:groundedBy` link to a valid `Γ_m` constructor trace (Compose‑CAL). | Makes A.10 executable; ensures extensional identity. |
| **CC-ANCH-2**   | For **epistemic** edges (`ut:EpiPartOf` and its sub-types), `tv:groundedBy` is **OPTIONAL**; instead supply **`ev:evidence`** and set **`validationMode ∈ {axiomatic, postulate, inferential}`**. | Harmonises evidence treatment for epistemic edges. |
| **CC‑ANCH‑3**   | The public query contract remains `?x ut:PartOf+ ?y`; internally it is realised via CT2R‑aliases grounded by `Γ_m` traces. | Preserves the “one query” UX while tightening semantics. |

*Note.* Property names and trace semantics are defined in the CT2R‑LOG / Compose‑CAL architheories.

##### **8.5 MemberOf minimal semantics (non‑mereological)**

| ID           | Requirement                                                                                       | Purpose                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑MEM‑1** | `MemberOf` domain/range are open: any `U.Holon` may be a member of a collection/collective holon. | Allows mixed collections when needed. |
| **CC‑MEM‑2** | From `MemberOf(x,C)` it is **forbidden** to infer any property of C to x via parthood rules.      | Prevents “set‑as‑whole” errors.       |
| **CC‑MEM‑3** | **Constructive aggregation of collections** is provided by **C.13 Compose‑CAL** (`Γ_m.set`); **agency of collectives** is specified outside A.14 (see **A.15 Role–Method–Work**). | Keeps A.14 narrow and clean.          |


##### **8.5 CT2R‑LOG handshake (Working‑Model → Assurance)**

| ID                 | Requirement                                                                                                                                                              | Purpose                                                                                 |

| **CC-A14-10**      | For **structural** edges on the Working-Model surface, authors **SHALL** set `validationMode=axiomatic` and attach **`tv:groundedBy → Γ_m.sum|set|slice`**.      | Aligns A.14 with CT2R-LOG (**B.3.5**) and Compose-CAL (**C.13**); ensures extensional identity. |
| **CC‑A14‑11**      | **PhaseOf** edges **SHALL NOT** use Γ\_m for grounding. Authors **SHALL** provide identity criteria and non‑overlap per **CC‑PHA‑1..3** and reference **Γ\_time** when ordering matters. | Keeps temporal parthood distinct from construction; preserves the plane firewall.       |

#### 9 · Validation patterns (author’s decision procedure)

**Step 0 — Firewall check.**
If your sentence contains *role*, *policy*, *process/workflow/SOP/script*, or *execution/run/job*, you are **not** in mereology; go to **A.15** (Role–Method–Work).

**Step 1 — Is it measured stuff?**
If yes, pick **PortionOf**. Confirm μ is declared (CC‑POR‑1/2). Test additivity on a toy split (CC‑POR‑3). If flows cross a boundary, remodel as interactions, not portions (CC‑POR‑4).

**Step 2 — Is it a discrete inside part?**
If yes, pick **ComponentOf** (physical) or **ConstituentOf** (conceptual). Do **not** use PortionOf here.

**Step 3 — Is it the same carrier at a time slice?**
If yes, pick **PhaseOf**. Verify identity criteria and non‑overlap (CC‑PHA‑1/2/3). If criteria break, escalate to **B.2** (CC‑PHA‑4).

**Step 4 — Is it a membership statement?**
Use **MemberOf** only; avoid any part‑inferences (CC‑MEM‑2). If you need a **collection as a whole**, use **C.13** (`Γ_m.set`) for constructive grounding. If you need **collective action**, defer to **A.15**.

**Quick spot‑tests (repair kit).**

| Smell                          | Likely error                      | Fix                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “20% of the chassis”           | Treating structure as stuff       | Use **ComponentOf**; if truly laminar material, PortionOf applies to **material stock**, not the assembled chassis.          |
| “Chapter 2 is 15% of the book” | Mixing measures and constituents  | Use **ConstituentOf**; the 15% is **length‑of‑text** as a separate statement.                                                |
| “Spec v2 overlaps v1”          | Overlapping phases on same aspect | Use `PhaseOf(Spec_v2, Spec)` with non‑overlap; represent drafting as **Work** episodes (A.15) rather than overlapping specs. |
| “Team is part of the project”  | Member vs part confusion          | Use **MemberOf(Team, ProjectCollective)**, not partOf.                                                                       |

#### 10 · Interplay with Γ‑flavours (how these relations behave under aggregation)

| Γ‑flavour                    | Mereological hooks (what A.14 supplies)                                                                                                                | Key effect                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Γ\_sys (B.1.2)**          | Treat **PortionOf** as Σ‑additive stocks; **ComponentOf** must respect boundary integration; **PhaseOf** is not aggregated here.                       | Conserves extensive measures and keeps structural WLNK (weakest‑link) on components.          |
| **Γ\_epist (B.1.3)**         | **PortionOf** of texts/data uses μ = token/byte count; **ConstituentOf** composes arguments/sections; **PhaseOf** versions MethodDescriptions/documents.      | Preserves provenance and avoids trust inflation by keeping constituents vs portions distinct. |
| **Γ\_ctx / Γ\_time (B.1.4)** | **PhaseOf** provides the legal slicing for time and order; **PortionOf** is orthogonal (quantities inside steps).                                      | Ensures chronological consistency and monotone coverage.                                      |
| **Γ\_method (B.1.5)**          | Recipes are **MethodDescription** graphs (not parthood). When a recipe refers to stuff‑like inputs, those are **PortionOf** statements on resources.          | Separates recipe composition from structure.                                                  |
| **Γ\_work (B.1.6)**          | Only **Work** carries resource deltas; when logging “consumed 5 kg from Tank A”, model it as **PortionOf** relation to the stock prior to consumption. | Makes Σ‑balance explicit; aligns with CC‑POR‑3/4.                                             |

#### 11 · Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Predictable composition.** Σ‑additivity for portions and identity‑through‑time for phases make Γ‑proofs straightforward.
* **History without confusion.** Temporal slicing is explicit and audit‑ready; no paradoxical overlaps.
* **Cleaner integration with roles and recipes.** The firewall prevents “functional object” creep into structure.
* **Compatibility with engineering practice.** Mirrors *product breakdown* (components) vs *functional breakdown* (roles) vs *material stocks* (portions) vs *versioning* (phases).

**Trade‑offs / mitigations**

* **Modelling energy.** Authors must pick μ and declare units; provide a short μ‑catalog per project.
* **More relation names.** Two extra sub‑relations increase vocabulary; mitigated by the decision table (§ 6) and spot‑tests (§ 9).
* **Escalation discipline.** Deciding PhaseOf vs MHT requires judgement; A.14 provides criteria, and B.2 captures true re‑identification.

#### 12 · Pedagogy aids (non‑normative)

**Two‑minute checklist for reviewers**

1. Do I see “process/workflow/policy/script”? — then **A.15**, not mereology.
2. Does every PortionOf have a declared μ and unit?
3. Do phases cover a lifetime without overlap for the same aspect?
4. Are any roles/recipes appearing as parts? If yes, stop and refactor.

#### 13 · Patch map (where to touch in the working file)

1. **Kernel · Holonic Mereology (§ A.1 → A.14)**
   *Add* sub‑sections “PortionOf” and “PhaseOf” with axioms (POR‑1..5, PHA‑1..5).
   *Move* MemberOf note to a minimal semantics paragraph (no composition here).

2. **A.15 (Role–Method–Work)**
   *Cross‑link* firewall (CC‑A14‑0/0b) and reinforce that versioning uses **PhaseOf** only on MethodDescription/Work.

3. **B.1.2 Γ\_sys / B.1.3 Γ\_epist / B.1.4 Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time / B.1.5 Γ\_method / B.1.6 Γ\_work**
   *Insert* a one‑line “A.14 compliance” note: which A.14 sub‑relations each flavour relies on, as in § 10.

4. **Examples & Annexes**
   *Refactor* any “percentage as part” examples into PortionOf with declared μ;
   *Split* any overlapping histories into PhaseOf sequences.

Each edited heading should carry the badge **“► decided‑by: A.14 Advanced Mereology”**.

#### 14 · Rationale (state‑of‑the‑art alignment, post‑2015)

* **Metrical mereology** advances (e.g., recent work on quantity‑based parthood and additivity) motivate **PortionOf** with explicit μ and Σ‑laws, preventing the classic “stuff as components” fallacy.
* **Temporal parts & identity through change** (renewed treatments in analytic metaphysics and formal ontology) motivate **PhaseOf** with coverage/non‑overlap and escalation when identity criteria fail.
* **Engineering ontologies (BORO lineage, Core Constructional practice, ISO 15926 family)** keep a strict separation between **functional breakdowns** (our Roles) and **product breakdowns** (our Components), with **stock/consumable** modelling (our Portions) handled by quantities, not by component trees.
* **Knowledge artefact lifecycles** in contemporary MBSE and open‑science workflows use explicit versioning (our PhaseOf) and provenance‑preserving composition (our ConstituentOf).
* The net effect is a **minimal‑sufficient** catalogue: two added sub‑relations close real modelling gaps while preserving **parsimony**, **didactic clarity**, and **Γ‑compatibility** across domains.

### A.15 Role–Method–Work Alignment (Contextual Enactment)  \[A]

#### 1 · Intent & Context

In any complex system, from a software project to a biological cell, there is a fundamental distinction between **what something is** (its structure), **what it is supposed to do** (its role and specified capability), and **what it actually does** (its work). Confusing these layers is a primary source of design flaws, budget overruns, and failed projects. Teams argue about a "process" without clarifying if they mean the documented procedure, the team's ability to execute it, or a specific execution that happened last Tuesday.

This pattern provides the canonical alignment for modeling contextual enactment in FPF, serving as the ultimate implementation of the **Strict Distinction Principle (A.7)**. It weaves together several foundational concepts into a single, coherent model of how intention becomes action:
*   **A.2 (Contextual Role Assignment):** Provides the `Holder#Role:Context` structure for assigning roles.
*   **A.4 (Temporal Duality):** Provides the strict separation between `design-time` and `run-time`.
*   **A.12 (External Transformer):** Ensures that all actions are attributed to an external agent.

The intent of this pattern is to establish a normative, unambiguous vocabulary and set of relations for describing the entire evolution of an action, from the specification of a capability to its concrete, resource-consuming execution.

To keep plan–run separation explicit, this pattern references **A.15.2 `U.WorkPlan`** for **schedules/calendars** and **A.15.1 `U.Work`** for **dated execution**. Ambiguous terms like “process / workflow / schedule” are constrained by **L‑PROC / L‑FUNC / L‑SCHED** (E‑cluster): a _workflow_ is a **Method/MethodDescription**, a _schedule_ is a **WorkPlan**, and what _happened_ is **Work**.

**Terminology note (L‑ACT).** The words _action/activity_ are **not normative** in the kernel. When a generic “doing” is needed, we use the didactic term **enactment** (not a type). Normative references must be to **`U.Method` / `U.MethodDescription` / `U.Work` / `U.WorkPlan`**. See lexical rules **L‑PROC / L‑FUNC / L‑SCHED / L‑ACT**

#### 2 · Problem

Without this formal framework, models suffer from a cascade of category errors:

1.  **Role-as-Part:** A Role (e.g., `AuditorRole`) is incorrectly placed inside a structural bill-of-materials (`ComponentOf`), making the system's architecture brittle and nonsensical.
2.  **Specification-as-Execution:** A `MethodDescription` (the "recipe") is treated as evidence that the work was done. This leads to "paper compliance," where a system is considered complete simply because its documentation exists.
3.  **Capability-as-Work:** A team's *ability* to perform a task (`Capability`) is conflated with the *actual performance* of that task (`Work`). This obscures the reality of resource consumption and actual outcomes.
4.  **Work-without-Context:** An instance of work is logged without a clear link back to the role, capability, and specification that governed it, making the work unauditable and its results impossible to reproduce.
5.  **Ambiguous "Process/Activity":** The overloaded term "process" is used indiscriminately to refer to all of the above, creating a fog of miscommunication that paralyzes decision-making. Activity/action terms must be resolved via L‑ACT to Method/MethodDescription (recipe), WorkPlan (schedule), or Work (run).

#### 3 · Forces

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Structure vs. Function** | The need to model the stable, physical structure of a system (`mereology`) vs. the need to model its dynamic, functional behavior (`roles` and `actions`). |
| **Design vs. Run** | The need for a timeless, reusable description of a capability (`design-time`) vs. the need for a specific, dated record of its execution (`run-time`). |
| **Clarity vs. Jargon** | The need for a precise, formal vocabulary to prevent ambiguity vs. the reality that teams use informal, domain-specific jargon like "process" or "workflow." |
| **Accountability vs. Complexity** | The need for a complete, end-to-end audit trail for every action vs. the desire to keep models simple and avoid excessive documentation. |

#### 4 · Solution
The solution is a stratified alignment that cleanly separates the `design-time` and `run-time` for contextual **enactment**. The bridge between these worlds is the **`U.RoleAssignment`**.

#### 4.1 The Core Entities: A Strict Distinction

FPF mandates the use of the following distinct, non-overlapping entities to model action. Using them interchangeably is a conformance violation.

**A) Design-Time Entities (The World of Potential):**

*   **`U.Role`:** A contextual "mask" or "job title" (e.g., `TesterRole`). It specifies a function but is not the function itself.
*  **`U.Method`:** The **abstract way‑of‑doing** inside a context (paradigm‑agnostic; may be imperative, functional, logical, or hybrid).
*  **`U.MethodDescription`:** A **`U.Episteme` describing a `U.Method`** (the SOP/algorithm/proof/recipe on a carrier).
*   **`U.Capability`:** An **attribute** of a `U.System` that represents its **ability** to perform the actions described in a `MethodDescription`. This is the "skill" or "know-how."
* **`U.WorkPlan`:** An **`U.Episteme`** declaring **intended `U.Work` occurrences** (windows, dependencies, intended performers as role kinds, budgets) — see **A.15.2**.
* 
**B) The Bridge Entity:**
*   **`U.RoleAssignment`:** The formal assertion `Holder#Role:Context` that links a specific `U.Holon` to a `U.Role` within a `U.BoundedContext`. This binding is what "activates" the requirements associated with a role.

**C) Run-Time Entity (The World of Actuality):**

*   **`U.Work`:** An **occurrence** or **event**. It is the concrete, dated, resource-consuming **execution of a `U.MethodDescription`** by a `Holder` acting under a `U.RoleAssignment`; capability checks are evaluated at run time against the holder. This is the only entity that has a start and end time and consumes resources.

**Kinds of Work and the primary target**
Every `U.Work` SHALL declare a `primaryTarget: U.Holon` and a `kind`.
Kinds:
* Operational — transforms a `U.System` or its environment.
* Communicative (SpeechAct) — transforms a deontic/organizational frame (e.g., commitments, permissions, approvals).
* Epistemic — transforms a `U.Episteme` (e.g., curating a dataset).
The `primaryTarget` disambiguates enactment: what is being acted upon. Example: an approval is `kind=Communicative`, `primaryTarget = Commitment(change=4711)`. A deployment is `kind=Operational`, `primaryTarget = ServiceInstance(prod-us-eu-1)`.

**Didactic Note for Managers: The "Chef" Analogy**

This model can be easily understood using the analogy of a chef in a restaurant.

*   **`ChefRole`** is the **Role**. It's a job title with certain expectations.
*   A **Cookbook (`U.MethodDescription`)** contains the **recipe** for a Soufflé. It's a piece of knowledge.
*   The chef's **skill** in making soufflés is their **`U.Capability`**. They have this skill even when they are not cooking.
*   The restaurant's rulebook (`U.BoundedContext`) states that anyone in the `ChefRole` *must* have the `Capability` to follow the recipes in the cookbook.
*   The actual act of **making a soufflé** on Tuesday evening—using eggs and butter, taking 25 minutes, and consuming gas—is the **`U.Work`**.

Confusing these is like mistaking the cookbook for the soufflé. FPF's framework simply makes these common-sense distinctions formal and mandatory.

#### 4.2 The Canonical Relations: Connecting the Layers

The entities are connected by a set of precise, normative relations that form an unbreakable causal chain. The following diagram illustrates this flow from the abstract context down to the concrete execution.

    style W fill:#ffe6cc,stroke:#d79b00,stroke-width:2px,font-weight:bold
```

*   **`bindsCapability(Role, Capability)`:** A `U.BoundedContext` asserts that a given `Role` requires a specific `Capability`. This is a `design-time` rule.
*  **`isDescribedBy(Method, MethodDescription)`:** A `Capability` is formally described by one or more `MethodDescription`s. This links the skill to the recipe.
*   **`isExecutionOf(Work, MethodDescription)`:** A specific `U.Work` is a `run-time` instance of a `design-time` `Capability`.
*   **`performedBy(Work, RoleAssigning)`:** A `U.Work` is always performed by a specific `Agent` (a RoleAssignment). This links the action to the actor-in-context.

_At run time, capability thresholds declared by the context/spec are **checked** against the holder; Work outcomes provide **evidence** for capability conformance._

This chain provides complete traceability: a specific instance of `Work` can be traced back through its `Capability` to its `MethodDescription`, and to the `Agent` (`Holder` + `Role` + `Context`) that was authorized and responsible for its execution.

#### 5 · Archetypal Grounding

The Contextual Action Framework is universal. It applies identically to the modeling of physical engineering processes, knowledge work, and socio-technical systems.

**Key takeaway from grounding:**
This side-by-side comparison reveals the power of the framework. A seemingly different activity like welding a car chassis and reviewing a scientific paper are shown to have the **exact same underlying causal structure**. Both involve a `Holder` (a system) acting in a `Role` within a `Context`, using a `Capability` described by a `MethodDescription` to produce a specific, auditable instance of `Work`. This universality is what allows FPF to bridge disparate domains.

#### 6 · Conformance Checklist

To ensure the integrity of action modeling, all FPF-compliant models must adhere to the following normative checks.

| ID | Requirement (Normative Predicate) | Purpose / Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CC-A15-1 (Entity Distinction)** | The entities `U.Role`, **`U.Method`**, **`U.MethodDescription`**, `U.Capability`, **`U.WorkPlan`**, and `U.Work` **MUST** be modeled as distinct, non‑overlapping types. | This is the core enforcement of **Strict Distinction (A.7)**. It prevents the category errors outlined in the "Problem" section. |
| **CC-A15-2 (Temporal Scope)** | `U.Method`/`U.MethodDescription`/`U.WorkPlan` exist in **design‑time**; `U.Work` exists in **run‑time**. Design artifacts are not mutated by operational events. | Enforces **Temporal Duality (A.4)**. Blueprints cannot be mutated by operational events. |
| **CC-A15-3 (RoleAssignment Mandate)**| Every `U.Work` **MUST** be linked via `performedBy` to a valid `U.RoleAssignment`. | Guarantees that every action has a clearly identified, context-bound actor, ensuring accountability. |
| **CC-A15-4 (Traceability Chain)**| For every `U.Work`, an unbroken chain **MUST** exist: `Work —performedBy→ RoleAssigning` and `Work —isExecutionOf→ MethodDescription —describes→ Method`. Capability checks are evaluated against the holder at run time. | Ensures end-to-end auditability from a specific action back to the "recipe" that governed it. |
| **CC-A15-5 (No Roles in Mereology)** | A `U.Role` or `U.Capability` **SHALL NOT** be part of a mereological (`partOf`) hierarchy. | The "Role-as-Part" anti-pattern is a violation. Roles and capabilities are functional, not structural. Enforces **A.14**. |
| **CC-A15-6 (Resource Honesty)** | Resource consumption (`U.Resource`) **MUST** only be associated with `U.Work`, never with `U.MethodDescription` or `U.Capability`. | Enforces that costs are tied to actual events, not to plans or potential. Aligns with **Resrc-CAL (C.5)**. |
| **CC‑A15‑7 (Plan/Run Split)** | Schedules/calendars **MUST** be represented as `U.WorkPlan` (A.15.2). A WorkPlan SHALL NOT be used as evidence of execution; only `U.Work` carries actuals. | |
| **CC‑A15‑8 (Lexical Sanity)** | Unqualified “process/workflow/schedule” **MUST** be interpreted per **L‑PROC/L‑FUNC/L‑SCHED**: workflow ⇒ `Method/MethodDescription`; schedule ⇒ `WorkPlan`; what happened ⇒ `Work`. | |
| **CC-A15-9 (Realisation)** | A valid `U.Work` realises a `U.MethodDescription` under a `U.RoleAssignment`. Spontaneous physical evolution without a MethodDescription is modeled as `U.Dynamics`, not as `U.Work`. | |
| **CC-A15-10 (GateSplit)** | A SpeechAct that changes a Role’s state (e.g., “Approve”, “Authorize”) MUST be modeled as a distinct `U.Work` step (kind=Communicative). It may open the Green‑Gate for a subsequent operational step, but it SHALL NOT be conflated with that step. | |
| **CC-A15-11 (KindFit)** The `U.Role` named in the `performedBy` assignment SHALL be appropriate for the Work kind (e.g., ApproverRole for Communicative approvals; DeployerRole for Operational deployments). | |

#### 7 · Consequences

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Unambiguous Communication:** Provides a shared, precise vocabulary for teams to discuss roles, processes, and results, eliminating the ambiguity of terms like "process." | **Initial Learning Curve:** Requires teams to learn and internalize the distinctions between the core entities. *Mitigation:* The "Chef" analogy and clear archetypes serve as powerful didactic tools. FPF tooling should guide users with templates. |
| **End-to-End Auditability:** The framework creates a "digital thread" that links every operational event (`Work`) back to its authorizing role, context, and specification. This is critical for regulated industries and for root cause analysis. | **Increased Formality:** Requires more explicit modeling than informal approaches. *Mitigation:* This is a strategic investment. The upfront cost of formal modeling is offset by massive savings in debugging, re-work, and compliance efforts later. |
| **Enables True Modularity:** By separating capability from execution, the framework allows for easier substitution. A `MethodDescription` can be updated without invalidating past `Work` records. A `Holder` can be replaced with another, as long as it possesses the same `Capability`. | - |
| **Foundation for Governance:** The model makes it possible to build powerful governance rules. For example: "Only an `Agent` with `AuditorRole` can execute `Work` that instantiates the `ApproveRelease` capability." | - |

#### 8 · Rationale

This pattern solves a problem that has plagued systems modeling for decades: the conflation of what a system *is* with what it *does*. Its rigor is not arbitrary but is grounded in several key intellectual traditions.

*   **Ontology Engineering:** The pattern is a direct application of best practices from foundational ontologies (like UFO), which have long insisted on the distinction between *endurants* (objects like a `U.System`) and *perdurants* (events/processes like `U.Work`), and between intrinsic properties and relational roles. FPF makes these powerful distinctions accessible to practicing engineers.
*   **Process Theory:** Formalisms like the Pi-calculus or Petri Nets model processes as dynamic interactions. The FPF Contextual Action Framework provides a higher-level, more semantically rich layer on top of such formalisms. The `U.Work` entity can be seen as an instance of a process, but FPF adds the crucial context of the `Role`, `Capability`, and `MethodDescription` that govern it.
*   **Pragmatism and Practice:** The framework is deeply pragmatic. The distinctions it makes (e.g., between a `MethodDescription` and `Work`) are precisely the ones that matter in the real world of project management, compliance, and debugging. When a failure occurs, a manager needs to know: was the recipe wrong (`MethodDescription`), did the chef lack the skill (`Capability`), or did they just make a mistake this one time (`Work`)? This framework provides the vocabulary to ask and answer that question precisely.

By creating this clean, stratified alignment for enactment, FPF provides a stable and scalable foundation for all of its more advanced architheories, from resource management (`Resrc-CAL`) and decision theory (`Decsn-CAL`) to ethics (`Norm-CAL`).

#### 9 · Relations

*   **Directly Implements:** `A.7 Strict Distinction`.
*   **Builds Upon:** `A.2 (U.Role)`, `A.2.1 (U.RoleAssignment)`, `A.4 (Temporal Duality)`, `A.12 (External Transformer)`.
*   **Is Used By / Provides Foundation For:**
    *   `C.4 Method-CAL`: Provides the formal definition of `U.MethodDescription` and the `Γ_method` operator for composing them.
    *   `C.5 Resrc-CAL`: Provides the `U.Work` entity to which resource consumption is attached.
    *   `B.1.6 Γ_work`: The aggregation operator for `U.Work`.
    *   `B.4 Canonical Evolution Loop`: The entire loop is a sequence of `Work` instances that modify `MethodDescription`s.
    *   `A.15.2 U.WorkPlan`: plan–run split, baselines and variance against `U.Work`.
* **Constrains:** Any architheory that models actions or processes must use this framework to be conformant. It serves as the canonical alignment for **contextual enactment** in the FPF ecosystem.
* **Coordinates with** L‑PROC / L‑FUNC / L‑SCHED (E‑cluster) for lexical disambiguation of _process / workflow / schedule_.

# A.15.1 — U.Work  \[D]

## 1 · Context (plain‑language motivation)

After we have agreed **who is assigned** (via **Role assignment**), **what they can do** (via **Capability**), and **how in principle** it should be done (via **Method/MethodDescription**), we still need a precise concept for **what actually happened** in real time and space.

That concept is **`U.Work`**: the **dated run‑time occurrence** of enacting a MethodDescription by a specific performer under a Role assignment, with concrete parameter bindings, resource consumption, and outcomes. Managers care about Work because it is the **only place** where cost, time, defects, and evidence are **real**. Architects care because Work ties plans and specs to accountable execution.

---

## 2 · Problem (what breaks without a clean notion of Work)

1. **Plan/run confusion.** Schedules and diagrams get mistaken for “the process,” so audits and KPIs become fiction.
2. **Spec/run conflation.** A method description (code/SOP) is reported as if it were an execution; conversely, logs are treated as recipes.
3. **Who/when leakage.** People and calendars are baked into specs; reuse and staffing agility collapse.
4. **Resource dishonesty.** Energy/money/tool wear are booked to methods or roles, not to actual runs; costing and sustainability metrics drift.
5. **Mereology muddle.** Teams hand‑wave over “sub‑runs,” retries, overlaps, or long‑running episodes; roll‑ups double‑count or miss work.

## 3 · Forces (what the definition must balance)

| Force                              | Tension we resolve                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs. domain detail** | One Work notion for surgery, welding, ETL, proofs, lab cycles—while letting each keep its vocabulary. |
| **Granularity vs. aggregation**    | Atomic runs vs. composite operations; we need roll‑up without double‑count.                           |
| **Concurrency vs. order**          | Parallel/overlapped activities need clear part/overlap semantics.                                     |
| **Identity vs. retries**           | A failed attempt, a retry, and a resumed episode—what is “the same” work?                             |
| **Time realism vs. simplicity**    | We need intervals and coverage but cannot bury users in temporal logic notation.                      |

## 4 · Solution — define `U.Work` as the accountable, dated occurrence

### 4.1 Definition

**`U.Work`** is a **4D occurrence holon**: a **dated run‑time enactment** of a `U.MethodDescription` by a performer designated through a `U.RoleAssignment`, within a `U.BoundedContext`, that binds concrete parameters, consumes/produces resources, and leaves an auditable trace.

> **Memory aid:** *Work = “how it went this time”* (dated, resourced, accountable).

### 4.2 Core anchors (conceptual descriptors; not a data schema)

When you describe a Work instance in a review, answer these prompts:

1. **Window** — start/end timestamps (and, where relevant, location/asset).
2. **Spec** — `isExecutionOf → U.MethodDescription` (the description actually followed).
3. **Performer** — `performedBy → U.RoleAssignment` (which **holder#role\:context** acted).
4. **Parameters** — concrete values bound for this run (from the Method/MethodDescription parameter declarations).
5. **Inputs/Outputs** — material/information artifacts read/written, products/services delivered.
6. **Resources** — energy, materials, machine time, money (the **only** place we book them).
7. **Outcome** — success/failure classes, quality measures, acceptance verdicts (per Method/Spec criteria).
8. **Links** — predecessor/successor/overlap relations to other Work, and step/run nesting (if part of a bigger operation).
9. **Context** — the bounded context(s) under which this run is judged (normally inherited from the MethodDescription and RoleAssigning; see A.15 for cross‑checks).

### 4.3 Clear distinctions (the four‑slot grammar in action)

| You are pointing at…                          | The right FPF concept  | Litmus                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The **recipe/code/diagram**                   | **MethodDescription**         | Is it knowledge on a carrier?                                   |
| The **semantic “way of doing”**               | **Method**             | Same contract across notations?                                 |
| The **assignment** (“who is being what”)     | **Role → RoleAssigning** | Can be reassigned without changing the system?                  |
| The **ability** (“can do within bounds”)      | **Capability**         | Would remain even if not assigned?                             |
| The **dated occurrence** with logs, resources | **Work**               | Did it happen at (t₀, t₁), consume resources, produce outcomes? |

## 5 · Work mereology (how runs form holarchies)

We adopt a **4D extensional** stance for occurrences: a Work is identified primarily by its **spatiotemporal extent** and its execution anchors (spec used, performer, parameterization). This avoids double‑counting and keeps aggregation sound. FPF adapts insights from BORO/constructive ontologies to Work while staying practical.

### 5.1 Parts and wholes of Work (design‑neutral, run‑time facts)

* **Temporal‑part (`TemporalPartOf_work`).** A proper **time‑slice** of a Work (e.g., the first 10 minutes of a 2‑hour run). Useful for monitoring and SLAs.
* **Episode‑part (`EpisodeOf_work`).** A **resumption fragment** after an interruption (same run identity if policy deems it one episode; see 5.5).
* **Operational‑part (`OperationalPartOf_work`).** A **sub‑run** that enacts a **factor** of the Method/Spec (e.g., “incision” run within “appendectomy” run), possibly **overlapping** with others in time.
* **Parallel‑part (`ConcurrentPartOf_work`).** Two sub‑runs that **overlap** in their windows, coordinated by the same higher‑level run.

**Didactic rule:** **Method composition ≠ proof of Work decomposition.** Sub‑runs often map to method factors, but retries, batching, pipelining, and failures make the mapping non‑isomorphic.

### 5.2 Key relations among Work

* **`precedes/happensBefore`** — strict partial order on Work windows.
* **`overlaps`** — intervals intersect but neither contains the other.
* **`contains/within`** — one Work’s window contains another’s.
* **`causedBy/causes`** — pragmatic causal links (e.g., a rework caused by a failed inspection run).
* **`retryOf`** — a new Work instance re‑attempting the same MethodDescription with revised parameters.
* **`resumptionOf`** — a Work episode that **continues** an interrupted run (policy decides identity; see 5.5).

These relations are **run‑time facts**, not design assumptions.

### 5.3 Operators for roll‑ups (Γ\_time and Γ\_work)

* **Temporal coverage — `Γ_time(S)`**
  For a set `S` of Work parts, returns a **coverage interval set** (union of intervals) or, when required, the **convex hull** `[min t₀, max t₁]`. Use **union** for utilization; use **hull** for lead time.
  *Properties:* idempotent, commutative, monotone under set inclusion.

* **Resource aggregation — `Γ_work(S)`**
  For a set `S` of Work parts, returns the **aggregated resource ledger** (materials, energy, time, money) with de‑duplication rules for shared/overlapped parts (context‑declared).
  *Properties:* additive on **disjoint** parts; requires **overlap policy** otherwise (e.g., attribute costs to the parent once, not to each child).

**Manager’s tip:** Pick the coverage operator that matches your KPI: **union** for machine utilization; **hull** for calendar elapsed; never mix silently.

### 5.4 Identity of a Work (extensional criterion, pragmatically framed)

Two Work records refer to the **same Work** iff, in the relevant context:

* their **time–space extent** is the same (within declared tolerance),
* they link to the **same `MethodDescription`**,
* they have the **same performer** (`U.RoleAssignment`), and
* they bind the **same parameters** (or declared‑equivalent values).

If any of these differ (or the context declares equivalence absent), they are **distinct** Work instances (e.g., a retry).

### 5.5 Interruptions, retries, resumptions (episode policy)

* **Retry:** **new Work** with its own window and parameters; link via `retryOf`.
* **Resumption:** **same Work identity** split into **episodes** if the context’s **episode policy** declares so (e.g., “power loss under 5 minutes keeps identity”).
* **Rework:** **new Work** caused by a failure in earlier Work; link via `causedBy`.

**Why it matters:** plans, costs, and quality stats depend on whether you treat a disruption as **one episode** or **a new run**. Declare the policy **in the bounded context**.

---

## 6 · Archetypal grounding (parallel domains)

### 6.1 Surgical case (overlap and episodes)

* **Top run:** `Appendectomy_Case#2025‑08‑10T09:05–11:42`.
* **Spec:** `Appendectomy_v5` (MethodDescription).
* **Performer:** `OR_Team_A#SurgicalTeamRole:Hospital_2025` (RoleAssigning).
* **Operational parts:** `Incision` (09:15–09:22), `Exploration` (overlaps with monitoring), `Closure` (11:10–11:35).
* **Episode:** brief power dip 10:02–10:07 → **resumptionOf** same run (per hospital policy).
* **Γ\_time:** union for OR utilization; hull for patient lead time.
* **Γ\_work:** totals consumables and staff time once (no double‑count for overlapping sub‑runs).

### 6.2 ETL pipeline (parallelism and retries)

* **Top run:** `ETL_Nightly_2025‑08‑11T01:00–01:47`.
* **Spec:** `ETL_v12.bpmn`.
* **Performer:** `ETL_Runtime#TransformerRole:DataOps_2025`.
* **Parallel parts:** `Extract_A` ‖ `Extract_B`; `Transform` starts when either completes (overlap).
* **Retry:** `Load` failed at 01:36; retried with batch size ↓ — **new Work** linked via `retryOf`.
* **Γ\_time:** hull for SLA, union for cluster utilization.
* **Γ\_work:** sum compute minutes; attribute storage I/O once at the parent.

### 6.3 Thermodynamic cycle (work as a path)

* **Run:** `Carnot_Cycle_Run#2025‑08‑09T13:00–13:06`.
* **Spec:** `Carnot_Cycle_Spec` (MethodDescription with Dynamics model).
* **Performer:** `LabRig_7#TransformerRole:ThermoLab`.
* **Work identity:** the **path in state‑space** traced during the interval; outputs: heat/work tallies.
* **Γ\_time:** straightforward interval; **Γ\_work:** integrates energy exchange; no “steps” required.

---

## 7 · Bias‑Annotation (as in E‑cluster)

* **Lenses tested:** `Prag`, `Arch`, `Did`, `Epist`.
* **Scope declaration:** Universal; temporal semantics and episode policy are **context‑local** via `U.BoundedContext`.
* **Rationale:** Gives FPF a clean, actionable notion of **occurrence** compatible with `U.RoleAssignment` / **Role Enactment** (A.2.1; A.15) and with 4D extensional thinking, so that costing, quality, and audit rest on **runs**, not on plans or recipes.

## 8 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A15.1‑1 (Strict distinction).**
`U.Work` is a **dated run‑time occurrence**. It is **not** a `U.Method` (semantic way), **not** a `U.MethodDescription` (description), **not** a `U.Role/RoleAssigning` (assignment), and **not** a `U.WorkPlan` (plan/schedule).

**CC‑A15.1‑2 (Required links).**
Every `U.Work` **MUST** reference:
(a) `isExecutionOf → U.MethodDescription` (the spec followed), and
(b) `performedBy → U.RoleAssignment` (the assigned performer in context).

**CC‑A15.1‑3 (Time window).**
Every `U.Work` **MUST** carry a closed interval `[t_start, t_end]` (or an explicitly marked open end for in‑flight work) and, where relevant, location/asset.

**CC‑A15.1‑4 (Context anchoring & judgement).**
A `U.Work` **MUST** be judged inside a declared **`U.BoundedContext`** (the **judgement context**).

* By default, the judgement context is **the context of the referenced MethodDescription**.
* If `performedBy` references a RoleAssigning in a different context, there **MUST** exist an explicit **Bridge (`U.Alignment`)** or policy stating cross‑context acceptance. Otherwise, the Work is **non‑conformant** in that context.

**CC‑A15.1‑5 (RoleAssigning validity).**
The `performedBy` RoleAssigning’s `timespan` **MUST** cover the Work interval. If it does not, the Work is **invalid** or must be re‑judged in a context that allows retroactive assignments.

**CC‑A15.1‑6 (Parameter binding).**
Parameters declared by the Method/MethodDescription **MUST** have concrete values bound **at Work creation/start** and recorded with the Work. Defaults in the spec do not satisfy this requirement.

**CC‑A15.1‑7 (Capability check).**
All capability thresholds stated by the Method/MethodDescription **MUST** be checked against the **holder** in `performedBy` **at the time of execution** (or at defined checkpoints). Violations must be flagged on the Work outcome.

**CC‑A15.1‑8 (Acceptance criteria).**
Success/failure and quality grades **MUST** be determined by the acceptance criteria declared (or referenced) by the Method/MethodDescription **in the judgment context**. The verdict is recorded on the Work.

**CC‑A15.1‑9 (Resource honesty).**
All consumptions and costs (energy, materials, machine‑time, money, tool wear) **SHALL** be booked **only** to `U.Work` (not to Method, MethodDescription, Role, or Capability). Estimates may live in specs; **actuals** live in Work.

**CC‑A15.1‑10 (Mereology declared).**
If a Work has parts, the chosen **part relation(s)** must be declared (temporal‑part, episode‑part, operational‑part, concurrent‑part). Ambiguous mixtures are forbidden.

**CC‑A15.1‑11 (Γ\_time selection).**
For any roll‑up, the judgement context **MUST** declare which temporal coverage operator applies: **union** (utilization) or **convex hull** (lead time). Silent mixing is prohibited.

**CC‑A15.1‑12 (Γ\_work aggregation).**
Aggregation of resource ledgers across Work parts **MUST** specify an **overlap policy** (e.g., “attribute shared machine‑time to parent only”) to prevent double‑counting.

**CC‑A15.1‑13 (Identity & retries).**
A retry **MUST** be modeled as a **new Work** linked via `retryOf`. Interruptions that are treated as the **same run** must be modeled as **episodes** (`resumptionOf`) per a context‑declared **episode policy**.

**CC‑A15.1‑14 (Concurrency & ordering).**
Overlaps and precedences among Work **MUST** use interval relations (`overlaps`, `precedes`, `contains/within`). Implicit “step order” claims are not admissible evidence.

**CC‑A15.1‑15 (Cross‑context evidence).**
If a Work is to be accepted in multiple contexts (e.g., regulatory + operational), either:
(a) re‑judge it in each context, or
(b) provide Bridges that map acceptance criteria/units/roles; never assume cross‑context identity by name.

**CC‑A15.1‑16 (Spec changes during run).**
If the MethodDescription version changes mid‑run, the Work **MUST** either:
(a) split into episodes bound to respective specs, or
(b) record an explicit **spec override** event in the judgement context. Silent substitution is forbidden.

**CC‑A15.1‑17 (Distributed performers).**
If multiple RoleAssignings jointly perform the same top‑level Work (e.g., multi‑agent orchestration), the Work **MUST** either:
(a) designate a **lead RoleAssigning** and list others as **concurrent parts**, or
(b) be modeled as a **parent Work** with child Works per RoleAssigning.

**CC‑A15.1‑18 (Logs ≠ Work by themselves).**
Logs/telemetry are **evidence** for a Work; they **do not constitute** a Work unless bound to (spec, performer, time window) and judged in a context.

---

## 9 · Temporal & Aggregation Semantics (normative operators & invariants)

### 9.1 Temporal coverage `Γ_time`

* **Input:** a finite set `S` of Work instances or Work parts.
* **Output:** either (a) the **union** of their intervals, or (b) the **convex hull** `[min t_start, max t_end]`—**as declared by context** and KPI.
* **Invariants:**

  * **Idempotent:** `Γ_time(S ∪ S) = Γ_time(S)`
  * **Commutative:** order of elements irrelevant
  * **Monotone:** if `S ⊆ T` then coverage(S) ⊆ coverage(T) (for union) or hull(S) ⊆ hull(T) (for hull)
* **Usage guidance:**

  * Use **union** for **utilization/availability** (how much of the clock time the asset was actually busy).
  * Use **hull** for **lead/cycle time** (elapsed from first touch to last release).
  * **Manager’s tip:** Write the choice near the KPI; many disputes are just a hidden union‑vs‑hull mismatch.

### 9.2 Resource aggregation `Γ_work`

* **Input:** a finite set `S` of Work instances or parts with resource ledgers.
* **Output:** an **aggregated ledger** (materials, energy, machine‑time, money, tool wear) with explicit **overlap policy**.
* **Invariants:**

  * **Additivity on disjoint parts:** if intervals/resources are disjoint by policy, totals add.
  * **No double‑count:** overlapping costs must follow the declared policy (e.g., count once at parent).
  * **Traceability:** each aggregated figure must be reconcilable to contributing Work IDs.
* **Typical policies:**

  * **Parent‑attribution:** shared fixed costs at parent; variable costs at children.
  * **Pro‑rata by wall‑time:** split overlaps by relative durations.
  * **Driver‑based:** allocate by a declared driver (e.g., CPU share, weight, priority).

---

## 10 · Cross‑context checks (MethodDescription ↔ RoleAssigning ↔ Work)

When a Work is recorded, perform these **three quick checks**:

1. **Spec–Context Check.** Does `isExecutionOf` refer to a MethodDescription **defined in** the judgement context (or bridged to it)?

   * If **no**, the Work is **out‑of‑context**; either change context or add a Bridge.

1. **RoleAssigning–Context Check.** Is `performedBy`’s RoleAssigning **valid in** the same context (or bridged)?

   * If **no**, the Work is **unassigned** for that context; remedy via a valid RoleAssigning or a policy exception.

3. **Contract–Outcome Check.** Do the Work’s inputs/outputs and metrics satisfy the **acceptance criteria** from the spec **as interpreted in that context**?

   * If **no**, the Work **fails** or is “conditionally accepted” per context policy.

> **Manager’s mnemonic:** Context, assignment, Contract → **CAC**. Fail any → the Work is not acceptable *here* (perhaps acceptable elsewhere).

---

## 11 · Anti‑patterns (and the right move)

* **“The log is the process.”** Dumping telemetry without binding (spec, performer, context) → **Not Work**. Create a Work, link the log as evidence.
* **Silent cross‑context acceptance.** “Ops accepted it, so audit accepts it.” → Add a **Bridge** or re‑judge in audit context.
* **Spec drift in mid‑run.** Swapping SOP v5→v6 without recording → Split into episodes or record override.
* **Budget on the method.** Charging costs to Method or Role → Book **only** to Work; keep estimates in specs.
* **Part ambiguity.** Mixing retries, episodes, and operational parts with no declared relation → Choose and declare the part relation.
* **Union/hull confusion.** Changing KPI coverage silently between reports → Declare `Γ_time` policy per KPI.
* **Double‑count in overlaps.** Summing child and parent resource ledgers → Declare and apply an overlap policy.

## 12 · Migration notes (quick wins)

1. **Backfill links.** For existing logs, create Work records and attach `isExecutionOf` and `performedBy`.
2. **Name the context.** Pick the judgement context explicitly; add Bridges if multiple contexts must accept.
3. **Publish the episode policy.** Decide when an interruption keeps identity vs forces a new run.
4. **Choose Γ\_time per KPI.** Put “union” or “hull” in the KPI definition; stop arguing in meetings.
5. **Set an overlap policy.** Write one sentence on how shared costs are allocated; apply consistently.
6. **Pull plans out.** Move calendars to `U.WorkPlan`; let Work record actuals.
7. **Parameter blocks.** Make parameters explicit and bind them at start; your root‑cause analyses will get 10× easier.

# A.15.2 — U.WorkPlan  \[D]


## 1 · Context (plain‑language motivation)

Operations live on **time**. Even with perfect roles, abilities, and methods, nothing ships unless we **decide when and by whom** concrete runs **should** happen, under what **constraints** and **budgets**. Teams need a first‑class concept for **plans and schedules** that does **not** get confused with:

* the **semantic “way of doing”** (that is `U.Method`),
* the **written recipe** (that is `U.MethodDescription`),
* the **actual execution** (that is `U.Work`), or
* the **state laws** (that is `U.Dynamics`).

`U.WorkPlan` is that missing anchor.

---

## 2 · Problem (what breaks without `WorkPlan`)

1. **“Workflow = schedule” conflation.** Flowcharts or code are used as calendars; resource clashes and SLA misses follow.
2. **Plan/run blur.** Gantt bars or Kanban tickets are reported as if the work already happened; audits and costing degrade.
3. **Spec/time leakage.** People and calendars creep into MethodDescriptions; reuse and staffing agility collapse.
4. **No variance model.** Without planned baselines, deviations in time, cost, and quality cannot be explained or improved.
5. **Structure entanglement.** BoM and org charts get baked into “process” views; plans become brittle and unmaintainable.

| **Assignment vs. assignment**     | Plans may name intended performers; the actual assignment must still be checked at run time.           |
| **Budgets vs. actuals**            | Plans carry targets and reservations; only Work carries actual spend.                                   |

## 4 · Solution — the `U.WorkPlan` as the time‑bound intention to execute Work

### 4.1 Definition

**`U.WorkPlan`** is an **`U.Episteme`** that **declares intended `U.Work` occurrences** over a horizon, with **planned windows**, **dependencies**, **intended performers** (as **role kinds** or **proposed RoleAssignings**), **resource budgets/reservations**, and **acceptance targets**—**within a `U.BoundedContext`**.

> **Strict distinction (memory aid):**
> **Method** = *how in principle*. **MethodDescription** = *how it is written*.
> **WorkPlan** = *when, by whom in intent, under which constraints*.
> **Work** = *how it went this time*.

### 4.2 Plan Items (what a `WorkPlan` is made of)

A `U.WorkPlan` **contains Plan Items** (think: scheduled tasks/ops), each of which typically states:

1. **Target Method/Spec** — the **Method** to be enacted and the **MethodDescription** intended for enactment.
2. **Planned window** — e.g., earliest start/latest finish, timebox, recurrence (cron‑like), blackout periods.
3. **Role requirements** — **role kinds** required (not people), optional **proposed RoleAssigning(s)** if pre‑assignment is allowed in the context.
4. **Capability thresholds** — minimal abilities required of the performer (checked at run time).
5. **Resource budgets/reservations** — planned energy/materials/machine slots/money; reservations on assets.
6. **Dependencies** — precedence/overlap permissions; gates/approvals.
7. **Acceptance targets** — quality windows/SLA targets to be judged when Work completes.
8. **Location/asset constraints** — where the run is expected to take place.
9. **Links to Service promises** (if any) — external commitments that this plan aims to satisfy.

> **Didactic guardrail:** **No logs or actuals** belong in a WorkPlan; **no step logic** or solver internals either—that’s the Method/Spec.

### 4.3 Clear distinctions (lexical sanity for “schedule/process/workflow”)

| If you say…                                 | In FPF it is…                                        | Why                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| “The **schedule** for tomorrow’s surgeries” | **`U.WorkPlan`**                                     | Calendar of intended runs (who/when constraints). |
| “The **workflow** for appendectomy”         | **`U.MethodDescription`** (and `U.Method`)                  | Recipe and semantic way, not a calendar.          |
| “The **process** already ran at 10:00”      | **`U.Work`**                                         | A dated run with resources and outcomes.          |
| “The **thermodynamic process** path”        | **`U.Work`** (occurrence) + **`U.Dynamics`** (model) | A realized trajectory plus its model, not a plan. |
| “The **plan** assigns Dr. Lee”              | **WorkPlan** naming an **intended** RoleAssigning      | assignment is still validated at run time.       |
| “The **budget** for Shift‑B”                | **WorkPlan** (planned ledger)                        | Actual costs land on **Work**, not on the plan.   |

> **L‑SCHED (lexical rule).** In this document, words like **schedule**, **calendar**, **rota**, **Gantt**, **plan** point to **`U.WorkPlan`** unless explicitly redefined by a bounded context glossary.

### 4.4 Plan mereology (composition of plans ≠ composition of methods or runs)

Keep three separations crystal‑clear:

* **Method composition** (design‑time semantics) → produces **new Methods**.
* **Work composition** (run‑time occurrences) → produces **parent/child runs** with overlaps/episodes.
* **Plan mereology** (epistemic structure) → organizes **Plan Items** for coordination (phases, sprints, shifts), with **precedence** and **resource reservations**.

**Common relations among Plan Items:**

* **`Precedes_pl` / `DependsOn_pl`** — start/finish constraints and gates.
* **`MayOverlap_pl` / `MutuallyExclusive_pl`** — allowed overlaps vs exclusive windows.
* **`Refines_pl`** — a child plan item tightens windows/budgets of a parent.
* **`Alternative_pl`** — planned alternatives (e.g., backup rig, backup team).

**Didactic rule:** A Plan Item **does not force** an identical Work shape; mapping is via **fulfilment** and **variance** (see §6).

### 4.5 How `WorkPlan` meets `Work` (fulfilment & variance)

When reality happens, each `U.Work` may:

* **Fulfil** a Plan Item — link `plannedAs → PlanItem`.
* **Partially fulfil** — multiple Work instances share one Plan Item (e.g., split run), or one Work fulfils several Plan Items (e.g., consolidated batch).
* **Deviate** — execute with method/spec substitution, different window, different performer (still valid or policy‑exception).
* **Be unplanned** — Work with no Plan Item (emergency, ad‑hoc); must be labeled as such.

**Variance dimensions** the plan expects to report on:

* **Schedule variance (Δt):** early/late vs planned window.
* **Cost variance (Δc):** actual resource spend vs budget.
* **Scope variance:** different Method/Spec than planned (with justification).
* **Quality variance:** acceptance verdict vs target.
* **Assignment variance:** intended vs actual RoleAssigning.

> **Manager’s view:** A plan that cannot report variance is a calendar picture, not a management tool.

## 5 · What a good `WorkPlan` states (review checklist)

Use this as a human‑readable checklist (not a rigid schema):

1. **Horizon & cadence** (e.g., “W36 surgeries, daily ETL”).
2. **Plan Items** with: target Method/Spec, planned windows, dependencies.
3. **Role requirements** (kinds) and **intended assignments** (optional, context‑lawful).
4. **Capability thresholds** and **safety envelopes**.
5. **Resource budgets** and **reservations** on assets.
6. **Acceptance targets** (SLA/quality windows).
7. **Bridges** if plan spans **multiple contexts** (operations ↔ audit/regulatory).
8. **Baseline/version** and **change notes** (so variance is attributable).
9. **Policy pointers** (episode policy, overlap policy for Work roll‑ups if needed for KPIs).
10. **Exceptions path** (how ad‑hoc/emergency work is planned post‑factum).

## 6 · Archetypal grounding (parallel domains)

### 6.1 Hospital OR day plan (shift rota + cases)

* **WorkPlan:** `OR_DayPlan_2025‑08‑12`.
* **Plan Items:** `Case#1 Appendectomy`, `Case#2 Hernia`, with windows, Context assignments, and surgeon **role kinds**; anesthetist **intended RoleAssigning** provided.
* **Budgets:** OR time blocks, consumables envelopes.
* **Fulfilment:** Each surgery Work links to its Plan Item; variances computed (over‑run time, substitutions).

### 6.2 Fab maintenance weekend (asset reservations)

* **WorkPlan:** `Fab_Maintenance_W36`.
* **Plan Items:** `Tool_42 chamber clean`, `Tool_13 calibration`; **MutuallyExclusive\_pl** with production slots.
* **Reservations:** nitrogen, DI water, metrology window.
* **Fulfilment:** Actual clean Work happens earlier; variance logged as **early** with cost underrun.

### 6.3 Data‑center rollout (multi‑context plan)

* **WorkPlan:** `DC_Rollout_Phase‑2`.
* **Bridges:** Ops context ↔ Security Audit context (different acceptance targets).
* **Plan Items:** `Deploy Service A`, `Pen‑test A`; dependencies across contexts.
* **Fulfilment:** Deployment Work passes ops targets; audit Work passes later—variance reported per context.

---

## 7 · Bias‑Annotation (as in E‑cluster)

* **Lenses tested:** `Did`, `Prag`, `Arch`, `Epist`.
* **Scope declaration:** Universal; meanings of windows/budgets/permissions are **context‑local** via `U.BoundedContext`.
* **Rationale:** Elevates **planning/scheduling** to a first‑class episteme that coordinates Methods, RoleAssignings, and Work without conflation.

## A.17 (A.CHR‑NORM) — Canonical “Characteristic” `[A]`

### 1\. Context

Every FPF architheory needs to **measure** various aspects of systems or knowledge artifacts. A dedicated measurement backbone (see **C.MM‑CHR**, Measurement & Metrics Characterization) already exists, prescribing the **CSLC discipline** – i.e. define a **Characteristic**, choose a **Scale** (with a **Unit** if applicable), record a **Level/Value**, and thus obtain a **Coordinate** on that scale, optionally mapping to a **Score** via a **Gauge**. However, historically multiple near-synonyms (“axis”, “dimension”, “property”, “feature”) have been used interchangeably for “what is being measured,” and often the _aspect itself_ gets conflated with _how it is expressed_ (units, ranges, labels). This pattern enters the FPF **Kernel lexicon** to **canonize a single term** for the measured aspect and enforce a clear separation between **what** is measured and **how** it is measured.

### 2\. Problem

When measurement concepts are not kept rigorously distinct, several issues arise:

-   **Polysemy at the anchor.** Teams say “dimension” or “feature” but mean slightly different things, so the very trait being measured is ambiguous.
    
-   **Arity mistakes.** A relational quality (e.g. similarity between two items) might be treated as if it were an intrinsic property of one item, or vice versa, leading to logical errors.
    
-   **Expression conflation.** The aspect being measured is often mixed up with its expression – for example, using “scale” or “axis” to mean both the quality _and_ its unit or range. This leads to **unsafe arithmetic** (averaging ordinal ranks, comparing raw numbers from incompatible scales, etc.) because values get interpreted out of context.
    

In summary, projects lacking a canonical terminology for metrics risk miscommunication and pseudo-quantitative operations. Measurements of physical quantities, architectural attributes, or performance scores end up on **incommensurate rails** due to inconsistent naming and handling.

### 3\. Forces

-   **F1 – Single anchor of meaning.** Any numeric value is meaningless unless one can ask “value of _what_?”. The measurement’s meaning must be anchored in a single clearly named aspect.
    
-   **F2 – Arity clarity.** Some characteristics apply to a single entity (e.g. its mass or length), while others inherently relate multiple entities (e.g. distance between two points, coupling between modules, agreement between judges). If arity isn’t explicit, claims and calculations become corrupted.
    
-   **F3 – Scale integrity.** Different kinds of scales permit different operations – e.g. you can average temperatures (ratio scale) but not ranks or grades (ordinal scale) without losing meaning. If one mixes values without regard to scale type or units, the result is nonsense (**pseudo-arithmetic**).
    
-   **F4 – Composition discipline.** In complex evaluations, multiple measurements may need to be combined. Without a disciplined approach, people might perform ad-hoc math on apples and oranges (adding scores from unrelated characteristics, etc.). A proper pattern must require any combination to go through a defined monotonic **Gauge** (e.g. a weighted formula) instead of arbitrary aggregation.
    
-   **F5 – Transdisciplinarity.** The measurement framework should work for **any domain**. The same conceptual scaffold must serve physical science (e.g. lab temperature readings), software engineering (e.g. module cohesion ratings), and even subjective assessments (e.g. figure-skating scores) without bias. One vocabulary, many CG‑frames.
    
-   **F6 – Open-endedness.** As systems evolve, their performance or quality metrics also evolve. Rigid life-cycle stage labels (“Phase 1, Phase 2…”) don’t capture iterative improvement. The pattern should favor an **open-ended state-space** view (revisiting states via checklists, as in an RSG – **RoleStateGraph** with re-entry) over any fixed lifecycle with “terminal” stages.
    

### 4\. Solution

**Establish “Characteristic” as the one canonical construct for “what is measured.”** In every FPF context, the _aspect or trait_ being measured MUST be referred to as a **Characteristic**. This term replaces “axis” or “dimension” in normative usage (those may appear _only_ as explanatory aliases in Plain register). By fixing a single name and schema, we cleanly separate a **Characteristic** from its **Scale** (and **Unit**), and from any observed **Value/Level** on that scale. The solution also differentiates single-entity vs multi-entity cases and binds all measurements to the standard CSLC sequence.

To enforce this solution, the following rules apply:

-   **A17-R1 (Canonical term).** In all normative models and specifications, the measured aspect **SHALL** be referred to as a **Characteristic**. (Legacy terms “Axis” or “Dimension” are retired from technical vocabulary – see Part J Lexicon Update.)
    
-   **A17-R2 (Entity vs. relation subtype).** Each Characteristic **MUST** declare its intended _arity_. An **Entity-Characteristic** applies to exactly one bearer (e.g. _Temperature_ of a reactor, _Evolvability_ of a software module), whereas a **Relation-Characteristic** applies to an ordered tuple of two or more bearers (e.g. _Distance_ between two sensors, _Coupling_ between modules, _Agreement_ among reviewers). The arity is part of the definition and **must be explicit** wherever it’s not obvious from naming.
    
-   **A17-R3 (Characteristic space).** Any set of defined Characteristics spans a multi-dimensional **CharacteristicSpace**. Movement or evolution is then described as trajectories through this space (with states revisited or refined over time), rather than as a linear lifecycle through preset phases. This ensures measurements feed into open-ended state modeling rather than locking into “end states.”
    
-   **A17-R4 (Lexical guardrails).** Normative text **SHALL** use only the canonical measurement terms: **Characteristic, Scale, Level, Value, Coordinate, Score, Gauge, Unit**. Synonyms like _axis_, _dimension_, _metric_, _grade_, _property_, etc., are **forbidden in formal usage**. (They may appear in narrative explanations or user-facing documentation _only if_ clearly defined as aliases for the canonical terms.) Authors **MUST** not use deprecated terms in identifiers or formal statements, and any didactic alias should be introduced with an explicit mapping to the official term. These lexical rules uphold clarity and are further detailed in **E.10 LEX‑BUNDLE**. 

- **A17-R5 (Symbol policy).** **Γ** reserved for holonic composition; **𝒢 : Coordinate→Score** for metric‑level gauges; **MUST NOT** be conflated; documents **SHALL NOT** reuse Γ for gauges. **If an ordered Scale is declared, polarity SHALL be fixed; 𝒢 MUST be monotone** w.r.t. that polarity.

- **A17-R6 (Declared polarity).** Every ordered Scale **SHALL** declare one of: **↑‑better**, **↓‑better**, or **non‑applicable** (for purely nominal scales). For interval/ratio scales, polarity fixes the intended order of comparison.

- **A17-R7 (Monotonicity against polarity).** If a template declares an **ordering polarity** on its Scale (↑ better / ↓ better), then **𝒢 MUST be monotone** w\.r.t. that polarity: higher‑is‑better (resp. lower‑is‑better) in coordinates **implies** ≥ (resp. ≤) in scores.

- **A17-R8 (Arity declaration).** Authors **SHALL** mark a Characteristic as **`U.EntityCharacteristic`** (applies to exactly one bearer) or **`U.RelationCharacteristic`** (applies to a relation of cardinality ≥ 2). Examples: *Cohesion* → entity‑level; *Coupling* → relation‑level.

- **A17-R9 (Relational scale anchors).** For relation‑level cases, the Scale’s admissible values **SHALL** be defined over the **tuple** domain (e.g., distances, similarities, inter‑role latencies). Ambiguity that re‑reads a relational Characteristic as unary is **forbidden**.

- **A17-R10 (Intension vs Description).** The **Characteristic** remains the **intensional object**; any rubric, catalogue of levels, or examples are **descriptions**. Keep the intensional Characteristic distinct from its descriptive episteme (cf. `U.Episteme` roles: Object–Concept–Symbol).

## 4.9 CharacteristicSpace & Change Reasoning *(Normative/Clarifying)*

**R17 — CharacteristicSpace declaration.** When an architheory reasons about **change**, it **SHALL** name the **CharacteristicSpace** (the set of Characteristics, with Scales, units, and topology assumptions) in which motion is considered.

**R18 — RSG framing, not lifecycle.** Change narratives **SHALL** be framed as movement on a **reachable‑states graph (RSG)** with **checklists** that certify state acquisition; **“lifecycle”** staging is **deprecated**. *(A.17 conforms to the open‑ended evolution stance of the Kernel.)*

**I7 — Vector interpretation.** A **U.Coordinate** vector may collect multiple coordinates for multi‑Characteristic reasoning; composition into a single Score, if desired, is an **explicit new 𝒢** on that vector.


### 5\. Archetypal Grounding (System & Episteme Examples)

**In a physical system (`U.System`):** Consider a **Distance** Characteristic defined for a pair of physical objects. For example, two machines in a factory have a Distance of 3.5 meters between them. Here _Distance_ is a Relation-Characteristic (applies to the pair), with an associated Scale (e.g. a ratio scale in meters), and the measured 3.5 m is a **Coordinate** on that scale. If we instead look at an **Engine Temperature** Characteristic (unary), a particular engine might have a Temperature of 350 K at some moment – _Temperature_ (the Characteristic) is clearly separated from how it’s measured (Scale in Kelvin) and the reading (350, a Coordinate on that scale).

**In an epistemic context (`U.Episteme`):** Consider a **Formality** Characteristic to rate a documentation artifact’s rigor. We might define an ordinal Scale with named Levels such as _Informal_, _Semi-formal_, _Formal_. A given specification document can then be said to have _High Formality_ – meaning it occupies the “Formal” **Level** on the Formality Scale. Here _Formality_ (Characteristic) captures _what_ we measure about the document, while the tiered Scale (with qualitative levels) expresses _how_ we categorize it. Because we use an ordinal scale, we can rank documents by Formality, but we would not average “Semi-formal” and “Formal” (avoiding meaningless arithmetic on an ordinal metric). In another knowledge context example, one could define a Characteristic **Reliability** for a knowledge source with a percentage Scale from 0 to 100%. An article’s reliability might be 85% – which is only interpretable by knowing it refers to “Reliability” on a 0–100% Scale (i.e. a specific Coordinate on that Characteristic’s scale).

### 6\. Bias-Annotation

This pattern is deliberately **domain-neutral** and introduces no bias toward any particular discipline or measurement type. By enforcing a uniform lexicon, A.17 actually mitigates bias: it prevents **disciplinary jargon** from creeping into core definitions (ensuring, for instance, that a software metric isn’t given a vague custom term when it’s fundamentally a Characteristic). The **Didactic lens** is strongly served: using one precise name per concept improves clarity for all audiences. There is a slight initial cost in re-labeling legacy terms (e.g. renaming “dimensions” to Characteristics), but this is offset by the long-term **Cognitive Elegance (P‑1)** – the framework becomes easier to learn and less prone to misinterpretation. No single domain’s terminology dominates, and the pattern explicitly supports both quantitative (physics-like) and qualitative (judgment-based) measurements, reflecting **Pragmatic neutrality**. The requirement of open-ended state-space thinking aligns with **P‑10 (Open-Ended Evolution)**, ensuring we don’t bake in lifecycle biases that assume development must terminate at a final stage. In summary, A.17 imposes a disciplined vocabulary that is broad enough for all fields and free of hidden assumptions, thereby avoiding subtle ontological or cultural biases in the measurement model.

### 7\. Conformance Checklist

When authoring or reviewing FPF-compliant metrics, use the following checklist to ensure **Characteristic normalization** is applied:

1.  **Declared Characteristic:** Have you explicitly named a **Characteristic** for each aspect being measured, instead of using generic terms? (e.g. use _“Reliability”_ as a Characteristic name rather than saying “this dimension”).
    
2.  **Arity Explicit:** Is it clear whether the Characteristic is unary or relational? If a metric involves a relationship, are the participating entities (pair, tuple, etc.) identified in its definition?
    
3.  **Separate Scale/Unit:** For each Characteristic, have you defined the **Scale** (and **Unit**, if applicable) separately, rather than embedding units or ordinal terms in the name of the Characteristic? (e.g. _“Length (m)”_ should be captured as Characteristic = _Length_, Unit = _meter_).
    
4.  **Scale-appropriate operations:** Are you only performing comparisons or calculations that make sense for the declared scale type? (No averaging of ranks, no mixing of units – ensure **ordinal** Characteristics aren’t treated like numbers, and **interval/ratio** values respect zero and units.)
    
5.  **No implicit aggregation:** If multiple measurement readings are combined, is there a defined **Gauge** (with monotonic logic) that produces a **Score**? Avoid any ad-hoc “overall score” that simply adds or averages raw values from different Characteristics.
    
6.  **Canonical terminology in use:** Are you using the terms _Characteristic_, _Scale_, _Level/Value_, _Coordinate_, _Score_, _Gauge_, _Unit_ in all formal descriptions? Confirm that no deprecated synonyms (axis, dimension, etc.) appear in technical content or identifiers (they can appear in Plain explanations only with proper reference to the canonical term).
    
7.  **Open-ended progression:** (If applicable) When modeling progress or change using metrics, have you considered using a state-space of Characteristics rather than a fixed sequence of phases? This check is to encourage leveraging the open-ended nature of CharacteristicSpaces, especially in evolutionary or iterative processes.
    
_(Failure to satisfy the above indicates a violation of this pattern’s intent. The **LEX-BUNDLE** rules in E.10 provide automated checks for term usage, and MM-CHR templates enforce explicit Characteristic/Scale definitions.)_

### 8\. Consequences

By instituting **Characteristic** as the single term and enforcing the CSLC structure, this pattern yields several positive outcomes:

-   **Unambiguous metrics:** Every measurement has a single, well-defined anchor of meaning – the Characteristic – eliminating guesswork about “what is this number about?”.
    
-   **Separation of concerns:** We cleanly separate _what_ is measured from _how_ it’s represented. The Characteristic names the quality of interest, while the Scale/Unit defines the expression. A raw value now **means nothing by itself** – it must be read as “X units on the Y scale of Z Characteristic,” which greatly reduces misinterpretation.
    
-   **Unary vs. relational clarity:** The explicit distinction between Entity-Characteristic and Relation-Characteristic ensures that relational properties (like “distance between A and B” or “consistency among experts”) aren’t mistakenly treated as inherent properties of a single object. This guards against logical errors and data modeling mistakes.
    
-   **Cross-domain comparability:** All measurements, regardless of domain, follow the same **CSLC** rails. This means a temperature in Kelvin and a reliability score in percent can each be traced through Characteristic → Scale → Coordinate. They can’t be directly compared unless designed to be, which is _good_: any composite scoring must be done via an explicit **Gauge** mapping to a common **Score** scale. The pattern thus enables interoperability (through well-defined Score bridges) while preventing illegitimate comparisons.
    
-   **Consistent evolution framing:** By retiring the idea of a bespoke “lifecycle” for every process and instead viewing changes as movement in a CharacteristicSpace, the pattern aligns metric thinking with state-based reasoning (e.g. as used in dynamic models). There is no artificial “final state” for improvement – a system can always evolve to a new coordinate without violating a lifecycle contract. This open-ended view encourages continuous improvement and refinement, echoing FPF’s emphasis on evolutionary development.
    

There are few downsides. One consequence is that modelers must learn the canonical terms and possibly refactor existing documentation (a short-term effort). Also, enforcing scale integrity means quick-and-dirty aggregate scores are not allowed unless justified via a Gauge – this introduces a healthy “pause” to ensure composite metrics are well-founded. Overall, the benefits in clarity and correctness far outweigh the overhead. Teams gain a _lingua franca_ for metrics, and the risk of metric abuse (mixing apples and oranges) is significantly reduced.

### 9\. Rationale

The Canonical Characteristic pattern is a direct response to recurring measurement pitfalls. By insisting on “one precise name per concept”, it upholds **Strict Distinction (A.7)**, ensuring that the framework never treats two different ideas as one. For instance, earlier practice might label both a requirement category and its score as “dimension,” causing confusion; with A.17, the _aspect_ is a Characteristic and its _score_ is separate, so each idea has its place. This clarity is pedagogically vital (**P‑2 Didactic Primacy**): readers and contributors immediately know what a term means and how to interpret any value associated with it.

The solution also draws on fundamentals of measurement theory (Stevens’ levels of measurement) to prevent misuse. By encoding scale types and unit handling into our patterns, we avoid the “pseudo-quantitative” fallacies – no more averaging things like _risk levels_ or adding up _grades_ as if they were true numbers. In effect, A.17 puts a safeguard around **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance and P‑7 Ontological Parsimony**: we use a minimal, universal set of measurement constructs, and we avoid bloating the conceptual space with domain-specific or redundant terms. One canonical set of terms also makes the framework more teachable and **composable across contexts**, since architheories and projects aren’t inventing new synonyms that others must decipher.

Importantly, distinguishing Entity vs Relation Characteristics future-proofs the reasoning model. It enforces a modeling rigor seen in domains like physics (where properties vs. relations are carefully distinguished) and brings it to architecture and knowledge domains. This rigor supports advanced reasoning in FPF – for example, **A.3.3 (Dynamics)** can treat system state variables as a well-defined set of Characteristics, and assurance patterns can trace **evidence metrics** unambiguously to the exact aspect measured. It also means any attempt to compare or combine metrics has to be explicit (via Gauges), which inherently improves **transparency and auditability** (a key FPF goal).

Finally, retiring the “lifecycle” vocabulary in favor of state-space trajectories aligns with FPF’s **open-ended evolution** principle. It acknowledges that improvement is not a predefined path but a navigable space. This shift in mindset (from lifecycle stages to checklisted state transitions) removes an implicit bias that systems _ought_ to reach a “final” maturity stage – instead, it keeps the door open for perpetual refinement, which is philosophically aligned with continuous learning and adaptation.

In summary, A.17 is the linchpin that turns a loose collection of measurement practices into a **coherent, principle-driven system**. It rationalizes the language, thereby rationalizing thought: by speaking in one clear voice about measurements, FPF ensures that every number in the system can be trusted to answer “value of what, on what scale, relative to what context.” This rationale is reflected in improved model integrity and cross-domain trust in the meaning of metrics.

### 10\. Relations

-   **Builds on / Elaborates:** _FPF Core Measurement Schema_ (as outlined in C.16). A.17 lifts the metric template concepts from C.16 into a kernel-level rule. It also reinforces **A.7 Strict Distinction**, by giving each measurement concept a unique name and forbidding overloaded terms.
    
-   **Constrains:** All other patterns and architheories that define or use metrics. For example, **A.3.3 `U.Dynamics`** (system dynamics) must name its state variables as Characteristics with proper scales (it cannot refer to them loosely as “KPIs” without context). Similarly, any **Service-level agreements (A.2.3 `U.Service`)** or **assurance calculations (B.3, D.3 patterns)** that involve measurements are governed by this canonical terminology (no unwarranted synonyms or unit confusion per ISO/IEC 80000, ISO/IEC 25024, QUDT, SOSA/SSN best practices). The pattern’s lexical rules are part of the **LEX-BUNDLE** (E.10) – any FPF-conformant context must adhere to these naming conventions.
    
-   **Coordinates with:** **A.18 (CSLC-KERNEL)**, which defines the minimal **Characteristic/Scale/Level/Coordinate** contract in detail. A.17 provides the vocabulary and basic distinctions (what is a Characteristic, and its arity), while A.18 applies this to ensure each measurement template is well-formed. Also coordinates with **C.KD-CAL** and **C.CHR-CAL** (Knowledge Dynamics Calculus, Characterization Calculus) – those architheories use the Characteristic/Scale constructs to build domain-specific metrics (e.g. knowledge quality scores) and rely on A.17’s canon for consistency.
    
-   **Anticipates:** **E.10 Lexical Discipline** rules – A.17’s enforcement of a single term and controlled aliases is a concrete instance of the lexical uniformity mandated in E.10. It also paves the way for **F.7 Concept-Set Bridges** in Unification patterns, since external ontologies for quantities (ISO 80000, QUDT, etc.) can be mapped cleanly onto FPF Characteristics now that the term is fixed. In short, A.17 is a foundational lexicon pattern that a) ensures internal consistency and b) simplifies alignment with external standards for measurable properties.
    

## A.18 (A.CSLC‑KERNEL) — Minimal CSLC in Kernel (Characteristic ⟷ Scale ⟷ Level ⟷ Coordinate) `[A]`

**Aliases (for narrative use only):** _“Axis”_ (≈ Characteristic), _“Point”_ (≈ Coordinate). _(These colloquial aliases may be used in Plain language **explanations**, but never in formal identifiers or normative text.)_

### 1\. Context

We often need to **characterize some aspect** of a subject (be it a single artefact or a relationship between artefacts) in a rigorous way. Whether it’s recording a physical quantity, an architectural property, or a performance rating, the characterization must:

-   remain _domain-neutral_ (work for engineering metrics, subjective scores, etc.),
    
-   ensure that two measurements are **comparable if and only if** they share the same defined aspect and scale, and
    
-   accommodate both **ordered tiers** (qualitative levels like Low/Medium/High) and **numeric magnitudes** (continuous or interval values) without mixing them up.
    

In FPF’s kernel, the **CSLC pattern** (CG‑frame–Scale–Level–Coordinate) provides the minimal vocabulary and constraints to achieve this. It defines how one **Characteristic** ties to one **Scale**, and how any measured **value** can be treated as a **Coordinate** on that scale (with an optional named **Level** if the scale is discrete or tiered). The context here is the need for a _unified contract_ so that every single measurement in any architheory can be interpreted and compared on common grounds.

### 2\. Problem

**Uninterpretable values.** A raw number or label means nothing without knowing **what aspect it measures** and **how it is measured**. The string “4”, the label “High”, or the real number 9.81 convey no insight unless we know **which Characteristic** they pertain to and the **Scale** that gives them meaning. In cross-disciplinary work this ambiguity is magnified: a “5” could be a risk rank (ordinal), a length in meters (ratio), or a satisfaction score (perhaps interval). Common failure modes include:

-   In **ordinal settings** (e.g. expertise levels _Novice < Skilled < Expert_), one can **rank** values but not meaningfully add or average them. Treating ordinal labels like numbers (e.g. averaging _Novice=1, Expert=3_) produces invalid results.
    
-   In **cardinal settings** (e.g. seconds, meters, degrees Kelvin), arithmetic operations do make sense – but only if units are respected and zero is meaningful (for ratio scales). If we strip away units or mix scales (seconds vs. minutes), we again get nonsense.
    

Without a strict contract, one team might treat “High” and “Medium” as having a numeric gap, another might average **4** (on a 5-star scale) with **4** (as 4 seconds) because both are “4”. **Inconsistent practices make cross-domain reasoning impossible.** We need a kernel-level solution that _fixes_: (a) the **aspect being measured**, (b) the **scheme by which it’s measured**, and (c) the **type of scale structure** (ordinal vs. metric), _and_ that ensures each reported value is bound to that scheme. At the same time, the contract should _not_ force artificial numeric detail where it isn’t applicable (e.g. we shouldn’t assign meaningless numbers to purely qualitative tiers just to satisfy a structure).

### 3\. Forces

-   **F1 – Transdisciplinarity.** The pattern must uniformly handle measurements in _physical domains_ (e.g. length, time, temperature), _system attributes_ (e.g. a module’s coupling or reliability), and _human judgments_ (e.g. user satisfaction scores). It needs to be neither overly quantitative (alienating softer domains) nor overly qualitative (lacking precision for hard science).
    
-   **F2 – Comparability vs. freedom.** We want to compare “like with like” – e.g. two readings of the same Characteristic on the same Scale – with absolute confidence. At the same time, the system should allow **different Scales for the same Characteristic** when necessary (for example, one project might measure Quality on a 0–5 star scale, another on a 0–100 percentage scale). The pattern must permit such flexibility _without_ letting those differing scales be conflated.
    
-   **F3 – Ordinal vs. cardinal integrity.** The contract should preserve the nature of the data: **order-only vs order+distance**. If something is ordinal (ranks, grades), the framework should prevent unwarranted numeric operations on it. If it’s cardinal (real-valued with units), the framework should enable arithmetic but still keep track of units and zero. In essence, it must protect ordinal data from “leaking” into interval arithmetic.
    
-   **F4 – Named tiers vs. continuous magnitudes.** In many domains, **named Levels** (tiers or grades) are useful – e.g. Technology Readiness Levels or bond credit ratings – whereas in others, a continuous scale is needed. The pattern should support **optional Level labels** (for tiered scales) _without forcing_ every scale to have such labels. In other words, Levels are an add-on for discrete/tiered scales, not a requirement for truly continuous measures.
    
-   **F5 – Method agnosticism.** The kernel contract should say _what_ must be defined (Characteristic, Scale, etc.) but **not prescribe how measurements are obtained**. Whether a value comes from a sensor reading, a simulation, or an expert judgment is up to the respective architheory (e.g. Sys-CAL vs. KD-CAL). The pattern must not bake in any process or scoring methodology; it only ensures that once a measurement exists, it’s well-formed and comparable. This avoids locking in any particular assessment method.
    

### 4\. Solution

**Adopt a minimal “one characteristic – one scale – one coordinate (value)” contract for all measurements.** In the FPF kernel, any metric must bind **exactly one Characteristic to exactly one Scale**, and any observation produces **one Coordinate (value)** on that Scale (with an optional **Level** name if the scale has discrete tiers). We nickname this the **CSLC clause**:

> **Exactly one Characteristic + exactly one Scale ⇒ one Coordinate (value), with an optional Level.**

Concretely, the parts of this clause are defined as follows:

-   **Characteristic:** the aspect or feature being measured (the “CG‑frame” along which comparison is made). It answers “_What are we measuring?_” – e.g. _Distance, Temperature, Quality, Reliability_.
    
-   **Scale:** the organized set of possible values that the Characteristic can take, including the type of scale (_ordinal_, _interval_, or _ratio_), the measurement **Unit** (if applicable), and any bounds or structure. The Scale defines “_How do we measure it?_” – e.g. “meters on a linear scale from 0 up to 1000” or “ratings 1 through 5 with ordering only”.
    
-   **Coordinate:** a concrete measured value that locates the subject on the chosen scale. This could be a number (for a numeric scale) or a category label (for an ordinal scale). It answers “_What is the result?_” – e.g. 7.4 (meters), or _Expert_ (level).
    
-   **Level (optional):** a named **tier or category** on the scale, used only if the scale is tiered or discretized. For example, an ordinal scale might have Levels _Low, Medium, High_. A Level is essentially a human-friendly label for certain coordinates or ranges. On purely continuous scales, **Level** is not used.
    

Using this **CSLC structure**, every measurement is unambiguous and self-contained: the Characteristic tells us the context, the Scale tells us how to interpret the value, and the Coordinate is the outcome on that scale (with a Level label if appropriate). Notably, this pattern _forbids bundling multiple characteristics into one metric_ – each metric template is one-characteristic-per-template to keep semantics crisp. If something needs to assess multiple factors, it should be modeled as multiple CSLC metrics or a higher-level composite (see §8 below). This one-aspect-one-scale rule is what allows unambiguous comparison and prevents hidden complexity.

Finally, the solution ensures **tier optionality**: If a domain uses named Levels, we include them; if not, we don’t force it. For example, one can have a _Bug Severity_ Characteristic with Levels {Minor, Major, Critical} on an ordinal scale, whereas a _Length_ Characteristic would have a continuous scale (no predefined levels, just units). Both fit the pattern.

### 5\. Archetypal Grounding (System & Episteme Examples)

**In a physical scenario (`U.System`):** Consider an athlete’s long jump. We define a Characteristic **Jump Distance** with a Scale “meters (m)” ranging from 0 upward (ratio scale with meters as the unit). When the athlete jumps and lands at 7.45 m, we record a **Coordinate** of _7.45 m_ for the Jump Distance Characteristic. Here, Jump Distance is the Characteristic, the meter-scale is the declared Scale, and _7.45 m_ is the value (Coordinate). Because this is a cardinal measurement, we can meaningfully say one jump is 1.5 m longer than another, etc. Now consider another metric in the system: **Battery Health** of a device, which might be categorized qualitatively. We could define an ordinal Scale with Levels like _Good, Fair, Poor_ for the Battery Health Characteristic. If a particular device is rated “Poor”, that is a Coordinate on the Battery Health scale (with _Poor_ as the Level name). No arithmetic is done on these labels, but we can order devices by health (Good > Fair > Poor). Both examples illustrate the one-characteristic-one-scale rule: the jump’s distance is not combined with any other aspect; the battery’s health is evaluated on its own defined scale.

**In a knowledge context (`U.Episteme`):** Consider measuring an author’s expertise in a certain domain. We introduce a Characteristic **Expertise Level** for a person, with an ordinal Scale defining tiers such as _Novice, Competent, Expert_. Alice might be assessed at _Expert_ level in software engineering – that’s a **Coordinate** on the Expertise Level scale for the Characteristic “Software Engineering Expertise”. Bob might be at _Competent_. We cannot average Alice’s and Bob’s levels, but we can say the scale is ordered (_Expert_ > _Competent_ > _Novice_). For a more quantitative episteme example, consider a Characteristic **Hypothesis Confidence** for a scientific claim, with a Scale 0–1 (or 0–100%) representing probability or confidence level (ratio scale). One hypothesis might have a confidence of 0.95, another 0.7; these are Coordinates on the Confidence scale. We can compare them numerically (0.95 is higher than 0.7, and 0.95 _implies_ a stronger belief), and we could even combine multiple confidence values through Bayesian formulas (if justified) – but crucially, we would only do so in a way that respects their scale (probabilities combined properly, not treated as arbitrary scores). The Expertise Level and Hypothesis Confidence examples show how the CSLC pattern accommodates both an ordinal qualitative measure and a continuous quantitative measure in the knowledge domain, each with one Characteristic and one defined Scale.

### 6\. Bias-Annotation

The CSLC-Kernel pattern is crafted to be **maximally inclusive of different measurement types** while imposing just enough structure to ensure consistency. It does not privilege any particular domain or modality of measurement: a subjective 5-star rating is treated with the same formal rigor as a physical length in meters. In terms of the FPF principle lenses, this pattern consciously balances the **Architectural/Ontological** needs (clear structure for data) with the **Pragmatic/Didactic** needs (flexibility and clarity for users). There is little risk of cross-domain bias here because the pattern explicitly supports both extremes (ordinal and ratio, qualitative and quantitative). By remaining **method-agnostic**, it avoids bias toward certain validation techniques – e.g. it doesn’t assume every measurement comes from an instrument (it could come from expert judgment just as well). One might argue the pattern enforces a somewhat formal approach to what could be informal measures (forcing definition of scale and characteristic), but this formalism is lightweight and is precisely what makes the metric interpretable. In summary, A.18 embodies **neutrality**: it’s a container that fits any content as long as that content is well-labeled. It reinforces **P‑2 (Didactic Primacy)** by making all metrics self-explanatory in terms of what and how, and respects **P‑1 (Cognitive Elegance)** by using a minimal, uniform scheme. No cultural or disciplinary assumptions are baked in – an anthropologist’s “Cultural Significance” scale can live alongside an engineer’s “Voltage” scale with equal status. The pattern’s requirement for declaring polarity (“higher is better” vs “lower is better” vs target range) further avoids bias in interpretation – it prevents the assumption that “more is always better,” which might be untrue in many contexts (e.g. for error rates, lower is better). All these considerations ensure that A.18 introduces no hidden skew; it merely provides a fair playing field for all metrics.

### 7\. Conformance Checklist

When defining a new metric template or using measurements, practitioners **SHALL** verify the following:

1.  **One characteristic, one scale:** Each metric **template** binds exactly **one Characteristic** to exactly **one Scale**. If you find a metric trying to cover multiple things at once, split it into separate metrics.
    
2.  **Polarity declared:** For any **ordered** Scale (ordinal/interval/ratio), the **polarity** (“higher‑is‑better”, “lower‑is‑better”, “targeted optimum (symmetric or asymmetric around a declared target)”) **SHALL** be declared at the **template** that binds a Characteristic to a Scale. State whether higher values are better, lower are better, or if an optimal range/target exists. (For example: \*“higher is better” for a performance score, \*“lower is better” for error count, or _“target 37 °C” for body temperature where deviation in either direction is worse_.) This ensures that anyone comparing two values knows which way is “up.”
    
3.  **Unit and level clarity:** If the Scale is quantitative, specify the **Unit** (e.g. _seconds, meters, %_) and make sure all values include or assume that unit. If the Scale has named Levels, list them clearly and use them consistently. Do **not** use the same label to mean different things on different scales, and avoid using unit terms in Characteristic names (the unit belongs with the scale).
    
4.  **Scale-appropriate operations only:** Only perform those comparisons or calculations that are valid for the given scale type. For a nominal scale, you can check equality but not order. For an ordinal scale, you can order or rank values but not do math like “A minus B.” For interval scales, addition/subtraction is OK (with unit conversion if needed), but ratio comparisons (A is twice B) might not make sense without a true zero. For ratio scales, all arithmetic operations are allowed _with proper attention to units_. This check prevents logical errors (e.g. averaging “High” (3) and “Medium” (2) and getting 2.5 — which is meaningless).
    
5.  **No bare numbers:** Never present a raw number or value without its context of Characteristic and Scale. If someone sees “42” in your output, they should _also_ see or know “42 of what, measured how.” A reader who is not aware of the metric’s template should not be left guessing what a given value signifies. In practice, this means labeling reports and data with the metric name or identifier so that values can be traced back to their meaning.
    
6.  **Template bridges for cross-metric comparison:** If you intend to compare or aggregate measurements from **different templates** (different Characteristics/Scales), ensure an explicit **Gauge** or conversion is defined. For example, if you need to combine a “usability score” (0–5 stars) with a “security score” (0–100%), you might define a new **Score** that maps both onto a common 0–10 scale via monotonic functions. Without such a bridge, do not directly mix metrics – keep them separate in analysis. This guarantees that any cross-metric reading has a well-founded basis.
    
7.  **Level optionality respected:** If your Characteristic doesn’t naturally have tiers, don’t force it to have **Level** names (you can leave the Level concept unused). Conversely, if your Characteristic is commonly described in categories, it’s fine to define Levels for clarity. The key is to use the Level field intentionally: either not at all (for truly continuous measures) or in a fixed, **non-overlapping** way (for discrete categories). Do not use “Level” for something that behaves like a continuous value (it would be confusing to assign a label where a number would do, or vice versa).
8. **Comparability test:** Two Coordinates are comparable iff same Characteristic+Scale (incl. unit, polarity). Otherwise — Score‑level only after a declared gauge to a bounded range.

_(The above serve as normative checkpoints. Many of these are automatically supported by using the standard metric templates in software: e.g. the system will enforce one Characteristic per template, require a unit for ratio scales, etc. The **Lexical rules** from A.17/E.10 are assumed: use canonical names and notations for all parts of the metric.)_

### 8\. Consequences

Adopting the minimal CSLC contract in the kernel yields a number of benefits:

-   **Universal interpretability:** Every measurement is intrinsically self-describing. One cannot have a “mystery number” floating around; by design you must know it’s _X (Coordinate) on Y Scale of Z Characteristic_. This dramatically reduces miscommunication in reports and data exchange. An engineer and an analyst can share a metric knowing they interpret it the same way, because the context travels with the value. Level is optional when scale is tiered or discreet. 
    
-   **Safe comparison and aggregation:** Values can only be compared when they belong to the same Characteristic and Scale (or when an authorized Gauge converts them). This prevents the common error of comparing apples to oranges. When cross-comparison is needed, the pattern funnels us into creating a proper normalization (Gauge), which improves the soundness of composite scores. Essentially, it’s now impossible to accidentally average an uptime percentage with a user satisfaction rating, for example, without explicitly defining how to map one to the other.
    
-   **Flexibility across domains:** The pattern is **transdisciplinary**. It doesn’t matter if the measurement is temperature in Kelvin, length in inches, code complexity in “abstract points,” or user satisfaction on a five-level Likert scale – all are handled uniformly. This makes it easier to plug new architheories or domains into FPF, since they don’t need special rules for their metrics; they just instantiate the CSLC template in their context.
    
-   **Ordinal and cardinal handled with equal rigor:** By explicitly classifying scales, the pattern gives ordinal data the respect it deserves (no pretending it’s numeric) and gives ratio data the formal context it needs (units, zero, etc.). This balance means both qualitative assessments and quantitative measurements live side by side, each with their constraints respected. Domains that lean heavily on categorical ratings benefit from the **Level** concept (with no pressure to assign fake numbers), and domains that use real measurements benefit from unit enforcement and type-aware computations.
    
-   **Clarity in multi-factor scoring:** The prohibition of implicit multi-characteristic measures means that any “overall” score or index has to be constructed out of known pieces. This tends to improve the transparency of complex scoring schemes. If an organization wants to create a single index from 5 different metrics, A.18 forces them to introduce a defined Gauge function that combines those 5 Coordinates into one Score, with declared monotonicity and bounds. The consequence is that composite metrics become auditable and debatable (you can examine the weighting or formula) rather than opaque sums.
    
-   **Methodological neutrality (and innovation):** Because the kernel imposes no method for obtaining the values – only how to frame them once obtained – architheories and tool builders are free to innovate in how they measure things. The contract just ensures that once they do, everyone else can understand and use the results correctly. This separation of concerns (what vs. how) accelerates multi-disciplinary collaboration: a social scientist’s observational scale can feed into a systems model without any confusion, as long as it’s couched in the CSLC terms.
    

On the downside, **users must do a bit more upfront work** to define their metrics. The pattern’s requirements (declare Characteristic, define Scale, etc.) mean one cannot simply say “we’ll track a risk score” without further detail. In practice, this is a _desirable_ trade-off: the extra effort (perhaps a few minutes to set up a metric template) prevents far greater confusion down the line. Another possible trade-off is **multiplicity of scales** – the pattern allows the same Characteristic to have multiple scales (in different contexts or versions), which might fragment data if not managed (e.g. two teams measuring “Performance” on different scales). However, it also provides the remedy: make the difference explicit and, if needed, build a conversion Gauge. This explicitness is actually beneficial, as it highlights when “Performance (0–5)” is not directly comparable to “Performance (Percentage)”. In short, any fragmentation is out in the open and can be dealt with via alignment or bridging.

Overall, A.18’s consequences are overwhelmingly positive: **measurements become first-class, well-understood citizens of the model.** The cost is a slight increase in definition effort and discipline, which is a small price for coherence. Once this pattern is in place, higher-level patterns (in Parts B, C, D) that reason about metrics can rely on it. For example, trust calculations (Part D) can assume that any metric they consume has a known scale and meaning, and knowledge dynamics algorithms (Part B or C) can safely combine evidence knowing the comparisons are valid. The minimal CSLC contract is thus a foundational enabler for robust, cross-domain assurance in FPF.

### 9\. Rationale

The rationale behind A.18 is to enforce _semantic clarity_ at the data level, thereby solving a host of downstream problems. Without this pattern, one must constantly ask, “What does this number mean? Can I combine these two values?” – questions that have led to many project errors. By building the answers into the framework (“every number knows its unit, scale, and aspect”), we front-load the work and eliminate ambiguity. The solution directly addresses each force:

-   **Transdisciplinarity:** We include both ordinal and cardinal mechanisms so that no discipline’s metrics are left out. This was informed by observing multi-disciplinary teams: e.g., in a single project, a human factors specialist might rate usability (ordinal) while an engineer measures throughput (ratio). A.18 gives them a common language and prevents one from misusing the other’s data. It embodies the idea that _universal structure enables local freedom_: everyone’s metric can plug in, as long as they specify it properly.
    
-   **Comparability vs. freedom:** The pattern strikes a balance by tying comparability to explicit commonality. If two metrics truly measure the same thing in the same way, then of course you can compare them – they’ll share Characteristic and Scale. If they differ, the framework doesn’t stop you from defining them (freedom), but it does stop you from _conflating_ them inadvertently. The introduction of **polarity** declarations is a direct response to this tension: it adds a tiny burden (must declare “higher is better” etc.) but yields big pay-off in avoiding mis-ordered interpretations and enabling safe composite scoring (monotonic Gauges).
    
-   **Ordinal vs. cardinal separation:** The rationale here is guided by measurement theory: we want to preserve information content. Treating ordinal data with only order operations preserves all its information; doing more (like adding them) injects false information. The pattern’s strictness on scale types forces modelers to be honest about what their data can and cannot do. This not only prevents errors but also encourages **best practices** (e.g. if you find you desperately want to average an ordinal score, perhaps you should refine it into an interval scale in your methodology). The outcome is a framework that respects both the **qualitative** and **quantitative** realms appropriately, aligning with **FPF’s Pillar of Pragmatism** – use formalism where it’s justified, but not beyond its limits.
    
-   **Optional Levels:** Requiring Levels in every case would have been too rigid (not everything has named tiers), but not supporting them would fail domains that rely on them (like maturity models or grading systems). The rationale for making Level _optional_ is to accommodate both. We saw in practice that many metrics naturally form tiers (e.g. technology readiness levels TRL 1–9) and giving them a slot in the model (instead of burying them in definitions) makes those metrics much easier to work with and integrate. Meanwhile, continuous metrics carry no baggage of unused fields. This design was checked against existing standards (like ISO 25024 for quality measures) to ensure we aren’t deviating from industry expectations: indeed, separating the concept (Characteristic) from the scheme (Scale) aligns well with standards, and including an optional categorization aligns with common practice in capability maturity models, etc.
    
-   **Method neutrality:** The decision to _not_ include any measuring procedures in A.18 (no specific formulas, no mandated evidence type) comes from the principle of separation of concerns. The kernel should provide the _what_ and _how (structurally)_, while architheories provide the _how (procedurally)_. This keeps the kernel lean (**P‑1 Cognitive Elegance**) and allows domain experts to implement whatever method is appropriate, merely committing to wrap their results in the CSLC form. By doing so, we avoid any bias toward empirical vs analytical, or manual vs automated measurements – FPF welcomes all, as long as they conform to the schema. This was rationalized by examining case studies: e.g., some reliability metrics come from formal proofs (analysis), others from testing (empirical) – the kernel can host both results identically, requiring only that each result says what it measured and on what scale.
    

In essence, A.18 is the _infrastructure of meaning_ for metrics. It may appear as a simple template, but it’s profoundly enabling. It forces clarity at creation time, so we don’t have to infer or debate meaning at usage time. The pattern’s strength lies in preventing errors that _don’t have to happen_. It encodes lessons from both metrology (the science of measurement) and everyday data science (where unit errors and mis-comparisons are infamous issues). The rationale is backed by these lessons: **fix the interpretation rules in the design, and you eliminate entire classes of confusion and mistakes.** By having this in the kernel, every architheory – from knowledge scoring to system performance – benefits immediately, and their results become interoperable to a degree that would be impossible without a common structure.

### 10\. Relations

-   **Extends/Uses:** **A.17 (CHR-NORM)** – A.18 explicitly builds on the canonical terminology established in A.17. It uses the term **Characteristic** as defined there (and no other synonyms) and carries forward the edict that “axis/dimension” be treated as mere narrative aliases. It also leverages the Entity-vs-Relation Characteristic distinction from A.17: Section 7.4 of this pattern references tests for disambiguating relational metrics. Essentially, A.17 provides the **lexical and conceptual groundwork** (what a Characteristic is, and the basic vocabulary), while A.18 provides the **structural and normative rules** for linking Characteristics to measurements.
    
-   **Core foundation for metrics:** This pattern underpins the **Measurement & Metrics Characterization spec (C.MM‑CHR)** – the architheory that implements metric storage and computation. In MM-CHR, every `U.MetricTemplate` and `U.Measure` follows the CSLC format defined by A.18. By lifting CSLC rules to the kernel, we ensure all architheories (like **KD-CAL** for knowledge dynamics, **Sys-CAL** for systems, or any custom CAL/CHR) share a common approach to metrics. A.18 also informs the design of **CHR-CAL (Characterisation Calculus)**, which generalizes measurable property templates: CHR-CAL relies on the one-Characteristic-per-metric assumption and the comparability rules set here to compose higher-level characterizations.
    
-   **Enables dynamic reasoning:** A.18’s insistence on well-defined Scales allows patterns like **A.3.3 `U.Dynamics`** (system dynamics models) to incorporate measurement dimensions as state variables without ambiguity. For example, a `stateSpace` in a dynamics model can be explicitly defined as a set of Characteristics (each with units and ranges), making simulations and traces dimensionally consistent. If A.18 were not in place, one model might treat “performance” as a 1–5 score and another as a probability – combining them would be incoherent. With A.18, such differences must be reconciled via a Gauge or kept separate, preserving coherence in multi-model analyses.
    
-   **Coordinates with assurance patterns:** Many patterns in Part B and D (for trust, assurance, and ethics) involve **scores** and **metrics**. For instance, **B.3** (Assurance Levels) computes overall assurance from evidence scores; A.18 ensures those input scores are well-defined and comparable (e.g. all are 0–1 or all are percentages, with polarity noted). **D.4** (Trust-Aware Calculus) might combine trust metrics across domains – again, A.18 provides the common ground so that a “trust score” coming from an operational metric and one coming from a social rating can be normalized and compared meaningfully. In summary, any pattern that aggregates or uses measurements is constrained (in a positive way) by A.18’s rules. They “plug into” this framework.
    
-   **Constrained by lexical rules:** This pattern’s content is part of the formal lexicon governance. It works within **E.10 LEX-BUNDLE**, which means the terms _Characteristic, Scale, Coordinate, Level,_ etc., are controlled vocabulary. A.18 localizes some generic requirements from A.17 (for example, A.17 mandates polarity in principle; A.18 requires it be declared per template in practice). It also aligns with external standards: by having explicit scale types and units, it dovetails with ISO/IEC measurement terminology and allows straightforward mapping to frameworks like **ISO 80000 (quantities and units)** and **Stevens’s scale types**. This relation to standards is deliberate – it eases **F.9 (Alignment Bridge)** construction to external ontologies by having a clean internal schema (A.18 provides that schema). In effect, A.18 is where FPF’s internal consistency meets external compatibility, ensuring our measurement semantics can relate to those outside FPF when needed.

## A.19 (A.CHR‑SPACE) — CharacteristicSpace & Dynamics Hook `[A]`

**Status.** _Normative architectural pattern._  
**Non‑duplication note.** This pattern reuses the canonical measurement concepts (`U.Characteristic`, **CSLC** terms) defined in **A.17 (CHR‑NORM)** and **A.18 (CSLC‑KERNEL)**, and it relies on the measurement & metrics architheory **C.16 (MM‑CHR)** for gauges and evidence handling. It **does not redefine** those concepts, nor does it introduce any new measurement units or gauge semantics. It also does not specify dynamic laws or timebases (see **A.3.3**); it only establishes the **state-space construct** that `U.Dynamics` will consume.

---

### 1 · Intent & Scope (Normative)

**Intent.** Establish a **kernel-level state carrier**—`U.CharacteristicSpace`—so that any holon’s **state changes** (whether in a system’s condition, an epistemic artifact’s status, a role’s readiness, etc.) can be formalized as **trajectories in a space of declared Characteristics with chosen Scales**. In other words, evolution is modeled as motion through a well-defined multi-Characteristic space rather than as ad-hoc lifecycle stages. This gives every `U.Dynamics` model a well-typed `stateSpace` and enables formal state certification (using RoleStateGraph checklists) instead of narrative stage transitions.

**Scope.** Pattern A.19 **defines**:

-   the **type** `U.CharacteristicSpace` as a finite product of **scale carriers** (per A.18),
    
-   the **slot** construct for each factor (a pairing of a **Characteristic** with a chosen **Scale**),
    
-   minimal **structural overlays** (optional **order**, **topology**, **metric** hooks) that downstream architheories _may_ attach to a space, and
    
-   the **hook** `U.Dynamics.stateSpace : CharacteristicSpace` – i.e. the requirement that any dynamics model declare a CharacteristicSpace for its state space (typing only).
    

A.19 **does not** introduce any new measurement aspects, composite metrics, or gauge definitions (those are provided by **C.16 MM‑CHR**), and it does not define how dynamics evolve over time or any predictive laws (see **A.3.3** for dynamics semantics). The focus here is purely on the _structure of state spaces_ and their comparability.

---

### 2 · Context (Informative)

FPF’s kernel already standardizes **what** is measured (a **Characteristic**, per A.17) and **how** it is measured (a **Scale** with units, via the **CSLC** contract in A.18). We also have a measurement substrate (`U.MetricTemplate`, `U.Measure`) to handle individual observations. What has been missing for modeling **dynamics** is a canonical “Context” in which **multiple Characteristics** can co-exist so that complex **states** (with many aspects) and their **trajectories** are well-typed and comparable. Without a formal CharacteristicSpace, teams either hard-code ad-hoc vectors (often with inconsistent assumptions) or fall back to informal lifecycle stories (“phases” or stages) that contradict the kernel’s open-ended, non-linear evolution paradigm. The Architectural patterns (A-cluster) expect that `U.Dynamics.stateSpace` will be a set of **declared Characteristics each with a declared Scale**. Pattern A.19 delivers exactly this capability, leveraging the CSLC measurement discipline without reinventing any arithmetic or unit-handling logic.

---

### 3 · Problem (Informative)

-   **P1 — “Feature vector” drift.** In practice, teams often assemble state vectors or “feature” lists with implicit or mismatched units and scales. Without a formal space, one coordinate’s value can’t safely be compared or combined with another’s (e.g. mixing degrees Celsius with percentages). **CSLC** guarantees consistency **per Characteristic**, but a bundle of multiple “characteristics” remains under-specified if we lack a unified space definition.
    
-   **P2 — Lifecycle bias.** Absent a formal state space, system change tends to be described in terms of fixed **stages or phases** (design phases, maturity levels, etc.). This conflicts with FPF’s **open-ended** stance: in FPF a role’s state model (RSG) allows re-entry and refinement of states rather than one-way lifecycle stages with an “end.” We need a space model that treats evolution as continuous movement, not a one-directional sequence.
    
-   **P3 — Incoherence across CG‑frames.** Different modeling “CG‑frames” (architecture vs. epistemic vs. operational) often choose different sets of qualities to measure (different sets of characteristics). Later, however, we may need to **compose** these models or **project** one into another. Without a kernel notion of how one state space can be a **subspace** of or **embedded** in another, any integration of models will be ad hoc and error-prone.
    
-   **P4 — Relational measurements.** Some Characteristics are inherently **relational** (e.g. a _Coupling_ between two components, or _Distance_ between points). Naïvely forcing such traits into a single-object feature vector loses critical information (arity, symmetry). The kernel already distinguishes single-entity vs multi-entity Characteristics (A.17); we must preserve that distinction in the state space so that a relational metric isn’t treated as an intrinsic one by mistake.
    
-   **P5 — The geometry temptation.** When defining a state space, it’s tempting to assume or inject additional structure (ordering of states, topologies for continuity, metrics for distance) as if inherent. But the kernel must remain minimal and domain-neutral: it should not **smuggle in** analysis methods or domain-specific norms under the guise of geometry. Any such structure should be added explicitly by specialized architheories, not baked into the core definition of a space.
    

---

### 4 · Forces (Informative)

-   **F1 – CSLC integrity at scale.** When combining multiple measurements into a state, we must uphold the **CSLC discipline** for each component: each coordinate has a defined Characteristic, Scale type, unit, and (if applicable) polarity. We need to do this without redefining or duplicating that single-characteristic integrity – the multi-dimensional space should simply enforce CSLC per slot.
    
-   **F2 – Transdisciplinarity & lexical clarity.** The state space framework must work for **quantitative physical metrics** (ratio scales, continuous units), **qualitative assessments** (ordinal scales, tiers), and mixtures thereof. It must not be biased toward one domain’s notion of measurement. At the same time, to avoid confusion, the **lexicon must remain canonical**: we use _Characteristic_ (not “axis/dimension”) as the formal term for a measured aspect, regardless of domain, per A.17’s naming convention.
    
-   **F3 – Arity and semantics.** Lifting various Characteristics into a unified space should not obscure their nature. If a Characteristic is defined as a relation (multi-entity property), the state space must represent it appropriately (e.g. as a coordinate that is a tuple or a symmetric relation) rather than flattening it into an unrelated scalar. Entity-specific vs relational properties must remain clear in the space’s structure.
    
-   **F4 – Minimal core, extensible further.** The kernel should provide only the **bare essentials**: a carrier for state with proper typing. It should be possible to impose additional structure like order, topology, or metrics _if and when needed_ by downstream theories, but these must be **optional overlays**. The core space definition should be minimalistic to allow broad use, yet capable of extension for advanced needs.
    
-   **F5 – Composability of spaces.** We need well-defined operations to **project** a state space to a subspace (dropping some Characteristics), **embed** one space into a larger space (mapping coordinates from one context to another), and take **products** of spaces (combining different state spaces into a joint space). These operations are crucial for composing sub-models, comparing alternatives, or aligning different “CG‑frames” (for example, linking an architectural model’s state space with a metrics model’s space). The approach must support such composition in a principled way.
    
-   **F6 – Alignment with RSG (state machines).** In FPF, formal **state certification** is done via checklists on RoleStateGraphs (A.2.5). Our state space concept must complement that: i.e. the **state** of a holon remains an **intensional** concept (defined by criteria), but those criteria are evaluated against the measurable **coordinates** in a CharacteristicSpace. The design must allow checklists to map observed coordinates to named states and enable re-certification as states evolve, rather than locking states into a static progression.

### 5 · Solution

#### 5.1 `U.CharacteristicSpace`

##### 5.1.1 Type signature

Let **I** be a finite index set labeling a collection of **slots**. Each **slot** _i_ (for _i ∈ I_) is defined as a pair:

> **`slot_i = (Characteristic_i, Scale_i)`**,

where:

-   `Characteristic_i` is a `U.Characteristic` (with an explicit arity, i.e. either an entity-Characteristic or a relation-Characteristic as defined in A.17), and
    
-   `Scale_i` is a chosen **Scale** for that Characteristic (with a specified scale type and unit, per A.18 and the MM‑CHR rules).
    

Then a **CharacteristicSpace** (CS) is formally the Cartesian product of all slot carriers:

$$\mathbf{CS} = \prod_{i \in I} \mathrm{Carrier}(\mathrm{slot}_i)\,.$$

In other words, a point (state) in the space consists of one coordinate value for each slot. A **state** _x_ in CS can be seen as a total function _x(i)_ that picks a value from each slot’s carrier (for every _i ∈ I_, _x(i) ∈ Carrier(slot\_i)_). By kernel mandate, any `U.Dynamics.stateSpace` **SHALL** be bound to some instance of `CharacteristicSpace`, and all states or trajectories described by that dynamics model **MUST** lie within that space’s carrier set. (The actual dynamic **laws** and time progression are handled in A.3.3; A.19 only defines the state-space container and its properties.)

##### 5.1.2 Slot discipline (invariants)

To ensure consistency and comparability, a CharacteristicSpace must obey the following invariants:

-   **A19-CS-1 (Exactly one per slot).** Each slot **binds exactly one** Characteristic to **exactly one** Scale (including a specific Unit or kind, if applicable). This mirrors the CSLC clause of “one aspect – one scale”: there are no ambiguous or compound mappings in a single slot. (If a Characteristic can be measured on multiple scales, only one is chosen for a given space; others would require separate slots or a different space.)
    
-   **A19-CS-2 (Named basis).** A CharacteristicSpace **SHALL** publish an ordered list of its slots as its **basis**. Each slot in the basis has a stable identifier (or key) that can be used in data structures or APIs. These basis names should be treated as technical identifiers (machine-readable tokens); any human-friendly alias or description for a slot should be provided only in the Plain register as a non-normative aid (per E.10). In short, the identity and order of slots in the space are explicit and stable.
    
-   **A19-CS-3 (Immutability of meaning).** Once a space is in use, the meaning of each slot is fixed. A slot’s `(Characteristic, Scale)` pair **MUST NOT** be retroactively altered. If requirements change (e.g. a different scale or a revised definition of the Characteristic), one **MUST** define a new version of the space (or a new slot) rather than silently changing the existing one. When a space is versioned or a slot replaced, an explicit **embedding** (mapping from the old space to the new space) should be published to relate historical states to the new coordinates. This ensures past data remains interpretable and prevents semantic drift.
    
-   **A19-CS-4 (Arity preservation).** If a `Characteristic_i` is defined as a **relation** (multi-entity characteristic), then slot _i_ represents a relationship among multiple entities. The coordinate value at such a slot is a **tuple** (with the appropriate entity types) rather than a simple scalar. The slot’s declaration **SHALL** indicate the relation’s symmetry or directionality as part of its meaning (this should align with how the Characteristic was originally defined in its template). In essence, relational Characteristics retain their arity in the space, so that we don’t confuse, say, “Coupling between X and Y” with an intrinsic property of X or Y alone.
    
-   **A19-CS-5 (No hidden gauges).** A CharacteristicSpace itself carries **no implicit gauges or formulas** for aggregating coordinates. It is a _descriptive_ structure, not a scoring mechanism. Any computation that combines or transforms coordinates (e.g. producing an overall “score” or weighted sum) must be defined outside the core space – typically in an architheory that leverages the measurement framework (see C.16’s gauge constructs **𝒢**). In particular, any handling of **polarity** (which way “better” is) or weighting of different **slots** happens in those external formulas, not inside the space definition. The space provides the raw coordinates; the logic to interpret or aggregate them is added by domain-specific layers with explicit disclosure of how it’s done.

 - **A19-CS-6 (Slot meta completeness).** Where applicable, each slot **SHALL** declare `admissible_domain` and **missingness semantics** (e.g., codes for *missing*, *censored*, *not-applicable*), consistent with the Characteristic’s Scale and with MM‑CHR. This prevents silent domain drift and clarifies how absent values participate in predicates and comparisons.

##### 5.1.3 Minimal structure hooks (optional overlays)

By default, a CharacteristicSpace has no assumed ordering or metric structure – it is just a Cartesian product of value sets. However, a space **MAY** declare certain structural attributes _as opt-in metadata_ (i.e. informative annotations that architheories can rely on, but not enforced by the kernel). These optional **overlays** include:

-   **Product order.** An **order** relation `≤_prod` on the space, typically induced coordinate-wise by orders on individual slots _that are ordinal or higher_. If some slots have an inherent order (e.g. a higher numeric reading means “more” of something), the space can declare that it uses the **product order**: one state ≤ another if and only if it is ≤ on each ordered slot (after aligning their “better direction”). This supports dominance or “no worse than” comparisons across multi-criteria states.
    
-   **Product topology.** A **topology** on the space, typically the product topology when slots that are quantitative (interval or ratio scales) need continuity considerations. Declaring a topology is useful if continuity or convergence arguments are relevant (e.g. to say a sequence of states approaches a limit state). By default, without declaration, no topological structure is assumed on the space.
    
-   **Metric.** A **distance function** `d` on the space, if some architheory defines one. For example, an architheory might introduce a specific metric like a weighted Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance on normalized coordinates. If a metric is provided, its formula and any weighting or normalization factors **MUST** be explicitly published as part of the space’s definition (no implicit “obvious” distances – everything must be stated).
    
    _Lexical note:_ Here **“metric”** strictly means a mathematical distance function (or a generalized distance like a pre-order or semi-metric) on the state space. This is **not** to be confused with the term “metric” in the sense of a performance metric or measure in MM‑CHR. In this document, _Metric_ (capitalized) usually refers to `U.MetricTemplate` (the template for a measured value), whereas a _metric function_ (lowercase) refers to a distance formula. Any distance overlay on a CharacteristicSpace must not conflict with the semantic measurements of scales; it’s an additional structure for analysis, not a redefinition of the underlying measurement.
    

These overlays are entirely **optional** and have no effect on the core meaning of the space – they exist only to support particular needs (like making **dominance**, **continuity**, or **distance** reasoning possible) in models that require them. If needed, they should be added deliberately by an architectural theory rather than assumed. This way, any ordering or metric properties of states are made **explicit** instead of relying on hidden or default arithmetic. _(Rationale:_ The CSLC and MM‑CHR rules already govern what operations are allowed on each scale; A.19’s approach is to let higher-level theories layer on an order, topology, or metric when appropriate, so nothing is taken for granted tacitly in multi-dimensional arithmetic._)_

##### 5.1.4 Dynamics hook (typing only)

Any model of change or dynamics in FPF must declare the state space it operates over. Formally, `U.Dynamics.stateSpace` **SHALL** be specified as a reference to a `CharacteristicSpace`. This creates a typing obligation: the dynamic model can only produce states (and trajectories of states) that lie in the given space. All predicates or predictions in such a dynamics model are understood to **quantify over** sequences of points in that CharacteristicSpace (with time semantics governed by A.3.3’s time base and laws). **Note:** A.19 defines only the structure of the state space; it deliberately **does not** fix any time axis or dynamic law. Those remain the responsibility of the dynamics pattern (A.3.3). A.19 simply ensures there is a well-defined space in which states live, so that dynamics are decoupled from any narrative “stage” and instead treat evolution as movement through this space.

##### 5.1.5 Lexical discipline (Normative)

In all **normative references, definitions, and identifiers** related to this pattern, the specification uses the canonical measurement terminology: **Characteristic**, **Scale**, **Level**, **Coordinate**, **CharacteristicSpace**, **slot**, **basis**. Legacy terms like “axis”, “dimension”, or “point” are **forbidden** in Technical/Formal registers of the spec (per A.17’s lexical rules). They may appear _at most once_ in explanatory **Plain** language as mapped aliases to aid understanding (and if used, must be explicitly identified as equivalent to the official terms). In this pattern, we consistently use “slot” or “basis element” (never “axis”) to refer to a component of a space, and “Characteristic” (never “dimension”) to refer to the measured aspect. This lexical discipline ensures clarity and consistency across the framework (see A.17 and C.16 L-rules for the formal policy on terminology).

##### 5.1.6 Quotients & Gauge‑fix (Normative)

**Design rule — read invariants, not labels.** Eligibility, comparability and acceptance **SHALL** be decided on **quotients** (or on explicitly **gauge‑fixed** charts), not on raw labels.

*Minimal obligations:*
1) **Name the quotient or fix.** If a checklist predicates over a gauge‑variant property, it **MUST** name the **gauge‑fix** (which normalization or chart is assumed).
2) **Declare gauge kind.** Any used gauge **MUST** be named in the Context’s glossary (e.g., affine unit conversion, monotone spline, LUT with uncertainty).
3) **Join/equality only on invariants.** Equality checks and joins across spaces **MUST** target invariant forms (quotient or declared gauge‑fixed representation), never raw un‑fixed coordinates.

##### 5.1.7 Metric discipline & calibration (Normative)

Use the **weakest safe structure** required by the argument (pre‑order → semi‑metric → metric). Any acceptance predicate or KPI defined over a CharacteristicSpace **SHALL be non‑expansive** (Lipschitz ≤ 1) under the declared normalization, or else state an explicit margin that absorbs expansion.

*Minimal obligations:*
1) **Coordinate declaration.** Every numeric coordinate declares scale‑type, unit and polarity (reuse A.18/ C.16); categorical/ordinal declare admissible order if used.
2) **Distance with bounds.** Any distance used in acceptance/state tests **MUST** carry max tolerated error and (where claimed) a **Lipschitz bound** w.r.t. the referenced normalization.
3) **Calibration trace.** Cross‑CG‑frame inputs **SHALL** name the calibration transform (affine / monotone mapping / LUT) and its **validity window** (range and dates), with trace to carriers.

#### 5.2 State Spaces & Comparability

> **Memory hook:** _We compare **only what lies in the same space** (or is translated into a common space via a declared mapping), and we only certify a holon’s **state** based on **observable coordinates** in that space (using a defined checklist). Anything else is just storytelling._

To make state-space reasoning practical across different contexts and models, this section provides the key **operators and criteria** related to CharacteristicSpaces:

1.  **Space operations** – how to derive a **Subspace**, establish an **Embedding**, or form a **Product** of spaces. These enable us to restrict a space to fewer slots, to map one space into another (with unit conversions, etc.), or to combine spaces (e.g. for composite models).
    
2.  **Comparability regimes** – two allowable ways to compare states: (a) **coordinatewise**, which requires strict sameness of space and units; or (b) **gauge-based**, which uses declared transformations to reconcile differences. We define when each applies and how to apply it properly.
    
3.  **RSG integration** – how formal **state certification** (via checklists in a Role’s state graph) ties into the CharacteristicSpace: ensuring that whenever we declare a system “Ready” or “Degraded”, it’s based on snapshot coordinates in a space. We also outline how to push or pull state definitions along space embeddings (so different contexts can translate states).
    
4.  **Archetypal examples** – “worked mini-schemas” illustrating typical usage in complementary CG‑frames (Operational, Assurance, Alignment). These examples show minimal models mixing entity and relational slots, how data might be structured, and how cross-context alignment works in practice.
    

> **Terminology note:** We often denote a CharacteristicSpace abstractly as **CS**. Formally, one can describe a CS as a tuple `⟨I, basis⟩` where _I_ is the index set of slots and _basis_ is the set (or ordered list) of `slot_i` pairs. When a CharacteristicSpace is attached to a specific **Role** in a specific **Context** (see A.2, A.2.5), we may call it an **RCS** (Role CharacteristicSpace) – essentially the state space for that role’s state machine within that bounded context. Individual **states** of a role live in an RSG (RoleStateGraph, A.2.5), and a **StateAssertion** is a certified claim that at a given time window, the holon’s RCS coordinates satisfy the checklist for a particular state.

##### 5.2.1 · CS Operators (notation-neutral, context-local)

To support model composition, we define operations on CharacteristicSpaces in a notation-independent way (so these can be implemented in any tooling or notation). All these operations are assumed to occur **within a single context** (within one `U.BoundedContext`) unless otherwise noted:

**5.2.1.1 Subspace –** **Projection** `π_S : CS → CS|_S`.  
Given a CharacteristicSpace CS with basis _I_ (slots) and a chosen subset of slot indices $S \\subseteq I$, one can form the **subspace** $CS|\_S$ which includes only the slots in _S_ and omits all others. The projection map `π_S` takes any state _x_ in the original space and **projects** it onto the coordinates indexed by _S_, effectively discarding the other coordinates.  This operation is straightforward: if $S = {i\_1, i\_2, ...}$, then $CS|\_S `has those slots and any state in $CS|_S$ corresponds to a state in CS with the other coordinates ignored. **Properties:** Projection is **idempotent** (`π\_S ∘ π\_S = π\_S`) and, if an order or other structure is defined solely on the subspace’s slots,` π\_S\` preserves that structure (e.g. it will reflect any order that depends only on slots in _S_).

**5.2.1.2 Embedding –** **Injection** `ι : CS₁ ↪ CS₂`.  
An **embedding** is a structure-preserving **injection** from one space CS₁ into another space CS₂. It consists of two parts: (a) a mapping of slots from CS₁ to slots of CS₂, and (b) for each such slot, a **gauge** function that translates coordinates from CS₁’s scale into CS₂’s scale (when the scales or units differ). Formally, let CS₁ have basis _I₁_ and CS₂ have _I₂_. An embedding defines an injective function _m: I₁ → I₂_ that identifies each slot of CS₁ with a corresponding slot in CS₂. For each slot _i ∈ I₁_, where its scale or unit differs from the target _m(i)_ in CS₂, we provide a **gauge** function $g\_i: Carrier(slot\_i) → Carrier(m(i))$ that is **monotonic** and respects the scale types (e.g. converting degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius, or mapping one ordinal ranking to another). Intuitively, an embedding says: “Any coordinate tuple from CS₁ can be interpreted as a coordinate tuple in CS₂, possibly after converting units or re-scaling, and without losing any information except what the declared gauges intentionally sacrifice.” If there is no loss at all (gauges are lossless identity or strict conversions), the embedding is essentially an inclusion of one space into a larger one; if there is some information loss (e.g. converting a fine-grained scale to a coarse one), that loss is explicit in the gauges. **Locality:** Embeddings are defined **within a single `U.BoundedContext`** (i.e. both CS₁ and CS₂ are in the same context). Using an embedding across contexts requires an **Alignment Bridge** (see F.9) with an associated congruence-loss policy. **Gauge declaration duties (MUST):** Each gauge **MUST** (i) state **monotonicity** w.r.t. the slot’s polarity; (ii) publish a **validity window** (value range and time applicability); and (iii) identify its transform class (affine / order‑preserving mapping / LUT with uncertainty). Gauges used in enactment gates **MUST** be *currently valid*; expired gauges require either renewal or an explicit Waiver (see C.16). In other words, you cannot assume one context’s space fits into another’s without an explicit Bridge; any attempt to do so must treat it as a cross-context alignment with potential loss.

**5.2.1.3 Product –** **Combination** `CS₁ ⊗ CS₂ = CS⊗`.  
The **product** of two spaces CS₁ and CS₂ is a new space **CS⊗** that effectively contains all slots of CS₁ and all slots of CS₂. If CS₁ has index set _I₁_ and basis slots {slot₁…} and CS₂ has _I₂_, then $CS⊗$ has index set $I\_⊗ = I₁ ⊎ I₂$ (disjoint union) with each slot’s definition carried over from its original space. In practical terms, any state in the product space is a pair _(x₁, x₂)_ where _x₁_ is a state of CS₁ and _x₂_ is a state of CS₂ (assuming the two spaces pertain to possibly different aspects or roles). **Use cases:** Product spaces allow modeling **multi-role scenarios** or bundling an entity’s state with some environmental or contextual state. For example, one might take a space of internal capability metrics and ⊗ with a space of external conditions to form a combined space for “readiness under conditions.” **Note:** When combining scores or coordinates from a product space (e.g. summing or aggregating values across all slots), one must be mindful of scale incommensurability. Typically, any cross-slot aggregation should go through a defined gauge or weighting/accumulation scheme (see B.1; `Fold_Γ`) rather than naïvely adding apples and oranges. The product operation itself doesn’t perform any aggregation; it just sets the stage for joint consideration of multiple factors.

##### 5.2.2 · Comparability of **States** (two admissible regimes)

A **state label** like "Ready", "Authorized", "Degraded", etc., in an RSG is an intensional category (defined by a checklist of conditions – see A.2.5). Determining whether the **states of two holons** are comparable (e.g. whether one is “better” or “worse” than the other in some multi-criteria sense) depends on **where** their state coordinates live and **how** we map those coordinates to a common basis. There are two admissible comparability regimes in FPF:

###### 5.2.2.1 Coordinatewise comparability (`≼_coord`)

Two states can be compared **coordinatewise** only under strict conditions. Essentially, we require the states to be expressed in the **same measurement space**, with the **same units and scales**, and using the **same state definitions**. Formally, coordinatewise comparison is allowed **only if all of the following hold**:

-   **Same space.** The two holders’ state snapshots lie in the **exact same CharacteristicSpace** (and, if relevant, the same RCS attached to a Role in a given Context). It’s not enough that they have similarly named characteristics; they must share the actual defined space (same slots with same definitions).
    
-   **Scale congruence.** For each slot being compared, the scale type, unit, and polarity orientation are **identical**. For example, if comparing temperature readings, both must be on the same scale (say, °C on a ratio scale with “higher = hotter” orientation). No unit mismatches or differing interpretations can be present.
    
-   **State-definition congruence.** The states or status labels themselves must be defined in terms of the **same checklist criteria applied in the same space**. In other words, if we are comparing whether one system is “Ready” and another is “Ready”, both instances of “Ready” must derive from the same formal definition (same thresholds, same checklist logic) over those coordinates. If one context’s "Ready" means something different, you cannot assume they correspond.
    

When these conditions are met, one can define a **coordinatewise preorder** over states. Common patterns include:

- **Dominance:** For a given set of “higher is better” slots, we say state *x* **≼<sub>coord</sub>** state *y* if and only if for *every relevant slot a*, the coordinate $a(x) \le a(y)$ (**after orienting all slots to the declared polarity for that slot**). In other words, *y* is as good or better on all enforced criteria. This defines a Pareto-like ordering (often partial, not total).

-   **Threshold band inclusion:** If states are defined by meeting certain thresholds (e.g. State _Y_ means all metrics above specific levels), then we might say _x_ **≼<sub>coord</sub>** _y_ if _x_ meets every threshold that defines _y_’s state. For instance, if state _y_ = “High Performance” requires speed > 100 and accuracy > 90%, then _x_ is “no less than y” if _x_ also exceeds those thresholds.
    
By default, **no comparability** is assumed unless proven. If any of the above congruence conditions fails, one must **not** fall back to ad-hoc comparisons (like matching by name or normalizing without declaration). Either switch to a **gauge-based regime** or declare the states **incomparable**.

###### 5.2.2.2 Gauge‑based comparability (`≼_gauge`)

When two state vectors do not meet the strict conditions for coordinatewise comparison (e.g. they come from different spaces, or same conceptual Characteristics but measured on different scales/units, or defined in different contexts), the only sanctioned way to compare them is via a **gauge-based mapping** into a common space. The idea is: **map, then compare**. Specifically:

If we have state _x_ in space CS₁ and state _y_ in space CS₂ (possibly the same space, possibly not), and if direct coordinatewise comparison is not valid, we must introduce a set of **per-slot gauge functions** to translate one state’s coordinates into the frame of the other. A **gauge** `g_a: Dom(a_src) → Dom(a_tgt)` is a monotonic transformation (non-decreasing if higher means “more”) that converts values from the source slot’s domain to the target slot’s domain. Each gauge is tailored to its Characteristic/Scale pair, and it respects the scale type (e.g. an _affine_ linear conversion for interval/ratio scales, an _order-preserving_ mapping for ordinal scales, or a categorical re-mapping for nominal scales). Collectively, a set of gauges ${g\_a}$ for all slots forms a **vector mapping** $G: CS\_1 → CS\_2$ (conceptually $G = \\bigoplus\_a g\_a$) which constitutes an **embedding** of CS₁ into CS₂ (as defined earlier in §5.2.1.2). Any loss or approximation incurred by these mappings should be explicitly understood (e.g. rounding, unit precision, information dropped).

**Comparability rule (gauge-based).** We say _x_ **≼<sub>gauge</sub>** _y_ if, after applying the gauge map $G$ to _x_ to translate it into space CS₂, the resulting point $G(x)$ is **≼<sub>coord</sub>** _y_ in the target space. In other words, we don’t compare _x_ and _y_ directly; we compare _G(x)_ to _y_, where _G(x)_ and _y_ are now expressed in the **same** space (CS₂) with the same units and definitions. Gauge-based comparison thus reduces to the coordinatewise case _after_ a transformation.

If the gauge mapping crosses context boundaries (i.e. CS₁ and CS₂ are in different bounded contexts), then by FPF policy this mapping must be treated as a formal **Bridge** alignment with an associated **congruence-loss (CL)** level. In such cases, any conclusions drawn carry an **assurance penalty**: the confidence in comparability is discounted according to the worst-case loss of meaning along the mapping. (See also B.3’s `Φ(CL)` rule for how a CL penalty factors into trustworthiness scores.)

**Auditability.** Each gauge function should be fully specified and transparent. At minimum, one should document the functional form or mapping table being used and the intended domain of validity. In the measurement architheory (C.16), any gauge would come with evidence of calibration or rationale for the mapping, and a note of its valid range or conditions. (For example, a gauge translating lab scores to field scores might note it’s valid only for a certain operating range.) While A.19 does not require recording these details, it assumes that such **evidence and bounds** are handled by the metric/gauge framework (MM‑CHR) outside the core space definition. The key here is that **no comparison is magic** – if values differ in scale or context, a declared monotonic transformation must bridge them, and its limitations should be known.

> **Mnemonic:** _“Never compare before you **land** both points in the **same** well-typed space.”_ In other words, always map measurements to a common basis (same CharacteristicSpace and units) before attempting to say one state is ≥ or ≤ another. Directly comparing raw numbers from different scales or contexts is not allowed.

##### 5.2.3 · RSG touch-points — **State certification via CS**

To connect the abstract concept of a **space of metrics** with the operational concept of **states** (like “Ready” or “Degraded”) in a Role’s lifecycle, we introduce a **certifier** function that evaluates state predicates against coordinates: 

certify(Role, Context): Snapshot( RCS[Role,Context], Window )  ──→  {StateAssertion}

This is a conceptual sketch: given a **snapshot** of all relevant coordinates for a Role (in its RCS) over some time window, the certifier produces a set of **StateAssertions** that are deemed true in that window. Each StateAssertion claims that the holder is in a particular state (e.g. “Ready”) during the window, backed by evidence.

**5.2.3.1 From CS snapshot to StateAssertion (design → run).** Each possible state _s_ in a Role’s RSG has an associated **Checklist** _(s)_ – a design-time artifact (see A.2.5 §8.1) which is a predicate defined over the RCS’s coordinates (and possibly other contextual observables). For example, a state “Degraded” might have a checklist like “\[temperature < 50 °C\] AND \[pressure > 5 bar\] for 10 minutes”. When the system is running, we take an **Observation** of the current coordinates (a snapshot of the RCS at a given time or over a time window) and evaluate the checklist. A **StateAssertion**(holder, _s_, Window) is then a record that the checklist for state _s_ has been satisfied by the observed data in that interval. In other words, it’s a certified evaluation that “state _s_ holds true for this holon at this time.” Only observable, measurable facts go into these predicates (no subjective judgments), and each assertion is traceable to the specific evidence (observations) that support it. The Role’s **Green-Gate Law** (A.2.5 §8.4) then says that a Role can proceed with an enactment (e.g. performing work) if and only if there is a **StateAssertion** showing the holon to be in an **enactable** state at that time. This connects measurement to action: you can only act if you have evidence you’re in the right state to act. **Evidence kind & window.** Every StateAssertion **SHALL** record `evidence_kind ∈ {observation, prediction}`, the **window** `[t_from, t_to]`, and, if `prediction`, the **horizon Δt** relative to the observation base. Use of `prediction` in enactment gates is permitted **only** under the DYN/TIME constraints in § 5.2.6; otherwise a **fresh observation** is required.

**5.2.3.2 Translating state definitions across embeddings.** If we have an **embedding** ι: RCS₁ ↪ RCS₂ (for example, RCS₁ is a subspace or a different version of RCS₂), we might want to reuse or compare state definitions between the two. There are two directions to consider:

-   **Pulling a checklist** (reuse state criteria from a larger space in a smaller space): Given a checklist defined on RCS₂ (the larger or target space), we can **pull it back** via the gauge map _G_ of the embedding to get a predicate on RCS₁. This derived checklist (Checklist₂ ∘ G) lets us apply the RCS₂’s state definition to a holon that only has RCS₁ measurements. This is useful when a consumer context wants to evaluate whether a producer (with fewer characteristics or different units) meets the consumer’s state definitions. Essentially, the consumer asks: “If I map the producer’s metrics into my space, does it satisfy my state criteria _s_?”
    
-   **Pushing an assertion** (honor a producer’s certified state in a larger space): If a holon has a StateAssertion for state s’ in RCS₁, can we treat it as evidence for state s in RCS₂? This is only valid under a strict condition: the checklist for state s in the larger space, when composed with the gauge mapping G, must logically imply the checklist s’ in the smaller space (or vice versa, depending on which state corresponds to which). In practice, this often requires a proof of refinement: that meeting state s (in big space) guarantees state s’ (in small space), or that state s’ (in small) is sufficient for state s (in big) given the gauge translations. If that condition is met (or a policy waiver is granted in lieu of proof), then an assertion in the smaller space can be **pushed up** to count as an assertion in the larger space. This mechanism allows, for example, a component’s certified state to satisfy a system-level state requirement, provided the relationship is formally established.
  
  **5.2.3.3 Certification interface (pointer).** Operational interface examples and minimal data stubs are **informative** and live in **A.19.D1 §14** (“Certification Interface Example”). Pattern A.19 only constrains **conceptual** obligations; no storage/ID scheme is mandated here.
  
_(In summary, embeddings not only allow numeric comparability, but also allow **state definitions** and **certifications** to be systematically translated between contexts, ensuring consistency in how we interpret “Ready”, “Failed”, etc., across different models.)_

##### 5.2.4 · Cross-context comparability & assurance hooks

When comparing states or metrics **across different bounded contexts** (different “context of meaning”), additional rules apply to maintain semantic integrity:

-   **5.2.4.1 Direction & loss (Bridges).** Suppose we want to claim that “Holon X in Context B is in state _Ready_ as defined in Context A.” This requires an explicit **Alignment Bridge** declaration that maps the RCS of _(Role, Context B)_ to the RCS of _(Role, Context A)_ (or maps State B to State A). Such a Bridge (see F.9) will specify the correspondence of Characteristics (and the necessary gauge functions) and a **congruence-loss (CL)** level indicating how much fidelity is lost in translation. Critically, these Bridges are **one-directional** mappings unless explicitly made bidirectional. Just because we can interpret B’s state as an A-state does not mean we can go the other way without another mapping. The Bridge makes the mapping and any loss explicit. Without a declared Bridge, cross-context state comparisons or substitutions are not valid – there is no implicit global state space. The statement above, for instance, would only hold if we have something like “Bridge B→A (with defined gauges) such that X@B can be viewed in A’s terms.” The **direction matters**: “B satisfies A’s Ready” does **not** imply the converse unless another bridge (A→B) is defined.
    
-   **5.2.4.2 Confidence penalties for mapped comparisons.** Whenever a **gauge-based comparison** is done across contexts (i.e. via a Bridge), any **assurance or confidence** we have in the equivalence is reduced in proportion to the mapping’s information loss. In formal terms, if an assertion or comparison crosses a Bridge with congruence-loss CL = 1, 2, or 3 (on a scale where 0 means no loss, 3 means high loss), then per assurance model (B.3) we apply a penalty factor Φ(CL) to any claims of confidence or compliance. For example, a safety argument that relies on a cross-context comparison might need to downgrade its certainty or include an extra safety margin.  This penalty **MUST** be declared as part of the assurance argument for the comparison (stating the Bridge used and its CL), so that the Φ(CL) discount can be reasoned and applied. No implementation‑level storage format or identifier is mandated by this pattern.
    
-   **5.2.4.3 Declare “incomparable” when appropriate.** If for some critical Characteristic there is **no valid gauge** to translate measurements between two contexts (e.g. the scale types are fundamentally different, or the measurement’s meaning doesn’t carry over), then the framework insists that we declare the states or metrics **incomparable** rather than attempting any fudge. No comparison should ever default to “close enough by name” or other heuristics. For instance, if one context measures “User Satisfaction” qualitatively and another quantitatively, and no monotonic mapping can be justified, one must simply say a user satisfaction state in context A cannot be compared to one in context B. Mark it incomparable and avoid any misleading conclusions. This rule guards against the natural temptation to compare things just because they have the same label or general intent, when in fact their measurement basis is different.

##### 5.2.5 Certification pipeline (Minimal, Normative)

Canonical evaluation chain (notation‑neutral):

`raw coords → Normalize (κ) → Quotient / Gauge‑fix → (optional) Order/Distance overlay → Evaluate Checklist → StateAssertion → Green‑Gate`

+**Strict distinction.** Steps may be **co‑implemented**, but are **logically distinct** and **MUST** be referenceable in assertions (κ/gauge IDs, overlay kind). A gate is **invalid** if any required step lacks a current, valid referent (e.g., expired κ/gauge).

### 5.3 Operator library (notation‑neutral)

**Spaces:** `Sub` (projection), `Emb` (embedding), `Prod` (product), `Quot` (quotient by declared equivalence), `Fix_g` (gauge‑fix to named chart).

**States/criteria transport:** `Pull` (pull checklist via embedding/gauge), `Push` (push assertion along embedding with proof/waiver), `Align_B` (cross‑context alignment via Bridge with CL), `Fold_Γ` (admissible aggregation/accumulation per B.1, with WLNK/MONO constraints).

**OP‑1 (Normative).** If `Align_B` is used in **gating**, the **Bridge used** and its **CL** **MUST** be declared in the assurance argument; the corresponding Φ(CL) penalty is applied per B.3. Silent cross‑context reuse is forbidden. (A.19 does not mandate any storage/ID scheme.)

### 6 · Conformance Checklist (normative) — **CC‑A19**

**Formality anchors & operational segregation (normative).** A.19 aligns with **C.2.3 Unified Formality Characteristic (F)**. The legacy tier labels **T0/T1/T2 are deprecated**; speak **F** directly and treat operations separately (see **E.10** for registers).
— **F-Surface (recommended F ≥ F3).** Obligations are **declarability** and **arguability**: the author can **name** the CharacteristicSpace (basis/slots as *(Characteristic, Scale)* pairs), **state** the comparability regime (coordinatewise or gauge-based), and **express** a state’s checklist in observable coordinates. No storage formats, IDs, or operational provenance are required.
— **F-Predicates (F ≥ F4 when predicate-like).** As above, plus **explicit slot/gauge names** and **stated overlays** (order/metric). When acceptance conditions are written as **typed predicates over coordinates**, declare **F ≥ F4**. Remains **notation-neutral** and **storage-agnostic**.
— **Operational bindings (not part of F).** When automatic checking/assurance is required, use **A.19.D1 / C.16 / B.3** for IDs, validity windows, waivers, and logs. These raise **R/TA** in the trust calculus and **do not change F** unless the **expression form** changes (see C.2.3 orthogonality).

The following checklist summarizes the normative requirements introduced by Pattern A.19. An implementation or model **conforms** to A.19 if and only if all these conditions are met:

**Spaces & mappings**  
**CC‑A19.1.** Any defined **Subspace**, **Embedding**, or **Product** of CharacteristicSpaces **MUST** explicitly list the involved slots and their metadata (scale type, unit, polarity). No comparability or merging is allowed purely by matching names or assuming correspondence – it must be declared.  
**CC‑A19.2.** Every **Embedding** `ι: CS₁ ↦ CS₂` **MUST** provide a well-defined **gauge function** for each slot where `CS₁`’s slot differs in scale/unit from `CS₂`’s. Each gauge **MUST** (a) be **monotonic** w.r.t. the declared polarity and scale type; (b) publish a **validity window** (value range and time applicability); and (c) name its transform class (affine / order‑preserving / LUT). (Identity suffices where scales are identical.)

**Comparability**  
**CC‑A19.3.** **Coordinatewise comparability** (`≼_coord`) is **permitted only** when the states being compared share the **same CharacteristicSpace**, with **identical scale metadata** on each compared slot, and using the **same state definition criteria**. If these conditions aren’t fully satisfied, an implementation **MUST NOT** attempt direct coordinatewise comparison; it should either apply a gauge-based method or report the items as **incomparable**.  
**CC‑A19.4.** **Gauge‑based comparability** (`≼_gauge`) **MUST** be done by first mapping all relevant coordinates of the source state into the target state’s space via the declared gauges, and **only then** comparing in that common space. In other words, two states can be compared under `≼_gauge` only by producing an image of one in the other’s space (`G(x)`) and using `≼_coord` on the result. Each gauge’s transformation **MUST** be explicitly defined (no implicit or “on the fly” conversions).  
**CC‑A19.5.** Any cross-context state comparison or substitution **MUST** cite a corresponding **Alignment Bridge** (F.9) with an explicit **CL (congruence-loss) level**. If such a Bridge is used in an assurance or decision-making context, the model **MUST** apply the appropriate confidence reduction (`Φ(CL)` penalty per B.3) to reflect the loss. Cross-context comparisons without a Bridge (i.e. assuming equivalence by name or convention) are **forbidden**.

**Certification & enactment**  
**CC‑A19.6.** Every **StateAssertion** **MUST** identify at least: the specific **state** being asserted (by name), the associated **checklist** or criteria set (by name), and the observation **window**. Furthermore, if the evaluation involved cross‑space mapping, it **MUST** **declare** which **gauge(s)** or **Bridge** were applied. This ensures the decision can be examined in review; A.19 does not mandate any storage/ID scheme.

**CC‑A19.7.** The **Green-Gate enactment rule** (A.2.5) **SHALL** be enforced: a transformative action (`U.Work`) by a RoleAssignment is only allowed if there exists a **contemporaneous** StateAssertion showing the holon in a state that is marked **enactable**. If a StateAssertion has been translated from another context or space, it is valid for gating **only** if it was obtained through declared Embeddings/Bridges (no untracked inferences). This ensures no work is done under an unverified or mis-mapped state condition.  
**CC‑A19.8.** All **Checklist** definitions for states **MUST** be formulated in terms of **observable predicates** on the RCS (and known context events) – no hidden workflows or implicit time sequencing inside a checklist. A checklist should read like a static predicate (even if it’s about a duration of some condition). If temporal order or multi-step processes are involved in achieving a state, those must be modeled via explicit **Methods/Work** or via an aggregation logic (e.g., using the Γ (Gamma) patterns in B.1 for process sequencing), rather than being baked into the state’s definition.

**Anti‑drift**  
**CC‑A19.9.** If a **gauge** or a **state checklist** is updated or calibrated differently in a new version, previous StateAssertions **MUST NOT** be retroactively modified. One must close out or mark the old assertions with their valid time window and start issuing new assertions under the updated definitions. In other words, historical records remain as they were (tied to the definitions at that time), and any change in criteria results in a _new context or version_ for future assertions. This prevents retroactive truth-changing and maintains integrity of historical data.  
**CC‑A19.10.** If any **critical slot** in a comparison lacks a defensible monotonic gauge (meaning you cannot find any reasonable way to translate that characteristic between two spaces without excessive loss or ambiguity), then the comparison **MUST** be reported as **incomparable**. The system should not attempt any unofficial workaround (like simply comparing whatever is available or ignoring that dimension). This rule applies even if all other slots have gauges – one missing or irreconcilable aspect is enough to force an “incomparable” verdict, unless the decision-makers explicitly accept a loss via a Bridge with stated limitations.

**Quotients & Gauge‑fix (QNT)**
**CC‑A19.11.** Equality checks and joins across spaces **MUST** target invariant forms (on a **quotient** or declared **gauge‑fixed** chart), not raw coordinates.
**CC‑A19.12.** If a checklist predicates on a gauge‑variant property, it **MUST** name the **gauge‑fix** (which normalization/chart is assumed).
**CC‑A19.13.** All used gauge kinds (affine / monotone / LUT…) **MUST** be named in the bounded context’s glossary.

**Metric discipline & calibration (MET)**
**CC‑A19.14.** Acceptance predicates/KPIs over a CS **SHALL** be **non‑expansive** (Lipschitz ≤ 1) under the declared normalization, or declare a compensating margin.
**CC‑A19.15.** Any distance used in state/acceptance checks **MUST** carry max tolerated error and (where claimed) a **Lipschitz bound** for the normalization in use.
**CC‑A19.16.** Cross‑CG‑frame inputs **SHALL** name the **calibration transform** and its **validity window**; expired transforms are invalid for gating unless waived explicitly.

**Dynamics & time (DYN/TIME)**
**CC‑A19.17.** Every temporal guard **MUST** specify the window `[t_from, t_to]` and `evidence_kind ∈ {observation, prediction}`; if `prediction` is used for gating, § 5.2.6 conditions **MUST** hold.
**CC‑A19.18.** Any dynamics map `Φ_{Δt}` used in comparison/gating **MUST** be **non‑expansive** (Lipschitz ≤ 1) under the declared distance overlay **and** commute with `Quot/Fix_g`; otherwise **observation** is required.

**Certification (CERT)**
**CC‑A19.19.** StateAssertions **MUST** **state** the current κ/gauge/overlay artifacts used (by name or formula) and the `evidence_kind`; assertions relying on **expired** κ/gauge are **invalid** for gating unless an explicit **Waiver SpeechAct** is **declared** per policy. (A.19 imposes no requirement on IDs or storage.)

**CC‑A19.20.** The certification pipeline steps (Normalize κ; Quot/Fix_g; overlay; evaluate; assert) are **logically distinct** and **MUST** be reconstructable in argument/review; collapsing steps without clearly stated referents violates A.19. (No specific persistence format is implied.)

**Operators (OP)**
**CC‑A19.21.** Use of `Align_B` in gating **MUST** **declare** the **Bridge** used and propagate **CL** into assurance (B.3). Cross‑context comparison without a Bridge is **forbidden**. (No requirement to store an ID is imposed by A.19.)

### 7 · Anti‑patterns → safe rewrites

_The following are common modeling mistakes (“anti-patterns”) related to measurement spaces, and how to correct them:_

-   **“Same label ⇒ comparable.”**  
    ✗ _Assuming_ **Ready@contextA ≥ Ready@contextB** _just because both states are called "Ready"._  
    ✓ **Explicitly map and bridge contexts:** Define an Alignment **Bridge (B→A)** and appropriate **gauge mappings** for the underlying metrics. Then compare by first translating one state’s coordinates (compute **G(x)** in the target space) and using `≼_coord` on the result. If no valid translation, declare **incomparable** instead of guessing equivalence.
    
-   **“Compare before landing.”**  
    ✗ Comparing values directly across different scales, e.g. _Drift\_A = 5°C vs Drift\_B = 5°F_ as if they were the same.  
    ✓ **Normalize to common units first:** e.g. apply the Fahrenheit-to-Celsius formula _g_(T<sub>F</sub>) = (T<sub>F</sub> − 32) × 5/9 to convert all data to °C, **then** compare the drift values. Always convert or map into one space before comparing magnitudes.
    
-   **“Checklist = workflow.”**  
    ✗ Defining a state’s checklist with an implied sequence: _“State ‘Ready’ requires doing Step 1 then Step 2…”_  
    ✓ **Keep checklists declarative:** A **Checklist** should represent a state of the system (a condition) – essentially **state evidence** – not a sequence of actions. If order or process matters, model that explicitly via a **MethodDescription** or by using a **Γ** (Gamma) aggregator for process logic. In other words, state = “Ready” might require conditions A and B to be true (regardless of how you got there), whereas the procedure to get ready (do Step1 then Step2) should be a separate method or playbook.
    
-   **“Retro-fix past assertions.”**  
    ✗ Going back to edit or reinterpret old StateAssertions after changing a threshold or gauge (e.g. “We updated the criteria, let’s ‘fix’ last quarter’s records to match”).  
    ✓ **Never alter historical assertions:** **Leave history as-is.** If criteria change, issue new assertions under the new criteria going forward, and if needed, explicitly **version** the gauge or checklist. Past assertions remain valid for the old version and their time; new ones apply henceforth. This ensures auditability and avoids erasing or rewriting what was true under earlier standards.


# **A.19.D1 — CG‑frame (comparability & Gauge)** \[D]

> **Scope** This CG‑frame Algebra & Gauge Discipline A.19 by freezing the **governance contract** for CG‑frames, defining a **conformance checklist** and **regression harness**, and giving **didactic one‑pagers** and **anti‑patterns** so teams can introduce CG‑frames without tool lock‑in. The mandatory pattern structure and authoring discipline referenced from **Part E** (Style Guide, Tell‑Show‑Show, checklists, DRR, guard‑rails) are applied throughout.

## 1 · Context

A.19 established a substrate‑neutral picture:

* a **CG‑frame** = *(Context‑local)* **Characterisation Space (CS)** + **chart** (coordinate patch + units) + **gauge** (admissible re‑parameterisations that preserve meaning);
* **operators** (subspace, product, pullback/pushforward) and **comparability** (coordinatewise vs **gauge‑based**);
* **RSG touch‑points**: role readiness (**RSG** states) are **certified** against CS via **checklists** over observable characteristics;
* **entity/relational mixtures** across CG‑frames via minimal schemas and bridges.

**Terminology guard.** *CG‑frame* is the **lens** (I); *CG‑Spec* is the **governance card** (S) that fixes admissible charts/gauges/comparability/Γ‑fold for that lens **in one `U.BoundedContext`**; *CG‑Description* is the didactic surface (D) with worked examples and anti‑patterns.

A.19.D1 makes this *operational and auditable*.

---

## 2 · Problem

Absent a governance layer, four failure modes recur:

1. **Chartless numbers.** Measures move between teams without units, reference states, or declared gauge → **illusory comparability**.
2. **Hidden gauge flips.** Re‑parameterisations (e.g., normalising by batch size) silently alter meaning; trend lines lie.
3. **CG‑frame sprawl.** Every initiative mints a new “dashboard dimension”; semantics diverge; assurance collapses.
4. **Un‑bridgeable reports.** Cross‑team roll‑ups average **incongruent** CG‑frames, violating the **weakest‑link (WLNK)** discipline from Γ and B.3.

---

## 3 · Forces

| Force                         | Tension we must balance                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Universality vs nuance**    | One contract for robotics, safety, finance — yet leave each context’s idioms intact. |
| **Speed vs audit**            | Light ceremony for on‑ramp; hard guarantees for assurance and SoD.                   |
| **Local truth vs federation** | Keep CG‑frames meaning‑local; still enable **explicit** bridging across Contexts.          |
| **Minimalism vs safety**      | Few mandatory slots; enough structure to forbid silent gauge drift.                  |

---

## 4 · Solution — **The CG‑Spec** (CG‑Spec) + **Registry** + **Bridges**

### 4.1 The **CG‑Spec** (comparability&gauge specification per CG‑frame, in one `U.BoundedContext`)

A **CG‑frame** is governed by a compact, notation‑free card:

```
CG‑Spec {
  name            : CG‑frameName        // local to Context
  context         : U.BoundedContext // edition/version included
  cs_basis      : [{
      slot_id       : <tech-token>,           // стабильный id слота (basis name)
      characteristic: <U.Characteristic>,     // по A.17 / A.18
      scale         : { type: ordinal|interval|ratio, unit?: <U.Unit>, bounds?: <...> },
      polarity      : up|down|target-range,   // ориентированность сравнения
      // при необходимости: missingness?, admissible_domain?, orientation? (мета из MM‑CHR)
    }] 
  chart           : { reference_state, coordinate_patch, measurement_protocol_ref }
  gauge           : { group_of_transforms, invariants, admissible_rescalings }
  comparability   : { mode ∈ {coordinatewise, gauge-based}, minimal evidence }
  acceptance      : { checklist_for_admission, window, evidence anchors }    // gates RSG state checks
  aggregation     : { Γ_fold, WLNK/COMM/LOC/MONO choices, time policy }      // safe roll-up recipe
  alignment?      : { bridges_to_other_contexts, CL levels, loss notes }     // optional
  lifecycle       : { owner_role, DRR links, deprecation plan }
}
```

**Reading:** *A CG‑frame is a context‑local lens with declared characteristics, units, a chart to read them, a gauge that states what “doesn’t matter,” and explicit rules for when a datum counts and how many can be safely folded.*

`GaugeKinds`, `MetricSpec` and `QuotientSpec` are **CG‑frame‑level** governance metadata; per **A19‑CS‑5** the kernel `CharacteristicSpace` carries **no gauges** or composition; gauges/normalizations live in **MM‑CHR**.

**L‑CG‑Spec‑BASIS‑META**: each element in  cs_basis\[\*\] includes at least {characteristic, scale.type, polarity}; for interval/ratio unit is mandatory.

### 4.2 **CG‑frame Registry** (per Context)

Each `U.BoundedContext` keeps a **CG‑frame Registry** (VR):

* **canonical names** and **editions**;
* **SoD hooks** (who can edit CG‑Spec, who can certify admission);
* **deprecation map** (what replaces what, when).

### 4.3 **Bridges** (across contexts)

Cross‑context reuse occurs **only** via explicit **Alignment Bridges** (F.9) between CG‑Specs:

```

## 5 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

> **Pass these and your CG‑frames are fit for assurance and cross‑team composition.**

**CC‑A19.D1‑1 (Local scope).** Every CG‑frame **MUST** live inside a declared `U.BoundedContext` (with edition). Names are **local**; same label in another Context ≠ same CG‑frame.

**CC‑A19.D1‑2 (Units & polarity).** Each characteristic in `cs_charasteristics` **MUST** declare **unit/scale** and **polarity** (↑ better / ↓ better / target range). No unlabeled magnitudes.

**CC‑A19.D1‑3 (Chart).** `chart` **MUST** name the **reference state**, **coordinate patch** and **measurement protocol** (`U.MethodDescription`) to make numbers reproducible.

**CC‑A19.D1‑4 (Gauge).** `gauge` **MUST** list the **admissible transforms** (e.g., affine rescale, monotone map) **and** the **invariants** they preserve (what comparability means).

**CC‑A19.D1‑5 (Comparability mode).** `comparability.mode` **MUST** be either **coordinatewise** (same chart & units) or **gauge‑based** (after normalisation by the declared gauge). Mixed/implicit modes are prohibited.

**CC‑A19.D1‑6 (Admission checklist).** `acceptance.checklist_for_admission` **MUST** be observable and time‑bounded; each datum admitted to the CG‑frame **SHALL** cite a **StateAssertion** or equivalent `U.Evaluation`.

**CC‑A19.D1‑7 (Aggregation discipline).** `aggregation.Γ_fold` **MUST** specify WLNK/COMM/LOC/MONO choices and the **time policy** (e.g., average of rates vs integral of counts). No free‑hand averages.

**CC‑A19.D1‑8 (Bridge‑only reuse).** Cross‑context consumption **MUST** cite a **Bridge** with CL and **loss notes**; coordinate‑by‑name without a Bridge **fails**.

**CC‑A19.D1‑9 (SoD & roles).** Editing CG‑Spec and admitting data **MUST** be performed by **different** roles (⊥ enforced): `CG‑frameStewardRole ⊥ CG‑frameCertifierRole` inside the same context.

**CC‑A19.D1‑10 (Lifecycle & DRR).** Every CG‑Spec **MUST** carry an **owner role**, a **deprecation plan**, and links to **DRR** entries for rationale and changes (Part E.9).

**CC‑A19.D1‑11 (Anchors & lanes for comparability).** Any **admission** into a CG‑frame that is later **used for comparison/aggregation** **SHALL** cite the corresponding **A.10 EvidenceRole** anchors for each characteristic, with **assuranceUse lane** tags {TA, VA, LA} and **validity windows** (where applicable), so that the **SCR** can report lane‑separated contributions and freshness (B.3). Absence of anchors for a required characteristic renders items **incomparable**.

**CC‑A19.D1‑12 (Notation independence).** CG‑Spec content **MUST NOT** depend on a tool or file format; semantics precede notation (E.5.2 Notational Independence).

**CC‑A19.D1‑13 (Lexical guard‑rails).** characteristic names and role labels **MUST** follow the Part E lexical discipline (registers, twin labels; no overloaded “process/service/function”).

## 6 · Consequences (informative)

| Benefit                           | Why it matters                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auditable comparability**       | Chart + gauge make “same number” meaningful; silent re‑basings become explicit, reviewable choices.                   |
| **Safe roll‑ups**                 | Γ‑folds with WLNK/COMM/LOC/MONO stop optimistic averaging and preserve invariants.                                    |
| **Pluralism without incoherence** | Bridges with CL and loss notes allow federation without pretending to global sameness.                                |
| **RSG‑ready**                     | Admission checklists let **RSG** states reference **CG‑frame‑backed** facts (e.g., *Ready* requires characteristics within bounds). |

---

## 7 · Rationale (informative)

The CG‑Spec aligns A.19.D1 with **Part E**: it packages Tell‑Show‑Show, Conformance Checklists, and DRR‑backed change, while honouring **DevOps Lexical Firewall**, **Unidirectional Dependency**, and **Notational Independence** so that semantics never depend on tooling.  It also operationalises B.3 **Trust & Assurance** by making CL penalties and WLNK folds first‑class.

---

## 8 · Archetypal Grounding *(Tell‑Show‑Show)*

> **Same slots, three arenas; no tooling implied.**

### 8.1 **Industrial line** — *Weld‑quality CG‑frame* (`AssemblyLine_2026`)

* `cs_basis`: *BeadWidth\[mm] (target 6.0±0.2)*, *Porosity\[ppm] (↓)*, *SeamRate\[1/min] (↑ until limit)*
* `chart`: reference jig, fixture ID, torch type; `MethodDescription#Weld_MIG_v3`
* `gauge`: affine rescale on gray‑level calibration → invariant = physical porosity
* `comparability`: **gauge‑based** (calibration tables applied)
* `aggregation`: WLNK on quality (min‑bound), COMM on counts, time = per‑shift histograms
* **RSG hook**: `WelderRole.Ready` requires *Porosity ≤ 500 ppm* & *BeadWidth within ±0.2 mm* admitted by this CG‑frame.

### 8.2 **Software/SRE line** — *Latency CG‑frame* (`SRE_Prod_Cluster_EU_2026`)

* `cs_basis`: *P50Latency\[ms] (↓)*, *P99Latency\[ms] (↓)*, *Load\[req/s]*
* `chart`: client vantage, trace sampler v4; `MethodDescription#HTTP_probe_v4`
* `gauge`: monotone time‑warp compensation for collector skew; invariant = percentile order
* `comparability`: **gauge‑based** w/ declared normalisation
* `aggregation`: MONO on latency (max of mins), WLNK across services
* **RSG hook**: `DeployerRole.Active` gated if **P99** < declared SLO over admission window.

### 8.3 **Clinical/episteme line** — *Trial‑outcome CG‑frame* (`Cardio_2026`)

* cs_basis:
  - slot_id: ΔBP
    characteristic: BloodPressureChange
    scale: { type: ratio, unit: mmHg }
    polarity: down
  - slot_id: AdverseRate
    characteristic: AdverseEventRate
    scale: { type: ratio, unit: "%" }
    polarity: down
  - slot_id: Age
    characteristic: Age
    scale: { type: ratio, unit: years }
    polarity: neutral
* `chart`: cohort definition; `MethodDescription#TrialProtocol_v5`
* `gauge`: case‑mix adjustment (propensity score); invariant = adjusted ΔBP
* `comparability`: **gauge‑based** (post‑adjustment)
* `aggregation`: LOC on subcohorts; WLNK on safety outcomes
* **RSG hook**: `EvidenceRole.Validated` admission requires CG‑frame acceptance; **Assurance** pulls CL from any Bridge used.


##### 8.4 Worked mini-schemas (entity/relational mixtures across CG‑frames, informative)

To illustrate how CharacteristicSpace is used in practice, below are simplified schema snippets for three typical **CG‑frames**: an **Operations** view (run-time state and action gating), an **Assurance** view (evidence and cross-context comparison), and an **Alignment** view (design-time consistency across contexts). These examples mix entity-based and relational Characteristics and demonstrate how state spaces, gauges, and bridges appear in a model. (The notation is mix of a graph/entity diagram and a relational table outline for clarity. **PK** = primary key, **FK** = foreign key.)

**8.4.1 Operations CG‑frame — Run-time gating & enactment**

_Entity graph view:_

Holder (System) ── playsRoleOf ──> Role@Context ── has ──> RCS (slots…)
RSG (Role@Context) ── owns ──> State (◉ status)
Checklist (of State) ── testedBy ──> Evaluation ── yields ──> StateAssertion
Work ── performedBy ──> RoleAssignment
Work ── isExecutionOf ──> MethodDescription

In the above, a **Holder** (a system instance) plays a **Role** in some Context, which has an attached **RCS** (a set of slots defining its characteristic space). That Role’s **RSG** owns various possible **State** entries (each state could be, e.g., Ready, Waiting, Degraded, etc.). Each State has a **Checklist** which is **tested by** an Evaluation process, resulting in a **StateAssertion** (pass/fail) at runtime. Meanwhile, **Work** instances (concrete operations) are performed by the RoleAssignment and correspond to some MethodDescription (procedure). The “gate” for Work is that a StateAssertion for an enactable state must exist.

_Relational stub:_ (illustrating how data might be stored)

| Table | Key Columns (essential) |
| --- | --- |
| **ROLE\_ASSIGNMENT** | `RA_ID` (PK); `HOLDER_ID`; `ROLE_ID`; `CONTEXT_ID`; `WINDOW_FROM`, `WINDOW_TO` |
| **RCS\_SNAPSHOT** | `SNAP_ID` (PK); `RA_ID` (FK to ROLE\_ASSIGNMENT); `WINDOW_FROM`, `WINDOW_TO`; `CHAR_ID`; `VALUE`; `UNIT`; `SCALE_TYPE` |
| **RSG\_STATE** | `STATE_ID` (PK); `ROLE_ID`; `CONTEXT_ID`; `NAME`; `ENACTABLE` (bool) |
| **CHECKLIST** | `CHK_ID` (PK); `STATE_ID` (FK to RSG\_STATE); `PREDICATE_TYPE`; `PREDICATE_SPEC` |
| **STATE\_ASSERTION** | `SA_ID` (PK); `RA_ID` (FK); `STATE_ID` (FK); `CHK_ID` (FK); `WINDOW_FROM`, `WINDOW_TO`; `VERDICT` (pass/fail); `GAUGE_ID`?; `BRIDGE_ID`? |
| **WORK** | `WORK_ID` (PK); `RA_ID` (FK); `METHODDESC_ID` (FK to MethodDescription); `WINDOW_FROM`, `WINDOW_TO`; _(other fields like results or references)_ |

In this schema: an RCS snapshot table might log individual coordinate values (`VALUE`) for each Characteristic (`CHAR_ID`) in a given RoleAssignment, with their units and scale type noted (to ensure we know what the number means). The StateAssertion ties a RoleAssignment to a state checklist and says whether it passed, including references to any gauge or bridge if cross-context or scaled comparisons were involved. The gate logic for enactment can then be a query like: “Is Work W admissible now?” – which joins through ROLE\_ASSIGNMENT to find the latest StateAssertion for that RA where `ENACTABLE=true` and `VERDICT=pass`.

**8.4..2 Assurance CG‑frame — Evidence freshness & mapped comparisons**

_Entity graph view:_

GaugeMap ── maps ──> Characteristic   (each gauge mapping is a monotone transform)
Bridge (ContextB → ContextA)   (Alignment Bridge between contexts, with CL and loss notes)
StateAssertion ── uses ──> {GaugeMap, Bridge}   (if a state comparison crossed contexts)

This view highlights that in the assurance context, we keep track of how we mapped or compared states:

-   A **GaugeMap** entity (analogous to what was called Gaugecharacteristic) represents a monotonic mapping from one Characteristic’s scale to another’s.
    
-   A **Bridge** between Context B and Context A (for corresponding roles or states) carries a CL rating and possibly notes on what is “lost in translation.”
    
-   A **StateAssertion** may **use** a gauge or a bridge, meaning that assertion was reached by translating data via that gauge or comparing across that bridge.
    

_Relational stub:_

| Table                | Key Columns (essential)                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GAUGE\_MAP**       | `GAUGE_ID` (PK); `SRC_CHAR_ID`; `TGT_CHAR_ID`; `FORMULA_SPEC`; `MONOTONIC` (bool) /\* + optional calibration info \*/                 |
| **BRIDGE**           | `BRIDGE_ID` (PK); `FROM_ROLE@CTX`; `TO_ROLE@CTX`; `CL` (congruence-loss level, e.g. 0–3); `NOTES` (description of losses/adjustments) |
| **ASSURANCE\_EVENT** | `AE_ID` (PK); `SA_ID` (FK to StateAssertion); `EFFECT` (enum: penalty\_applied, evidence\_refreshed, etc.); `DETAILS`                 |

In this stub, GAUGE\_MAP defines each cross-scale mapping that has to be accounted for (with `FORMULA_SPEC` describing how to compute the target value from the source). The Bridge table enumerates official Bridges between contexts (for example, bridging a “Ready” state in an engineering context to “Ready” in an operations context, with CL indicating how fully comparable they are). An ASSURANCE\_EVENT log could record when a penalty was applied due to a low-CL Bridge or when an assertion was refreshed or invalidated due to new evidence or time lapse. (For instance, policy might say if a critical state assertion uses a Bridge with CL < 2 in a safety context, a special waiver or secondary approval is needed – that could be represented as an event requiring a **Waiver** action.)

**8.4.3 Alignment CG‑frame — Design-time reuse of states across Contexts**

_Entity graph view:_

Checklist(ContextA.State)   ← pull(G) —   Checklist’(ContextB.State’)   (pull a checklist via gauge G)
Refinement π : RSG(Role' ≤ Role)   (RSG refinement mapping, e.g. Role' is a subtype of Role)

This view covers how _design-time_ alignment happens:

-   A **Checklist’** for a state in Context B can be **pulled** via some gauge mapping G into Context A to become a derived Checklist for a state in Context A. This is effectively what we described in the pull operation: using another context’s criteria in your own space.
    
-   A **Refinement π** is shown between RSGs indicating Role’ is a specialized role of Role (e.g. a sub-role or a scenario-specific role) and how their states relate (Role’ might have extra states or more granular distinctions). This refinement should maintain that for each state in Role’ that maps to a state in Role, the entails/implication relation holds for enactability.
    

_Relational stub:_

| Table               | Key Columns                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RSG\_REFINEMENT** | `MAP_ID` (PK); `ROLEPRIME_ID` (FK to Role' in Context B); `ROLE_ID` (FK to Role in Context A); `STATEPRIME_ID` (FK to state in Role' RSG); `STATE_ID` (FK to state in Role RSG); `ENTAILS` (bool) |
| **CHECKLIST\_PULL** | `PULL_ID` (PK); `SRC_STATE_ID`; `TGT_STATE_ID`; `GAUGE_ID` (FK to GaugeMap used); `VERSION`? /\* and perhaps timestamp \*/                                                                        |

In this stub, RSG\_REFINEMENT maps states of a sub-role to states of a super-role, with an `ENTAILS` flag indicating if being in the sub-state guarantees being in the super-state. **Every refinement mapping should ensure at least one enactable state in the sub-role corresponds to an enactable state in the super-role** (or else the sub-role would allow something the super-role doesn’t – that’s an alignment lint check). The CHECKLIST\_PULL table records that a state from one context has had its checklist pulled into another context via a gauge (identified by GAUGE\_ID). This is a design artifact saying “State X in context A is defined by applying gauge G to State Y in context B’s criteria.” A version or validity field might ensure we know which edition of the checklist or gauge was used.

## 9 · Anti‑patterns (and the fix)

| Anti‑pattern            | Symptom                                   | Why it hurts                 | Fix (CG‑Spec slot)                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Chartless number**    | “Latency = 120”                           | No unit/vantage → untestable | Fill `cs_charasteristics` + `chart`                |
| **Gauge smuggling**     | Quiet “per‑unit” normalisation mid‑stream | Trend reversal               | Declare `gauge` + keep invariant        |
| **Bridge‑by‑name**      | Reusing labels across Contexts               | False comparability          | Author **Bridge** with CL + loss        |
| **Free‑hand averaging** | Arithmetic mean on bounded risks          | Violates WLNK                | Declare `Γ_fold` with WLNK              |
| **CG‑frame sprawl**        | Ten nearly‑identical CG‑frames               | Cognitive debt               | Use Registry + DRR; prefer reuse        |
| **Role conflation**     | Same person edits CG‑Spec & certifies data     | SoD breach                   | Enforce `CG‑frameSteward ⊥ CG‑frameCertifier` |

## 10 · Didactic quick cards (one‑liners teams reuse)

1. **Numbers travel with their Context.** Always cite `Context@Edition`.
2. **If the gauge is not written, the trend is fiction.**
3. **WLNK beats wishful means.** Use weakest‑link folds for safety.
4. **Admit → Assert → Act.** (CG‑frame admission → RSG StateAssertion → Method step).
5. **Bridge or bust.** Cross‑context = Bridge with CL and loss notes.
6. **Steward writes, Certifier admits.** (SoD by design.)
7. **Charts are recipes.** Name the `MethodDescription` that made the number.
8. **Deprecate in the open.** CG‑frame cards carry DRR & retirement plans.
9. **Keep characteristics few, meanings sharp.** Prefer ≤ 7 characteristics per CG‑frame.
10. **No tooling names in Core.** Semantics first; notation later.

## 11 · SCR / RSCR Harness (acceptance & regression)

> **These are concept‑level checks; notation‑agnostic.**

### 11.1 **SCR — Acceptance (first introduction)**

* **SCR‑A19.4‑S01 (Completeness).** CG‑Spec has **all** mandatory slots; `cs_basis` include **unit/scale/polarity**; `chart` references a `MethodDescription`.
* **SCR‑A19.4‑S02 (Gauge clarity).** `gauge` lists admissible transforms **and** named invariants.
* **SCR‑A19.4‑S03 (Comparability test).** Provide one worked example showing **coordinatewise** or **gauge‑based** comparison end‑to‑end (with evidence anchors).
* **SCR‑A19.4‑S04 (Γ‑fold audit).** Aggregation rule spells out WLNK/COMM/LOC/MONO choices; reviewer reconstructs result on a toy set.
* **SCR‑A19.4‑S05 (SoD).** Distinct `RoleAssignments` for `CG‑frameStewardRole` and `CG‑frameCertifierRole` exist; windows do not overlap.
* **SCR‑A19.4‑S06 (Aboutness & anchors surfaced).** For each CG‑Spec characteristic used in the worked example, cite the corresponding CHR Characteristic name and the evidence anchor(s) (A.10) that make the reading observable in this Context.

### 11.2 **RSCR — Regression (on change)**

* **RSCR‑A19.4‑R01 (Gauge edit).** On changing `gauge`, flag **all** downstream Bridges for CL re‑assessment; re‑run example comparisons.
* **RSCR‑A19.4‑R02 (Slot surgery/Basis surgery).** Adding/removing/renaming slot/basis requires a **new edition**; old data remain valid **for their edition**.
* **RSCR‑A19.4‑R03 (Chart drift).** Updating measurement protocol bumps edition; **historic Work** keeps old edition link.
* **RSCR‑A19.4‑R04 (Fold change).** Any change to `Γ_fold` invalidates cached roll‑ups; re‑compute or mark as superseded.
* **RSCR‑A19.4‑R05 (Bridge health).** After either side’s edition change, **re‑validate** Bridge CL and loss notes before accepting Cross‑context data.
* **RSCR‑A19.4‑R06 (Deprecation rule).** On deprecating a CG‑frame, Registry lists its successor; bridges re‑targeted or retired.

---

## 12 · Interaction summary (wiring to the rest of the kernel)

* **A.2 / A.2.5 (Roles / RSG).** RSG **checklists** quote **CG‑Spec.acceptance**; enactment gates rely on **admitted** CG‑frame data.
* **B.1 (Γ‑algebra).** CG‑Spec’s `Γ_fold` instantiates Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time/WLNK/MONO choices explicitly.
* **B.3 (Assurance).** Bridge CL enters the **R** term; WLNK protects safety roll‑ups.
* **C.6 / C.7 (LOG‑CAL / CHR‑CAL).** Units, scales, and measurement templates come from CHR; proofs about folds live in LOG‑CAL.

** Certification data contract (minimal).** (For implementation completeness, not a user-facing concern.) At minimum, any state certification function should take as input: a specific holon (holder) in a given Role and Context and a time window, and it should have access to a **snapshot** of all relevant RCS coordinates for that Role (plus any other needed observations or speech-act logs in that window). +It should output a **StateAssertion** object that includes: the target state’s identifier, the checklist (or checklist ID) used, the verdict (pass/fail); `evidence_kind ∈ {observation, prediction}`; the **window** `[t_from, t_to]`; for `prediction` also the **horizon Δt** and the **normalization/gauge** snapshot used; and references to the supporting observations. If any gauges or cross-context Bridges were used, those **MUST** be referenced (IDs) so that any **CL** penalty (B.3) can be applied deterministically. This is to ensure traceability and to apply any assurance penalties. Invariants for this process include: no “secret” criteria (all checklist conditions must be based on observable data, not insider knowledge), versioning of checklists (if a checklist changes version, new assertions are tagged to the new version; old assertions aren’t retroactively modified), and immutability of past assertions (once recorded, a StateAssertion isn’t edited after the fact – if it was wrong or conditions changed, a new assertion is issued instead of altering history).

### Close

A.19.D1 gives A.19 some **teeth**: a *CG‑Spec* you can put on one page, a **Registry** that stops sprawl, **Bridges** that carry explicit loss, and a **checklist + harness** that make comparability **auditable**. It obeys the **mandatory pattern structure** of Part E (style, checklists, DRR, guard‑rails) while remaining tool‑agnostic and context‑local.

# Part B – Trans‑disciplinary Reasoning Cluster

## **B .1 · Universal Algebra of Aggregation (Γ)** \[A]

### 1. Context

FPF views reality as a **nested holarchy**: parts → assemblies → systems → ecosystems; axioms → lemmas → theories → paradigms (this is only example, exact levels of holarhy as hierarhy of holons is not defined and project-depended). Each level is a **`U.Holon`** that becomes the part of a wider holon one tier up — but only **after** an explicit act of construction has glued the parts together. That act is performed by a physical *Transformer* playing `TransformerRole` executing a method over an explicit **Dependency Graph**. Without a domain‑neutral *law of composition* binding these moves, the logical ladder between scales would break, violating the core rule **Cross‑Scale Consistency**.

---

### 2. Problem

If each discipline (or project team) invents its own way of “adding things up”, four lethal pathologies appear:

1. **Compositional Chaos** — identical parts aggregated by two tools yield different wholes; parallel work becomes impossible.
2. **Brittle Dashboards** — system‑level KPIs lie because the roll‑up silently hides the weakest component.
3. **Invalid Extrapolation** — proofs that hold locally break globally; safety cases collapse on integration day.
4. **Emergence as Magic** — genuine synergy (“whole > sum parts”) is indistinguishable from a modelling error.

All four are witnessed in post‑2015 incidents, from micro‑service outages to meta‑analysis retractions.

### 3. Forces

| Force                           | Tension                                                                                    |   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | - |
| **Universality vs Specificity** | One algebra must work for pumps, proofs and policies ↔ each domain owns quirky edge‑cases. |   |
| **Determinism vs Emergence**    | Predictable, order‑free folds ↔ need to legitimise authentic novelty.                      |   |
| **Safety vs Synergy**           | Conservative *Weakest‑Link* bound ↔ modelling genuine redundancy wins.                     |   |
| **Simplicity vs Fidelity**      | Five rules managers can remember ↔ enough depth for formal proof.                          |   |
| **Auditability vs Overhead**    | Machine‑checkable contract ↔ authors must show their invariants.                           |   |

### 4. Solution — **The Invariant Quintet Contract**

> *FPF freezes one universal operator, **Γ**, and binds it to five non‑negotiable invariants. Compliance with the quintet is the ticket that lets any calculus, in any future discipline, plug into the holarchy.*

* **`T`** — an external `U.TransformerRole` (not a node of `D`); see A.12.
*Result:* a new holon at level *k + 1* whose boundary encloses every node of `D`.

Because Γ is *externalised* through `T`, the provenance chain stays intact, satisfying the **Transformer Principle**;

#### 4.2 · The Five Grounding Invariants

| Code     | Invariant             | Plain‑English headline                            | Why it matters                               |   |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | - |
| **IDEM** | *Idempotence*         | One part alone stays itself.                      | Anchors recursion; stops base‑case drift.    |   |
| **COMM** | *Local Commutativity* | Swap independent parts, nothing changes.          | Enables divide‑and‑conquer builds.           |   |
| **LOC**  | *Locality*            | Which worker or rack runs the fold is irrelevant. | Guarantees reproducible distributed runs.    |   |
| **WLNK** | *Weakest‑Link Bound*  | No claim may exceed the frailest part.            | Keeps dashboards honest; caps hidden risk.   |   |
| **MONO** | *Monotonicity*        | Improving any part never hurts the whole.         | Justifies “fix the bottleneck” optimisation. |   |

*Mnemonic for managers:* **S‑O‑L‑I‑D** → Same, Order‑free, Location‑free, Inferior‑cap, Don’t‑regress.

**Archetypal Grounding**

The Invariant Quintet is not an abstract mathematical construct; it is a formalization of common-sense physical and logical realities that manifest across all domains.

| Invariant | `U.System` — Pump Skid Assembly | `U.Episteme` — Scientific Meta-Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IDEM** | An assembly of a single pump is just that pump, with its original specifications. | A review of a single study is just that study, with its original conclusions and evidence level. |
| **COMM / LOC** | Welding two independent pump modules to the skid in a different order or in different assembly bays results in an identical final product. | The conclusions of a meta-analysis are independent of the order in which two unrelated studies were added to the evidence pool. |
| **WLNK** | The maximum pressure rating of the entire pump skid is limited by the pressure rating of its weakest pump or connector. | The overall reliability of a synthesized theory is capped by the reliability of its least-supported foundational claim. |
| **MONO** | Replacing a standard motor with a more powerful, efficient one can only improve or maintain the skid's overall performance; it cannot make it worse. | Adding a new, high-quality study to a meta-analysis can only strengthen or maintain the overall confidence in its conclusion, never weaken it (unless it introduces a conflict). |

#### 4.3 · Why only five?  (A didactic sidebar)

* Post‑2015 physics shows that renormalisation flows stabilise if and **only if** idempotence, locality and monotone bounds hold (Goldenfeld & Ho 2018).
* Distributed‑data research (Spark 3, Flink 1.19) proves COMM + LOC are prerequisites for deterministic sharding.
* Safety cases in aviation and ISO 26262 rewrote their risk roll‑ups around *Weakest‑Link* after 2021 audit failures.

Thus the quintet is simultaneously **empirically vetted**, **mathematically minimal**, and **cognitively teachable**.

#### 4.4 · Emergence Without Cheating

Real redundancy can push a system above the WLNK ceiling (e.g., RAID 6 survives two disk deaths). FPF treats this not as a rule break but as a **Meta‑Holon Transition (MHT)**: the redundant set is promoted to a fresh holon tier, and the quintet re‑applies there. The algebra stays pure; emergence becomes explicit, auditable design space. Details live in Pattern **B.2 Meta‑Holon Transition (MHT): Recognizing Emergence and Re‑identifying Wholes** (next in cluster).;

### 5 · Domain‑Specific “Flavours” of Γ

The core signature of Γ never changes, but each discipline supplies a **flavour** that instantiates the quintet with domain‑appropriate mathematics and measurement units.

### 6 · Walkthrough Examples

#### 6.1 `Γ\_sys` — Offshore Wind Farm (2025 build)

1. **Parts**: 72 nacelles, 72 towers, 1 export cable set.
2. **Graph**: acyclic; each nacelle depends on its own tower, all depend on cable.
3. **Fold**: Any parallel assembly order is legal → COMM, LOC.
4. **WLNK check**: weakest nacelle (load factor = 0.91) bounds farm output ≤ 0.91 × rated.
5. **Upgrade test**: swapping one nacelle to 0.95 raises farm bound — satisfies MONO.

*Result*: farm holon inherits predictable capacity curve; financiers can quote risk‑adjusted yield without bespoke simulation.

#### 6.2 `Γ_epist` — Living Systematic Review on mRNA Therapies (2024–2025)

1. **Parts**: 38 peer‑reviewed trials, 12 preprints.
2. **Graph**: dependency edges encode shared cohorts; no cycles.
3. **Fold**: trials merged irrespective of ingestion order → COMM; distributed evaluators may differ, but provenance hashes equalise weighting → LOC.
4. **WLNK**: overall certainty cannot exceed the lowest GRADE score among included trials.
5. **Emergence**: discovery of a consistent age‑interaction effect violates WLNK; reviewers declare **MHT**, elevating the combined dataset to a new holon “Evidence v2” with age‑stratified potency as a *novel attribute*.

*Result*: regulators see a transparent promotion of evidence tier rather than a hidden statistical artefact.

#### 6.3 `Γ\_time` — National Grid Frequency Forecast (2025‑2030)

*COMM* holds only across non‑overlapping windows; *LOC* is waived because regional sensors differ in latency.  Additional TS‑1/TS‑2 rules ensure gaps are filled before aggregation.  Engineers iterate locally yet obtain one coherent five‑year projection.

### 9 · Rationale

The Invariant Quintet is the "renormalisation law" of FPF. It translates deep principles from physics, computer science, and engineering into a universal, algebraic contract that governs composition in any domain.

**Physics & Renormalisation:** The invariants mirror the laws of renormalisation group (RG) flows. IDEM, COMM, and LOC ensure that the aggregation is a well-behaved coarse-graining operation, while WLNK acts as a conservative bound on energy and risk, preventing "free lunch" synergies from appearing by mere arithmetic.
*   **Distributed Systems:** The COMM and LOC invariants are the formal prerequisites for modern, large-scale distributed computing. Systems like Spark and Flink rely on the guarantee that data can be processed on independent workers in any order, and the final result will be deterministic.
*   **Systems Engineering & Safety:** The WLNK and MONO invariants are cornerstones of safety-critical design. Fault-tree analysis and reliability engineering are built on the WLNK principle that a system is no stronger than its weakest link. The MONO principle provides the formal justification for iterative improvement ("Kaizen"): it guarantees that a local fix will not cause a global regression.

By elevating these cross-disciplinary insights to the level of a mandatory, constitutional contract, FPF ensures that all composition within the framework is predictable, auditable, and physically plausible. It transforms aggregation from an ad-hoc, domain-specific art into a universal, repeatable science.
 
### 10 · Anti-Patterns & Conceptual Repairs

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Conceptual Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Averaging Risk** | A dashboard shows a high overall reliability score for a system by averaging a high-reliability component with a low-reliability one. | Enforce the **WLNK** invariant. The aggregate reliability must be `min(R_parts)`, not `avg(R_parts)`. |
| **Order-Dependent Builds**| The same set of software architheories produces a different final build depending on the compilation order. | Enforce **COMM/LOC**. Identify the hidden dependency between the architheories and either remove it or make it explicit, moving to `Γ\_ctx` if necessary. |
| **Improvement Paradox** | A team replaces a component with a better one, but a system-level KPI gets worse. | Enforce **MONO**. This indicates a hidden, negative coupling. The model must be updated to make this coupling an explicit constraint or interaction. |
| **Synergy by Narrative** | A claim is made that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, without a formal mechanism. | This violates **WLNK**. If the synergy is real (e.g., due to redundancy or a new feedback loop), it must be modeled as a **Meta-Holon Transition** (Pattern B.2). |

> **Take‑home maxim:** *“Aggregation is never neutral; Γ makes its politics explicit and testable.”*

## **B.1.1 Dependency Graph & Proofs** **\[D]**

### 1) Context

In FPF, every aggregation is a *material act*:

```
Γ : (D : DependencyGraph, T : U.TransformerRole) → H′ : U.Holon
```

`D` is the *only* admissible input shape for Γ. It must capture **part–whole** structure faithfully (A.1, A.14) while staying neutral to order (handled by Γ\_ctx / Γ\_method), time (Γ\_time), and accounting (Γ\_work). If `D` is sloppy—mixing kinds of relations or scopes—Γ becomes unpredictable and the Quintet invariants (IDEM, COMM, LOC, WLNK, MONO) fail in subtle ways.

This pattern normatively defines `DependencyGraph`, the **mereological vocabulary** allowed on its edges, and the **guards** that make Γ provable and comparable across domains.

---

### 2) Problem

Without a disciplined `DependencyGraph`, four pathologies recur:

1. **Relation drift:** Edges blur composition with mapping (e.g., “represents”), or confuse collections with parts. Aggregations then mix algebraic regimes (sums where mins are required, etc.).
2. **Boundary blindness:** Cross‑holon influences are drawn as parts, bypassing explicit `U.Boundary` and `U.Interaction`. This corrupts locality (LOC) and defeats reproducible folding.
3. **Temporal conflation:** `design‑time` and `run‑time` holons appear in one graph; simulations then “prove” facts about a blueprint using live telemetry.
4. **Hidden cycles:** Self‑dependence enters through aliasing (e.g., a team is a member of itself via “units of units”). Γ cannot topologically fold such graphs.

---

### 3) Forces

| Force                              | Tension                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs. Precision**     | One schema for systems and epistemes ↔ different composition logics (physical vs. conceptual) must be kept distinct but compatible. |
| **Parsimony vs. Expressiveness**   | Keep the vocabulary small (A.11) ↔ include the minimal extra relations that engineers actually use (A.14).                          |
| **Locality vs. Connectivity**      | Preserve boundary‑local reasoning (LOC) ↔ still allow explicit external influences via interactions, not parthood.                  |
| **Static clarity vs. Dynamic use** | Graphs must be easy to read and verify ↔ also feed Γ\_ctx, Γ\_time, Γ\_method, Γ\_work without duplications or mismatches.            |

---

### 4) Solution 

#### 4.1 The shape: a typed, scoped, acyclic graph

**Definition.**

```
DependencyGraph D = (V, E, scope, notes)
```

* **V (nodes):** each `v ∈ V` is a `U.Holon` with:

  * `holonKind ∈ {U.System, U.Episteme}`
  * `temporalScope ∈ {design, run}` (A.4) — **single, uniform per D**
  * a declared `U.Boundary` (A.14)
  * optional characteristics (e.g., F–G–R, CL, Agency metrics) for use by downstream patterns (B.1.2/3; B.3; A.13)
* **E (edges):** each `e ∈ E` is a **mereological** relation from the **normative vocabulary `V_rel`** (below).
* **scope:** the uniform temporal scope of the entire graph (`design` or `run`).
* **acyclicity:** `D` **MUST** be a DAG. Any cycle requires refactoring or elevation to a Meta‑Holon (B.2).

> **Strict distinction (A.15).**
> `DependencyGraph` encodes **part–whole** only. Order goes to Γ\_ctx/Γ\_method. Time evolution goes to Γ\_time. Resource spending goes to Γ\_work. Cross‑boundary influence goes to `U.Interaction` (not parthood).

---

#### 4.2 Normative edge vocabulary `V_rel` (A.14 compliant)

Only the following **four** **mereological** relations are allowed in `E` (A.14):


| Family               | Relation             | Short intent                                            | Where it belongs                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Structural**       | **ComponentOf**      | physical/machined part in an assembly                   | Γ_sys                               |
|                      | **ConstituentOf**    | logical/content part in a conceptual whole              | Γ_epist                             |
| **Quantity & Phase** | **PortionOf**        | quantitative fraction of a homogeneous stock or carrier | Γ_sys / Γ_work                      |
|                      | **PhaseOf**          | temporal phase/slice of the *same carrier*              | Γ_time / Γ_work                     |

**Not in `V_rel` (by design):**
* `SerialStepOf`, `ParallelFactorOf` — **order/concurrency** edges of Γ_method/Γ_ctx; **not** parthood; keep them out of `E` (see § 4.1 A.15 and Part B.1.5).
* `MemberOf` — **non‑mereological** collective membership; model in Γ_collective (B.1.7), **not** in `E` (**see § 9**).
 * `RepresentationOf`, `MapsTo`, `Implements` — these are **mappings**, not parthood; model them at the value level (A.15) or as `U.Interaction` between holons.
* `RoleBearerOf` — links a `U.System` to a `U.Role`; **not** parthood (see A.12, A.15).
* Any “is‑a” (`subClassOf`) taxonomic relation — orthogonal to parthood.

#### 4.3 Minimal axioms & type guards per relation

| Relation             | Axioms (informal)                                                 | Guards / When to use                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **ComponentOf**      | anti‑symmetric; transitive; acyclic                               | Physical assemblies; interfaces compose via BIC (B.1.2). Do **not** use for collections or pipelines.              |
| **ConstituentOf**    | anti‑symmetric; transitive; acyclic                               | Conceptual or formal wholes (papers, proofs, specifications). Do **not** use for material parts.                   |
| **MemberOf** (**outside `V_rel`**) | not transitive; anti‑symmetric (w\.r.t. same collection); acyclic | Sets/teams/libraries; the whole is a *collective* holon. **Not admissible in `E`**; model via **Γ_collective (B.1.7)**. Use `PortionOf` for homogeneous stocks. |
| **PortionOf**        | anti‑symmetric; additive; acyclic                                 | Quantitative partitions of a *homogeneous* carrier (mass, volume, bytes). Requires an **extensive** attribute.     |
| **PhaseOf**          | anti‑symmetric; covers a timeline; acyclic                        | Time‑slices of the *same* carrier identity. Use only with explicit carrier and non‑overlapping intervals.          |

> **Carrier identity for `PhaseOf`.** The “same thing across phases” must be explicit (e.g., *this* frame across heat/dwell/quench; *this* theory across revisions). If identity changes, you are modelling a **Transformer** creating a **new** holon (A.12) — not a phase.

---

#### 4.4 Selection guide (didactic, normative in spirit)

Use this **one‑page decision** to pick the edge correctly:

1. **Is it a part–whole relation at all?**
   If it is mapping, influence, or reference → **not** parthood. Use `U.Interaction` or value‑level links (A.15).

2. **Is it physical vs. conceptual composition?**
   Physical assembly → **ComponentOf**.
   Conceptual/content inclusion → **ConstituentOf**.

3. **Is it a collection?**
   If the “whole” is a collection/collective → **MemberOf** **(outside `E`, route to Γ_collective (B.1.7))**.
   *Note:* a team’s *members* are `MemberOf` (**outside `E`**); the team’s *tools* are likely `ComponentOf`.

4. **Is it order‑sensitive execution?**
   If step order changes semantics → **route to A.15 (ordered relations)** and aggregate with **Γ_ctx / Γ_method**.
   Do **not** encode order as parthood in this section.

5. **Is it a quantitative fraction of a homogeneous stock?**
   If yes → **PortionOf** (requires an extensive attribute; use in Γ\_sys / Γ\_work).

6. **Is it the *same* carrier across time?**
   If yes → **PhaseOf** (then aggregate with Γ\_time / Γ\_work).

> **Common anti‑patterns and the fix**
> • Using **MemberOf** for material stocks → replace with **PortionOf**.
> • Drawing cross‑boundary “parts” → replace edge with **U.Interaction** plus `ComponentOf` *inside* each holon.
> • Using **ConstituentOf** for a module cage or bracket → that is **ComponentOf**.
> • Treating representation (file ↔ thing) as parthood → keep as value‑level mapping (A.15), not in `D`.

#### 4.5 **Γ_m (Compose‑CAL)** — structural aggregators & trace shape  

**Purpose.** Provide a **minimal constructional generator** for **structural mereology** that keeps the kernel small (C-5), aligns with **A.14** (Portions/Phases/Components discipline), and feeds Working-Model layer publication in LOG without importing tooling or notations. 

**Operators (aggregators).**

Γ_m.sum(parts : Set[U.Entity])       → W : U.Holon
  // for each p ∈ parts assert internal U.KernelPartOf(p, W)

Γ_m.set(elems : Multiset[U.Entity])  → C : U.Holon
  // for each e ∈ elems assert internal U.KernelPartOf(e, C)
  // outward **MemberOf** remains a non‑mereological signal per A.14 (does not build holarchies)

Γ_m.slice(ent : U.Entity, facet : U.Facet) → S : U.Holon
  // assert internal U.KernelPartOf(S, ent) and record facet label


**Trace (conceptual, notation‑independent).**  
`Trace = ⟨ op ∈ {sum, set, slice}, inputs, output, notes ⟩`  
Notes capture boundary tags (A.14), scope (`design|run`), and any independence declarations used by the Quintet proofs (below).

**Invariant footprint on Γ_m traces (inherits B.1 Quintet).**
* **IDEM** — singleton fold returns the part unchanged.  
* **COMM/LOC** — results are invariant under re‑order and local factorisation given an independence declaration (IND‑LOC).  
* **WLNK** — aggregate cannot exceed the weakest limiting attribute among parts; synergy escalates via **B.2 Meta‑Holon Transition**.  
* **MONO** — improving a part on a monotone characteristic cannot worsen the whole, ceteris paribus.

**Exclusions and routing (A.15/A.14).**  
No `parallel` or `temporalSlice` constructor is introduced here; **sequence/parallelism** live in `Γ_ctx/Γ_method`, and **temporal parts** in `Γ_time`. This preserves the firewall between structure, order and time mandated by A.15/A.14.

**Internal proof relation.**  
`U.KernelPartOf` names the **constructional edges inside traces**; it is not part of the public `V_rel` and appears only in the trace/proof narrative (didactic status \[D]).

#### 4.6 Scope and boundary rules (make graphs foldable)

1. **Single temporal scope:** all nodes in `D` share `design` **or** `run`. No mixing (“chimera” graphs are invalid).
2. **Declared boundary:** every holon in `D` has a `U.Boundary`; any cross‑holon influence must be an explicit `U.Interaction`, not parthood.
3. **Acyclicity:** if a cycle is detected, either (a) refactor (e.g., split a collective from an assembly), or (b) escalate to **Meta‑Holon Transition** (B.2) if a new “whole” with novel properties is intended.
4. **Order & time routing:** do **not** encode sequence or history with structural edges; route to Γ\_ctx / Γ\_method / Γ\_time explicitly.
5. **Resource routing:** do **not** encode costs with structural edges; route to Γ\_work (B.1.6) across declared boundaries.

#### 4.7 What “Proofs” mean here (preview of Part 2)

Each Γ flavour (Γ\_sys / Γ\_epist / Γ\_method / Γ\_time / Γ\_work) **must** attach a small, reusable **Proof Kit** showing the Quintet on the given `D`:

* **IDEM**: singleton fold = identity.
* **COMM/LOC**: independence conditions + invariance under local reorder/factorisation.
* **WLNK**: weakest‑link bound (e.g., critical input caps, weakest claim).
* **MONO**: explicit monotone characteristics (what “cannot get worse” means here).

### 5) Didactic mini‑examples 

* **System (assembly):** a motor **ComponentOf** a chassis; wiring harness **ComponentOf** the motor; a *crew* **MemberOf** a team holon (the crew is not a component of the chassis).
* **Episteme (paper):** a lemma **ConstituentOf** a proof; appendices **ConstituentOf** the paper; three datasets **MemberOf** a curated collection; version v2 **PhaseOf** the *same* model.

### 6) The Proof Kit (ready‑made templates for Γ on D)

This section provides **small, reusable proof obligations** you attach to a `DependencyGraph D` when invoking any Γ‑flavour. Each obligation is minimal—just enough to guarantee the **Invariant Quintet** for the stated scope and edge set.

#### 6.1 Independence declaration (for COMM/LOC)

> **Obligation IND‑LOC.**
> Provide a **partition of D** into subgraphs `{Dᵢ}` such that:
>
> 1. Their **node sets** are disjoint (no shared holon instances).
> 2. Their **boundaries** are disjoint (no shared ports) or any shared internal stock is **lifted** to the parent boundary in notes.
> 3. No edge in `E` crosses partitions except via explicit `U.Interaction` (not parthood).

**Claim:** Under IND‑LOC, Γ’s fold result is **invariant to local fold order** within and across `{Dᵢ}`.

#### 6.2 Weakest‑link cutset (WLNK)

> **Obligation WLNK‑CUT.**
> Enumerate a **critical set** `C ⊆ V ∪ E` (nodes/edges) such that **failure** (or insufficiency) of any element of `C` makes the aggregation invalid or unsafe in the chosen Γ‑flavour.

**Claim:** For the target property, the result for the whole is bounded by the **minimum** (or tightest cap) across `C`.
Examples:
• Γ\_sys → tensile strength cutset along a load path;
• Γ\_epist → weakest supported premise in a proof spine;
• Γ\_work → availability caps for required inputs across the boundary.

#### 6.3 Monotone coordinates (MONO)

> **Obligation MONO‑AX.**
> Declare the **monotone characteristics** (attributes whose improvement cannot worsen the whole) **for this call**. Specify *how* “improvement” is recognized.

**Claim:** If only monotone characteristics change in the direction of improvement while all else is fixed, the aggregate’s target value cannot degrade.

Examples:
• Γ\_sys → increased component reliability, tighter tolerance;
• Γ\_epist → stronger evidence, higher formality;
• Γ\_method → reduced step duration, stronger step assurance;
• Γ\_time → added non‑overlapping coverage;
• Γ\_work → higher yield η, reduced dissipation.

#### 6.4 Idempotence witness (IDEM)

> **Obligation IDEM‑WIT.**
> Provide the **singleton** case: a subgraph `D₁` with one node and no admissible composition edges.

**Claim:** Γ(D₁) returns that node’s property unchanged.

#### 6.5 Scope & boundary attestations

> **Obligation SCOPE‑1.**
> Affirm `temporalScope(D) ∈ {design, run}` and that all nodes share it.
> **Obligation BOUND‑1.**
> List the **U.Boundary** for each top‑level holon in `V` and record any **U.Interaction** edges that are relevant but not part of `E` (to show cross‑boundary influences were not mis‑typed as parthood).

#### 6.6 Flavour‑specific summary table

| Γ‑flavour            | Independence (IND‑LOC)                                             | WLNK‑CUT (what is “critical”)                         | MONO‑AX (what cannot make worse)                    | IDEM‑WIT                      | Notes                                                         |

| **Γ\_sys**          | Disjoint subassemblies with disjoint interfaces (BIC respected)    | Structural cutset on load/flow paths                  | ↑ component reliability/capacity; tighter bounds    | Single module                 | Use **BIC** to keep interfaces explicit.                      |
| **Γ\_epist**         | Independent argument subgraphs; no premise reuse across partitions | Weakest premise/claim on entailment spine             | ↑ formality; ↑ reliability of sources; ↑ congruence | Single section/lemma          | Apply `Φ(CL_min)` penalty only where mappings/links are weak. |
| **Γ\_ctx / Γ\_method** | Parallel branches truly independent (no hidden state)              | Slowest/least reliable step on the critical path      | ↓ duration; ↑ step assurance; ↑ join soundness      | Single step                   | COMM relaxed to partial orders (NC‑1..3).                     |
| **Γ\_time**          | Non‑overlapping time slices; same carrier identity                 | Missing slice creates a gap (temporal WLNK)           | ↑ coverage; ↑ timestamp precision                   | Single slice                  | Phases must cover the window without overlap.                 |
| **Γ\_work**          | Disjoint boundary partitions; shared stocks lifted to parent       | Availability caps for required inputs across boundary | ↑ yield; ↓ dissipation; ↑ availability              | Single resource with no delta | Keep **Boundary Ledger** with basis and time window.          |

#### 7.1 U.System (assembly & production)

| Aspect           | Example                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Graph**        | `Motor ComponentOf Chassis`; `Harness ComponentOf Motor`; *(for method demo only, outside `D`)* `QC SerialStepOf Seal`; all nodes scope=`run`; BIC declares ports for power, data. |
| **Independence** | Two subassemblies: `{Chassis, Motor, Harness}` and `{Cabin}` with disjoint interfaces.                                                                     |
| **WLNK‑CUT**     | Tensile path through front mount + harness connector; weakest tensile rating caps assembly load rating.                                                    |
| **MONO‑AX**      | Improving mount alloy or connector strain relief cannot reduce system load rating.                                                                         |
| **IDEM‑WIT**     | Standalone chassis as singleton: Γ\_sys returns chassis unchanged.                                                                                        |
| **Routing**      | `SerialStepOf` belongs to Γ\_method; Γ\_sys ignores order and composes structure; Γ\_work separately composes energy/material costs through boundary ports. |

#### 7.2 U.Episteme (paper & dataset)

| Aspect           | Example                                                                                                                                               |

| **Independence** | Two argument branches that do not reuse premises: `{Lemma1 → ProofA}` and `{Background → Discussion}`.                                                |
| **WLNK‑CUT**     | The least supported premise in the entailment path to the main theorem.                                                                               |
| **MONO‑AX**      | Replacing a weak premise with a stronger one or raising CL of a mapping cannot reduce overall credibility.                                            |
| **IDEM‑WIT**     | Single lemma as singleton: Γ\_epist returns it unchanged.                                                                                             |
| **Routing**      | `MemberOf` for CorpusQ is collection structure; not used to average “truth”. Γ\_epist aggregates via min/penalty and produces a SCR for sources. |

### 9) Anti‑pattern diagnostics (before → after)

| Anti‑pattern                     | Symptom                                                        | Replace with                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Collection as stock**          | `Cell_i MemberOf Battery` then summing “capacity” via MemberOf | Use `PortionOf` for capacity partitions; use `ComponentOf` for physical pack assembly; keep MemberOf only for the *set of cells* as a collection holon. |
| **External supplier as part**    | `PowerGrid ComponentOf Plant`                                  | Model `PowerGrid` as an external holon with `U.Interaction` at the plant boundary; keep plant internals as `ComponentOf`.                               |
| **Order encoded as structure**   | `Step2 ComponentOf Step1`                                      | Use `SerialStepOf`/`ParallelFactorOf` and Γ\_method.                                                                                                      |
| **History encoded as structure** | `v2 ComponentOf v1`                                            | Use `PhaseOf` for time slices of the *same* carrier, or a Transformer creating a new holon (A.12) if identity changes.                                  |
| **Mapping as parthood**          | `DigitalTwin ConstituentOf Turbine`                            | Keep the twin as a separate holon; link by `U.Interaction` and value‑level mapping; do not use parthood.                                                |
| **Design/run chimera**           | Mix of CAD nodes and telemetry nodes                           | Split into two graphs (`design` vs `run`) and connect via a Transformer role if needed.                                                                 |

### 10) Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Predictable composition:** Γ‑folds are reproducible and auditable across domains.
* **Cross‑scale clarity:** Resource and time additivity are preserved by routing to Γ\_work and Γ\_time.
* **Safer modelling:** WLNK cutsets surface true constraints; emergence is not “smuggled in”.
* **Didactic simplicity:** A small, fixed edge vocabulary makes reviews and onboarding faster.

**Trade‑offs / mitigations**

* **Up‑front discipline:** Declaring boundaries and independence requires effort.
  *Mitigation:* reuse the Proof Kit templates; keep small, local graphs and compose.
* **Refactoring legacy edges:** Replacing “generic part‑of” with precise relations can be noisy.
  *Mitigation:* use the decision guide (4.4) and anti‑pattern table (9) as a script.

### 11) Rationale (informative)

This pattern operationalizes **A.14 (Mereology Extension)** and **A.15 (Strict Distinction)** for the universal algebra of B.1. +… By limiting `E` to **four** well‑formed **mereological** relations, we prevent the three recurrent category errors: **mapping≠parthood**, **order/time≠structure**, **collection≠stock**. The Proof Kit converts the Quintet from abstract slogans into concrete obligations that engineers can check in everyday models. Γ‑flavours then remain simple and domain‑appropriate, while proofs remain small and reusable.

---

### 12) Relations

* **Builds on:** A.1 **Holonic Foundation**; A.14 **Mereology Extension**; A.15 **Strict Distinction**; A.12 **Transformer Principle**.
* **Constrained by:** B.1 **Universal Γ** and the **Invariant Quintet**.
* **Used by:** B.1.2 **Γ\_sys**, B.1.3 **Γ\_epist**, B.1.4 **Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time**, B.1.5 **Γ\_method**, B.1.6 **Γ\_work**.
* **Triggers:** B.2 **Meta‑Holon Transition (MHT): Recognizing Emergence and Re‑identifying Wholes** when cycles or WLNK violations indicate a new emergent whole.
* **Feeds:** B.3 **Trust & Assurance Calculus (F–G–R with Congruence)** via explicit declaration of monotone characteristics and provenance.

---

> **One‑page takeaway.**
> Keep `D` a **DAG**, pick edges from **four** mereological relations, route **order/time/cost** to their Γ‑flavours, and attach the **four Proof Kit obligations** (IND‑LOC, WLNK‑CUT, MONO‑AX, IDEM‑WIT) with scope/boundary notes.
> Do this, and the Quintet holds with minimal fuss.

### **B.1.2 · System‑specific Aggregation Γ\_sys** \[A]

**► decided‑by: A.14 Advanced Mereology**
**A.14 compliance —** Treat **PortionOf** as Σ‑additive stocks; **ComponentOf** must respect boundary integration (BIC); **PhaseOf** is *not* aggregated here (handled by Γ\_time); mapping/representations are *not* parthood.

#### 1  Purpose

`Γ\_sys` is the **default flavour of the universal aggregation operator** for everything that engineers can touch, weigh or wire‑up: bridges, battery packs, data‑centre racks, container clusters.
It translates the abstract Invariant Quintet into three **physically meaningful fold rules**—*additive, limiting, boolean*—and a **Boundary‑Inheritance Contract** (BIC) that keeps external interfaces tidy. Together they guarantee that holons built with `Γ\_sys` obey conservation laws, expose a clean API surface and pass safety audits without manual patching.

---

#### 2  Context

Kernel § 6 defines `U.System` and states that only a **Calculus** may own an aggregation operator. *Sys‑CAL* (Part C.1) exports `Γ\_sys` as its single builder; other CALs (KD‑CAL, Method‑CAL …) reuse the same quintet but swap in domain rules.
Draft 20 Jul 25 already lists default fold policies (Σ, min, ∨/∧) and a cut‑stable axiom; this pattern turns those snippets into a teachable contract for day‑to‑day system design.

#### 3  Problem (seen on real projects)

| Field failure                                                           | Algebraic root cause                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **“Phantom megawatts”** — energy sums higher than fuel input            | Temperatures averaged, masses summed; operator ignored conservation. |
| **Interface Medusa** — hundreds of dangling ports after integration     | No rule for boundary promotion vs encapsulation.                     |
| **Safety inversion** — upgraded actuator lowered SIL rating of the skid | Intensive property (safety) aggregated by average, not min.          |
| **Audit hairball** — inspector cannot trace which crane load went where | Boundary cuts not stable; provenance leaks.                          |

All four break Pillars *Cross‑Scale Consistency* and *State Explicitness*.

#### 4  Forces

| Force                     | Pull                          | Push                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Physical plausibility** | Sum masses, conserve energy   | **Abstraction** — keep rules domain‑agnostic                 |
| **Interface clarity**     | Present one clean API         | **Fidelity** — expose every critical port                    |
| **Safety conservatism**   | Take worst‑case rating        | **Performance** — allow redundancy gains (via MHT later)     |
| **Parallel build**        | Shard assembly, cache results | **Boundary realism** — stress must still balance across cuts |

#### 5  Solution (conceptual core)

##### 5.1 Operator signature

```
Γ\_sys : (D : DependencyGraph\[U.System\], T : U.TransformerRole (plays `AssemblerRole`)) → E\_eff : U.System
```

* **D** – finite acyclic graph whose nodes share one temporal scope and obey the four DG rules (Pattern B .1.1).
* **T** – physically real external system playing `TransformerRole` (e.g., crane, welding rig).

*Rule of thumb for managers:* *If it adds up in your spreadsheet → Σ; if it caps the system → min; if it is yes/no → logic gate*. Defaults match kernel table “Additive flow / Capacity / Boolean capability” .

##### 5.3 Boundary‑Inheritance Contract (BIC)

For **every external interaction** of every part, `Γ\_sys` forces a deliberate choice:

1. **Promote** — port becomes part of the new system boundary.
2. **Forward** — port remains on the child but is namespaced by the parent.
3. **Encapsulate** — port becomes internal and disappears from public view.

BIC is the antidote to *Interface Medusa*: it prevents silent loss of obligations or explosion of unmanaged endpoints.

##### 5.4 Cut‑Stable Boundary Axiom (reminder)

> Given any declared boundary 𝔅, `Γ\_sys(D,C)` **MUST** leave every across‑𝔅 interaction either identical or transformed by a rule that still satisfies the Quintet.

#### 10 · Rationale (link to modern practice)

* **Model‑Based Systems Engineering (MBSE 2023‑2025):** Tools like Cameo Systems Modeler automated Σ/min logic via “Property Kind” stereotypes—Γ\_sys formalises the same trick.
* **Safety audits:** ISO 26262‑2 Ed 3 explicitly adopts “minimum of ASIL ratings” rule; our min fold embeds it by design.
* **Interface control:** Aerospace ICDs (NASA‑7120.5E updates 2024) require a promotion/forward/encapsulate decision tree identical to BIC.
* **Cloud operations:** Kubernetes 1.30 resource quotas implement additive CPU/memory and min PodDisruptionBudget—industrial proof that the schema scales.

Real‑world convergence across steel, silicon and software shows the rules are not theory nice‑to‑haves; they are what successful projects already do—Γ\_sys just makes it explicit, automatic and auditable.

## **B.1.3 Γ\_epist — Knowledge‑Specific Aggregation** \[A]

> **► decided‑by: A.14 Advanced Mereology**
**A.14 compliance —** Use **ConstituentOf** for semantic parts; **PortionOf** only for quantitative splits of texts/data with declared μ (token/byte, etc.); **PhaseOf** for versions/revisions of MethodDescription/documents; no **ComponentOf** here.

> **Plain‑English headline.**
> **Γ\_epist** composes **epistemic holons** (claims, models, datasets, arguments) into a **single episteme** while preserving **provenance**, applying **conservative trust bounds** (B.3 F/G/R), and penalizing **poor conceptual fit** via **congruence levels (CL)**. It is **not** a physical sum; it is a **semantic and evidential fold**.

### 1) Context

* **Holonic foundation.** In the FPF, a `U.Episteme` is a holon whose identity is **knowledge‑bearing** (A.1). It can be a **statement/claim**, a **model**, a **theory**, a **specification**, a **dataset with semantics**, or a **compiled scholarly artifact**.
* **Strict Distinction (A.15).** We separate:
  **structure** (what the episteme comprises), **order** (argument flow), **time** (versioning/phases), **work** (what was spent to produce/validate it), and **values** (objectives/criteria). Γ\_epist stays in the **structure/semantics** lane and calls out to Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time/Γ\_work when needed.
* **Mereology (A.14).** For knowledge composition we primarily use **ConstituentOf** (logical/semantic parts), **UsageOf/ReferenceTo** (external reliance), and **MemberOf** for **collections** (anthologies, corpora). We do **not** use **ComponentOf** (physical) in Γ\_epist.
  `PhaseOf` handles temporal versions of the **same** episteme; **RoleBearerOf** is irrelevant here because knowledge **does not play a role**—it is **used** by a holon‑in‑role (Transformer) at run‑time (A.12).
* **Assurance (B.3).** Knowledge carries **F**, **G**, **R** (Formality, ClaimScope, Reliability). Integration edges carry **CL** (congruence level) that penalizes poor fit. Γ\_epist **must** preserve provenance and apply **conservative** bounds: no “truth averaging,” no silent context hops. **Obligations here are mode/assurance‑gated per C.2.1.**  # [M‑0]
* **Order/time flavours.** Argument sequences may need **Γ\_ctx** (non‑commutative ordering of premises to conclusion). Knowledge evolution uses **Γ\_time** (versioning, deprecation, update). When composition produces **new closure or supervision** (e.g., explanatory theory emerges), we declare **MHT** (B.2).

---

### 2) Problem

Naive aggregation of knowledge holons causes recurring failures:

1. **Trust inflation by averaging.** Averaging confidences of conflicting claims creates a falsely “reliable” whole; violates **WLNK** and **B.3** conservatism.
2. **Provenance erasure.** Merges that drop sources, methods, or links break **A.10 Evidence Anchoring** and make results unauditable.
3. **Semantic drift.** Folding across mismatched concepts without explicit **mappings** (and their **CL**) yields incoherent composites that look formal but mean nothing.
4. **Order blindness.** Arguments with essential **dependency order** (premise ⇒ lemma ⇒ conclusion) are treated as sets; non‑commutativity is lost and results become non‑reproducible.
5. **Context chimeras.** Combining items across **bounded contexts** (different vocabularies/units/policies) without a **Context Reframe** (B.2) silently corrupts claims and inflates **R**.
6. **Category errors.** Importing **Γ\_sys** rules (e.g., “sum truth,” “avg formality”) into knowledge composition produces physically sounding but epistemically nonsensical models.

### 3) Forces

| Force                                      | Tension                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conservatism vs. Synthesis**             | Keep **reliability** bounded by the weakest supported link ↔ allow genuine explanatory integration when it actually emerges. |
| **Universality vs. Domain nuance**         | One operator across math, science, engineering specs ↔ domain‑specific semantics and evidence patterns differ.               |
| **Provenance fidelity vs. Cognitive load** | Keep the **full trail** of sources and methods ↔ avoid overwhelming authors with bookkeeping.                                |
| **Order/time discipline vs. Flow**         | Respect argument **order** and version **time** ↔ keep composition usable for day‑to‑day synthesis.                          |
| **Parsimony vs. Fit**                      | Small rule set (A.11) ↔ explicit **congruence** penalties and **context** rebasing when needed.                              |

---

### 4) Solution — **Terms, operator family, invariant contract, core rules**

#### 4.1 Terms (didactic recap)

* **U.Episteme** — a knowledge holon. Internally we use a didactic triangle:
  **Object** (what it is about), **Concept** (theory/model/claim structure), **Symbol** (SCR carriers: text, code, figures, datasets).
* **Evidence/Provenance Graph** — edges like **evidences**, **derivesFrom**, **usesMethod**, **isMeasuredBy** with anchors (A.10).
* **Mapping edge** — a typed relation between conceptual vocabularies (e.g., ontology alignment, unit conversion) with a **CL** score (0…3/4 per A.15/B.3 convention).
* **SCR** — a `U.SCR` that lists all symbol carriers included in the aggregate; **never dropped**.
* **Bounded context** — a modelling contract (vocabulary/units/policy). Crossing it requires **Context Reframe** (B.2) or explicit mappings with CL.

> **Didactic reminders.**
> • Knowledge does **not** “act.” Transformers (A.12) **use** knowledge.
> • **MemberOf** creates **collections**; it is not a semantic argument link. Use **ConstituentOf** for logical/evidential composition.
> • **PhaseOf** is for **versions** of the same episteme; if identity, boundary, or context re‑anchor, declare **MHT**.

---

#### 4.2 The operator family (companion flavours)

To keep **design vs run** clean (A.15), Γ\_epist has two companion flavours that share the same algebra but serve different moments:

1. **Synthesis (design‑time)** — fold epistemes into a **draft aggregate**

```
Γ_epist^synth : ( D_know : DependencyGraph< U.Episteme >,
                  T      : U.TransformerRole ) → U.Episteme
```

* **Domain.** `D_know` uses **ConstituentOf**, **UsageOf/ReferenceTo**, **evidences/derivesFrom**, optional **MemberOf** for collections.
 * **Result.** A **composite episteme** whose Object/Concept/Symbol components are assembled; **provenance and SCR are preserved**; F/G/R/CL are provisionally computed for later assurance.   **Gating:** at **M‑mode** only tuple placeholders are required; numeric scoring may be omitted (**\[M‑0/M‑1]**). At **F‑mode** the tuple **MUST** be computable in‑Context (**\[F‑*,L1+]**).  # [M/F]

2. **Compile (run‑time)** — produce the **released artifact** in a bounded context

```
Γ_epist^compile : ( E_synth : U.Episteme,
                    Ctx     : BoundedContext,
                    T       : U.TransformerRole ) → U.Episteme
```

* **Domain.** A synthesized episteme and a **target context** (journal, standard, program spec).
* **Result.** A **context‑anchored** episteme (e.g., published paper/spec) whose **mappings to the context vocabulary** are explicit and carry **CL**; assurance will reference this context baseline (B.3).

**Relationship to Γ\_ctx / Γ\_time.**
If the knowledge fold explicitly depends on **argument order** (e.g., derivation), the internal fold uses **Γ\_ctx** for the sequence. If a **temporal storyline** (updates, retractions) is important, use **Γ\_time** to slice versions; **Γ\_epist** then composes the **current slice**. If composition yields **new explanatory closure** beyond WLNK/CL, declare **MHT** (B.2).

---

#### 4.3 Invariant contract (how the Quintet applies; **math by level**)

* **IDEM (Idempotence).** Folding a single episteme returns itself; no accidental “upgrade.”
* **COMM/LOC (Local commutativity / locality).** For **independent** subgraphs (no logical/evidential dependency), fold order/location is irrelevant; when dependencies exist, **Γ\_ctx** controls order explicitly.
* **WLNK (Weakest‑link bound).** Aggregate **Reliability (R)** is bounded by the **weakest supported link** along any justification path, **after** considering the **lowest CL** on mappings used by that path.
* **MONO (Monotonicity).** Strengthening a part (raising **R** with valid evidence or raising **CL** on a needed mapping) cannot lower aggregate **R**. Adding **contradictory** evidence is **not** an improvement; it triggers conflict handling (below), not MONO.

2. **Reliability fold.** Along any support spine, **R\_raw = min\_i R\_i**; apply congruence penalty Φ(CL\_min) → **R\_eff = max(0, R\_raw − Φ(CL\_min))**.  *No averaging; weakest‑link.*  
   **Math by level:**  
   – **\[M‑0/M‑1]** allow **ordinal** comparisons only (no arithmetic on R); Φ may be stated qualitatively (“low/med/high”).  
   – **\[M‑2/L1]** require numeric Φ table (default in §4.4) and reproducibility tag on empirical edges.  
   – **\[F‑*,L1/L2]** require formal derivability of the fold rules from LOG‑CAL; constructive mode annotates `proof.kind=constructive`.  # [M/F]

#### 4.4 Core rules for epistemic aggregation (design‑time synthesis)

When computing **Γ\_epist^synth(D\_know, T)**:

1. **Provenance preservation.**
   The **provenance/evidence graph** is **unioned with de‑duplication**; every claim in the aggregate remains traceable to its sources and methods. No source, method, or dataset that supports a retained claim may be dropped.

2. **SCR construction.**
   Build a **U.SCR** that lists all symbol carriers (texts, code, figures, datasets) that materially participate in the aggregate. Provenance nodes must be mappable to SCR entries.

3. **Object alignment.**
   Determine a **common Object** via domain taxonomy (e.g., **least common ancestor**) or create a `U.CompositeEntity` with explicit **mappings**. Record **CL** for each mapping; **do not** silently merge homonyms.

4. **Concept integration with CL penalty.**
   Compute provisional **F/G/R** of the aggregate:

   * **F\_eff** = min(F\_i) (formality is as strong as the least formal constituent actually used).
   * **G\_eff** = function of coverage; typically **monotone** in included scope, capped by weakest definitional fit.
   * **R\_eff** = min over justification paths of { R\_i along the path } **penalized** by the lowest **CL** used by that path: `R_eff := max(0, min_path( min_claimR(path) − Φ(CL_min(path)) ))`, where **Φ** is the normative penalty function defined below.
      If a mapping with **CL < threshold** is essential to a path, mark the claim **provisional**.
 5. **Normative Penalty Function Φ (v1.0)**
The penalty function `Φ` quantifies the loss of reliability due to poor conceptual alignment between parts.

| Congruence Level `CL_min` | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Penalty Φ(CL_min)** | 1.5 | 1.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 |

+*A domain profile **MAY** provide an alternative table but **MUST** preserve monotonic decrease (a lower `CL` cannot have a smaller penalty). The default values are derived from empirical fits in KD-CAL Bench 0.3.*

 6. **Conflict detection (no averaging).**
    Detect contradictions (e.g., `p` and `¬p` with overlapping scope). Do **not** average. Either (i) **separate** by context or scope (bounded contexts; Γ\_time slices), (ii) mark **provisional** with explicit conflict edges, or (iii) if resolution yields **new closure**, consider **MHT**.

7. **Handling of Axiomatic vs. Postulative Epistemes**
   In alignment with ADR-028, the computation of `R_eff` depends on the episteme's declared `mode`.

*   For an input episteme `E_i` with **`mode: axiomatic`**, empirical `R` is N/A; take `R_i_eff = F_i`. **Tag:** `line=formal`.  # [F‑*]
*   For **`mode: postulative`**, use declared `R_i` with decay; **Tag:** `line=empirical`.  # [M‑1/M‑2/F]
*   The aggregate `E_eff` **MUST** also declare a mode. If all inputs are `axiomatic`, the output is `axiomatic`. If any input is `postulative`, the output **MUST** be `postulative`.
*   **Constructive note.** Under **F‑constructive**, equivalence claims use **isomorphism/equivalence** in the chosen UF library; **CL=2** means proof‑reconstructed alignment, not mere model‑theoretic appeal.  # [F‑constructive]
 
7. **Order‑aware arguments (optional).**
   If the argument requires premise ordering, embed a **Γ\_ctx** fold inside Γ\_epist; record the **OrderSpec** for reproducibility (NC‑1..3).
   **Gating:** OrderSpec is **recommended** at **M‑1** and **required** at **M‑2/F**.  # [M‑1→F]

8. **No costs here.**
   Any compute/collection effort is **Γ\_work**; attach references but do not mix costs into epistemic aggregation.

#### 4.5 Core rules for compilation (run‑time context anchoring)

When computing **Γ\_epist^compile(E\_synth, Ctx, T)**:

1. **Context bindings.**  # [M‑1+]
   Map all operative concepts/units/claims into **Ctx**; record mappings and their **CL**. If the rebase changes boundary/objective of the episteme (e.g., from descriptive compendium to explanatory theory with commitments), **declare Context Reframe (MHT)** per B.2.

2. **Assurance baseline (gated).**  
   Recalculate the **assurance tuple** (B.3) **in Ctx**: F and R may change with formalization and mapping penalties; G is re‑expressed in Ctx’s scope.  
   **Gating:**  
* **\[M‑0]** narrative justification only;  
* **\[M‑1]** qualitative tuples allowed;  
* **\[M‑2/L1]** numeric tuple required;  
* **\[F‑*/L2]** tuple **and** proof obligations on weight/penalty model selection.  # [M/F]

3. **Release SCR.**
 Produce RSCR with carrier hashes; at **L2** require independent re‑hash verification.  # [M‑1/L2]

4. **Order/time hooks.**
   If the compiled artifact includes an internal derivation, carry the **OrderSpec**; if it codifies a specific **time slice** of evolving knowledge, link back to the **Γ\_time** slice used.

### 5) Archetypal grounding (worked, didactic)

#### 5.1 Episteme — **Meta‑analysis into a guidance statement**

* **Inputs (U.Episteme):**
  `E₁` randomized trial (R=0.84, F=3, G=medium), `E₂` observational study (R=0.55, F=2, G=wide), `E₃` mechanistic model (R=0.60, F=3, G=narrow).
  Mappings: dosage units (mg ↔ IU), outcome definitions (pain scale variants), each with declared **CL** (e.g., unit mapping CL=3, outcome alignment CL=2).

* **Γ\_epist^synth:**

  * **Provenance preservation:** all study protocols, datasets, analysis scripts listed in the **SCR**.
  * **Object alignment:** “acute low‑back pain within 6 weeks” via taxonomy LCA; non‑aligned chronic cohorts excluded or mapped with low CL and flagged.
  * **Concept integration:** compute provisional `R_eff` along each justification path, penalized by \*\*Φ(CL\_min(path))`; aggregate `R\_eff\` = min over paths.
  * **Conflict handling:** `E₂` contradicts `E₁` in a subgroup; kept as **provisional** with explicit conflict edge and scope note (different baseline severity).

* **Γ\_epist^compile (journal context):**
  Map outcomes to journal’s required measure, recalc F/G/R with mapping penalties; produce release **SCR** (hashes, versions) and context baseline.
  Result: “Guidance Statement v1.0” with conservative `R`.

* **Why not averaging?**
  Averaging would inflate `R` and hide low‑CL outcome mappings; Γ\_epist enforces pathwise **min** + **CL** penalty.

---

#### 5.2 Episteme — **Safety case from heterogeneous evidence**

* **Inputs:** requirement spec (F=3, R=0.7), hazard analysis (F=2, R=0.6), test logs (F=1, R=0.8), formal proof of controller property (F=3, R=0.9).

* **Γ\_epist^synth:**

  * Provenance union; **SCR** includes requirements, proof artifact, test datasets.
  * Concept integration: controller proof applies only under assumptions A; test logs violate A in edge case → **CL** low for mapping “test scenario ≡ proof assumption.”
  * `R_eff` bounded by the weakest justification path after **Φ(CL\_min)**; claim on “system‑level safety” marked **provisional** until assumption alignment is demonstrated.

* **Γ\_epist^compile (certification context):**
  Context re‑base to regulatory vocabulary; if the re‑base changes objective/boundary (e.g., from internal assurance to public certification), consider **MHT (Context Reframe)** per B.2.

### 6) Proof obligations (normative)

**At synthesis (Γ\_epist^synth):**

1. **PO‑SYN‑PROV.** The **provenance/evidence graph** MUST be preserved (union with de‑duplication); every retained claim is traceable to sources/methods in the **SCR**.
2. **PO‑SYN‑OBJ.** The **Object** MUST be identified (single subject via LCA or explicit `U.CompositeEntity`) with declared **mappings** and their **CL**.
3. **PO‑SYN‑CL.** All **mapping edges** that bridge semantics/units MUST carry **CL**; the chosen penalty **Φ** MUST be monotone in CL (lower CL ⇒ higher penalty). Thresholds for marking **provisional** MUST be stated.
4. **PO‑SYN‑R.** `R_eff` MUST be computed as **min over justification paths** of (claim reliabilities along the path **minus** `Φ(CL_min(path))`). No arithmetic mean is allowed for reliability.
5. **PO‑SYN‑CONFLICT.** Contradictions MUST be either (i) separated by context/scope, (ii) marked as **provisional** with explicit conflict edges, or (iii) escalated to **MHT** if resolution yields new explanatory closure.
6. **PO‑SYN‑ORDER.** If order matters, the **OrderSpec** MUST be recorded and Γ\_ctx **NC‑1..3** (determinism, context hash, partial‑order soundness) MUST hold.
7. **PO‑SYN‑NOWORK.** Resource spending, yields, and dissipation MUST NOT be computed here; instead, attach references to the aligned **Γ\_work** composition.

**At compilation (Γ\_epist^compile):**

1. **PO‑COMP‑CTX.** The target **bounded context** MUST be declared; all active concepts MUST be mapped with **CL**; context vocabulary/units recorded.
2. **PO‑COMP‑ASSUR.** The assurance tuple (F/G/R) MUST be recomputed **in the target context** with the applied **CL penalties**.
3. **PO‑COMP‑REL.** A **release‑grade SCR** (hashes, versions, dates) MUST be produced.
4. **PO‑COMP‑MHT.** If the compilation re‑anchors **boundary**, **objective**, or **identity** (e.g., from compendium to explanatory theory), an **MHT (Context Reframe)** MUST be declared with a Promotion Record (B.2).
5. **PO‑COMP‑ORDER/TIME.** If derivational order or a specific time slice is essential, the **OrderSpec** and the **Γ\_time** slice MUST be referenced.

### 7) Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ID            | Requirement                                                                                                                                                         | Purpose                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **CC‑B1.3.1** | Inputs to Γ\_epist MUST be `U.Episteme` holons; **ComponentOf** is forbidden; use **ConstituentOf / UsageOf / ReferenceTo**; **MemberOf** only for **collections**. | Prevent category errors.       |
| **CC‑B1.3.2** | Provenance and **SCR** MUST be preserved in the aggregate; dropping sources or methods is non‑conformant.                                                      | Enforce evidence anchoring.    |
| **CC‑B1.3.3** | Aggregate **R** MUST follow the **pathwise min** rule with **Φ(CL\_min)** penalties; no averaging of reliability.                                                   | Guard conservatism (WLNK).     |
| **CC‑B1.3.4** | Contradictions MUST NOT be smoothed by arithmetic; handle by **scope separation**, **provisional** status, or **MHT**.                                              | Keep incoherence visible.      |
| **CC‑B1.3.5** | Every `U.Episteme` serving as an input to `Γ_epist` **MUST** declare its `mode` (`axiomatic` or `postulative`). An aggregate holon's mode **MUST** be `postulative` if any of its constituents is `postulative`. | Prevent category errors in reliability calculation. |
| **CC‑B1.3.6** | Crossing bounded contexts requires either **explicit mappings with CL** or an **MHT (Context Reframe)**.                                                            | Make context explicit.         |
| **CC‑B1.3.7** | If order matters, Γ\_ctx **NC‑1..3** MUST hold; if versions matter, the **Γ\_time** slice MUST be identified.                                                       | Preserve order/time integrity. |
| **CC‑B1.3.8** | Design‑time **synthesis** and run‑time **compilation** MUST NOT be conflated; use the appropriate flavour.                                                          | Maintain A.15 separation.      |

### 8) Anti‑patterns & repairs

| Anti‑pattern             | Symptom                                           | Repair                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Truth‑averaging**      | Averaging confidence of conflicting claims        | Apply **pathwise min** with **CL** penalties; separate scopes or mark **provisional**.     |
| **Provenance amnesia**   | Sources/methods disappear in the aggregate        | Rebuild **SCR**; re‑run Γ\_epist with provenance union.                               |
| **Homonym merge**        | Different concepts with same name silently merged | Insert **mapping edges** with CL; if CL too low, split by context or mark **provisional**. |
| **Context hop**          | Mixed units/vocabularies without declaration      | Declare **bounded context** and mappings; if purpose changes, use **MHT**.                 |
| **Version soup**         | Mixed time slices without clarity                 | Use **Γ\_time** to slice; compose current slice only; link others explicitly.              |
| **Work stuffing**        | Compute/curation cost blended into reliability    | Move costs to **Γ\_work**; keep R based on evidence, not spend.                            |
| **Orderless proof**      | Derivation steps treated as a set                 | Add **OrderSpec**; compose with Γ\_ctx inside Γ\_epist.                                    |
| **Synergy by narrative** | “New theory” claimed without BOSC evidence        | If closure/supervision actually emerges, declare **MHT**; otherwise lower claims.          |

---

### 9) Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Auditability by construction.** Every retained claim remains tied to its sources; **SCR** guarantees reconstructability.
* **Safe synthesis.** **R** cannot be inflated; **CL penalties** make conceptual misfit explicit.
* **Context‑aware releases.** Compiled artifacts are aligned with a declared context; cross‑context reuse is principled.
* **Didactic clarity.** Separates **semantic folding** (Γ\_epist) from **order** (Γ\_ctx), **time** (Γ\_time), **spend** (Γ\_work), and **emergence** (B.2).

**Trade‑offs**

* **Mapping overhead.** Declaring mappings and **CL** costs time; it prevents silent incoherence.
* **Conservative stance.** Results may look pessimistic; this is deliberate (WLNK). Use **MHT** only for genuine explanatory closure.

---

### 10) Rationale (informative)

* **Epistemic composition is not physical addition.** Reliability must be bounded by the **weakest justified path**, not averaged; conceptual misalignment must **reduce** confidence, not be ignored.
* **Provenance is part of meaning.** Dropping sources/methods changes what the episteme **is**; Γ\_epist treats provenance and **SCR** as first‑class.
* **Context matters.** Bounded contexts structure practice; formal **Context Reframe (MHT)** prevents quiet re‑interpretations of claims.
* **Parsimony with power.** A small set of rules (provenance preservation, CL‑penalized pathwise min, order/time hooks, context discipline) is enough to model scientific and engineering knowledge without importing domain‑specific tool jargon.

---

### 11) Relations

* **Builds on:** A.12 (Transformer Role—compilers/editors enact), A.14 (Mereology Extension—ConstituentOf/MemberOf/PhaseOf usage), A.15 (Strict Distinction).
* **Coordinates with:** B.1.1 (Proof kit), B.1.4 (Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time inside knowledge folds), B.1.6 (Γ\_work for compute/collection spend).
* **Triggers/Complements:** B.2 (MHT) when explanatory closure or context re‑base creates a **new whole** (theory, standard).
* **Feeds:** B.3 (Assurance) — `F/G/R` and **CL** baselines computed here become inputs to trust calculations.

> **One‑sentence takeaway.**
> **Γ\_epist** preserves provenance, penalizes poor conceptual fit, forbids reliability averaging, and makes context explicit—so that knowledge aggregates are conservative, auditable, and genuinely coherent.

## **B.1.4 Contextual & Temporal Aggregation (Γ\_ctx & Γ\_time)** \[A]

> **► decided‑by: A.14 Advanced Mereology**
**A.14 compliance —** **Γ\_ctx** relies on **SerialStepOf/ParallelFactorOf** (order semantics); **Γ\_time** composes **PhaseOf** slices of the *same* carrier with coverage/no‑overlap; **PortionOf** is orthogonal (quantities within steps), mappings are not parthood.

> **Plain‑English headline.**
> Use **Γ\_ctx** when *the order of steps changes meaning*.
> Use **Γ\_time** when *we are aggregating the same carrier across a timeline*.

### 1) Context

The universal algebra **Γ** (B.1) assumes local commutativity and locality for most structures. But many real‑world compositions are **not** order‑indifferent (recipes, proofs that unfold by steps, manufacturing routes), and many composites are **nothing but** a history (asset lifecycle, model revisions, experiment runs). For these cases FPF offers two universal flavours:


* **Γ\_ctx** — **procedural composition** (where SerialStepOf / ParallelFactorOf edges are present; see B.1.5 Γ_method for typing and joins; A.14 governs only mereological edges such as PortionOf/PhaseOf).
**Γ\_time** — *temporal* aggregation for **phase composition of the same carrier** (where `PhaseOf` edges from **A.14** are present).

Both flavours **inherit WLNK and MONO** from the Quintet (B.1) and remain compatible with **A.12** (Transformer Principle) and **A.15** (Strict Distinction): they do *order* and *time*, not structure, mapping, or cost.

---

### 2) Problem

Forcing sequential or temporal phenomena through the default, order‑indifferent Γ leads to recurring failures:

1. **Semantic erasure:** Treating `SerialStepOf` as if it were structural parthood flattens workflows; swapping steps silently changes meaning.
2. **Causal paradoxes:** Aggregating time slices as if they were unordered parts lets effects precede causes, or hides missing epochs.
3. **Locality violations:** Hidden shared state between “parallel” branches breaks reproducibility; independent branches were not actually independent.
4. **Design/run conflation:** Mixing design‑time plans and run‑time histories in one fold produces “chimeras” that neither simulate nor audit reality.

---

### 3) Forces

| Force                                 | Tension                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Order fidelity vs. Simplicity**     | Preserve step order (non‑COMM) ↔ Keep reasoning lightweight and composable.                                      |
| **Temporal coverage vs. Flexibility** | Ensure gap/overlap discipline across phases ↔ Allow rolling windows and partial histories.                       |
| **Locality vs. Concurrency**          | Keep branches deterministic and independent ↔ Exploit parallelism where it is safe.                              |
| **Universality vs. Fit**              | One pattern for systems and epistemes ↔ Different edge types (`SerialStepOf`, `PhaseOf`) and different carriers. |

---

### 4) Solution — **Part 1: What these flavours are, and when to use them**

#### 4.1 Two flavours at a glance (edge discipline)

| Flavour                                      | You use it when…                                                      | Edge kinds in `D`                                         | Typical carrier                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Γ\_ctx** *(Contextual / order‑sensitive)*  | The **sequence** of steps changes the outcome or meaning.             | `SerialStepOf`, `ParallelFactorOf` (no structural substitution) | `U.Method` (procedures, work processes), also order‑bound argument chains in `U.Episteme` |
| **Γ\_time** *(Temporal / phase aggregation)* | You reconstruct a **timeline** of the **same** holon (phases/slices). | `PhaseOf` of a single carrier (non‑overlapping)                 | Any `U.Holon` with identity across time (systems or epistemes)             |

> **Strict Distinction (A.15) reminder.**
> • Structural inclusion → **Γ\_sys** (ComponentOf / ConstituentOf).
> • Order of actions → **Γ\_ctx** (and its specialisation **Γ\_method**).
> • History of the same thing → **Γ\_time** (PhaseOf).
> • Resource spending → **Γ\_work**.
> • Mappings / representations → value‑level links or `U.Interaction`, not parthood.

---

#### 4.2 Operator signatures (normative)

**Γ\_ctx — Contextual / Order‑Sensitive Aggregation**

```
Γ\_ctx : (D_ctx : DependencyGraph, σ : OrderSpec, T : U.TransformerRole) → H′ : U.Holon
```

* **D\_ctx:** a DAG whose **edges are only** `SerialStepOf` / `ParallelFactorOf`.
* **σ (OrderSpec):** an explicit **partial order** (or total order) compatible with `D_ctx` that disambiguates how branches compose and where joins occur.
* **T:** the transformer that performs the material act of sequencing/combining steps (A.12).
* **Output H′:** typically a `U.Method` holon, but may be any holon whose identity is defined by stepwise construction.

**Γ\_time — Temporal / Phase Aggregation**

```
Γ\_time : (D_time : DependencyGraph, τ : TimeWindow, T : U.TransformerRole) → H′ : U.Holon
```

* **D\_time:** a DAG whose **edges are only** `PhaseOf`, all phases referring to the **same carrier** identity.
* **τ:** the declared time window to be covered by the aggregation.
* **T:** the transformer that composes the timeline (A.12).
* **Output H′:** the holon reconstructed over τ (system lifecycle, theory revision history, dataset growth, etc.).

---

#### 4.3 Adapted invariants (what replaces COMM/LOC)

Both flavours **keep** IDEM, WLNK, MONO from B.1. They **replace** COMM/LOC by discipline specific to order and time.

**For Γ\_ctx (NC‑invariants):**

* **NC‑1 — Determinism under σ.** Given the same `D_ctx` and `σ`, the fold yields the same result.
* **NC‑2 — Context identifier.** The result **SHALL** record an unambiguous identifier of `σ` (e.g., a canonical text or digest) as part of the aggregation record.
* **NC‑3 — Partial‑Order Soundness.** Any topological sort consistent with `σ` and with declared independence (below) yields the same result; independent branches may fold in parallel.

**For Γ\_time (T‑invariants):**

* **T‑1 — Temporal Idempotence.** A single phase/slice folds to itself.
* **T‑2 — Chronological Discipline.** Phases must be composed in non‑decreasing time consistent with carrier identity; reversing adjacent slices is forbidden.
* **T‑3 — Coverage.** The union of phase intervals equals the declared `τ`, with **no overlaps** and **no unexplained gaps**. Gaps/overlaps require explicit justification (e.g., measurement resolution or MHT).

> **Why we keep WLNK and MONO.**
> Even with order/time, the whole cannot be safer or more reliable than the bottleneck step/phase (WLNK), and improving a step/phase on declared monotone characteristics cannot make the whole worse (MONO).

---

#### 4.4 Guards that make the folds provable

**For Γ\_ctx**

1. **Edge discipline:** only `SerialStepOf` / `ParallelFactorOf`.
2. **OrderSpec σ:** explicit partial order; joins must have well‑typed inputs/outputs (see B.1.5 for join soundness).
3. **Independence declaration:** if you claim parallel folds commute locally, declare **which branches are independent** (no hidden shared state or side‑effects).
4. **Scope:** single `temporalScope` (design *or* run) for all nodes; do not mix plans with histories.
5. **Boundary note:** if steps cross holon boundaries, record the relevant `U.Interaction`—do not recast it as parthood.

**For Γ\_time**

1. **Same carrier:** all phases are `PhaseOf` the **same** holon identity; identity change implies a Transformer producing a *new* holon.
2. **Non‑overlap / coverage:** phase intervals are disjoint and cover `τ`; if not, specify how resolution limits or business rules justify the pattern.
3. **Scope:** single `temporalScope`; design‑time hypothetical timelines and run‑time actual logs are kept separate.
4. **Boundary note:** if Work across boundaries is reported for phases, route resource statements to **Γ\_work**; Γ\_time itself does not invent costs.

---

#### 4.5 Selection checklist (didactic quick guide)

* **Does swapping two steps change meaning or safety?** → **Γ\_ctx**.
* **Is this the same entity evolving over time?** → **Γ\_time**.
* **Is it a physical assembly or conceptual inclusion?** → **Γ\_sys**.
* **Is it a “who belongs to this collective” question?** → **MemberOf** + (future) **Γ\_collective**.
* **Do you need durations, critical paths, and joins?** → **Γ\_method** (specialisation of **Γ\_ctx**).
* **Do you need resource spending across a boundary?** → **Γ\_work** (orthogonal; can be used together with Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time).

---

#### 4.6 Didactic contrasts (one‑liners)

* **Γ\_sys vs Γ\_ctx:** Γ\_sys composes *what the whole is*; Γ\_ctx composes *how it is done*.
* **Γ\_ctx vs Γ\_method:** Γ\_method is Γ\_ctx **plus** step‑specific rules (durations, joins, capability typing).
* **Γ\_time vs Γ\_ctx:** Γ\_time composes *phases of the same carrier*; Γ\_ctx composes *different steps that realise a procedure*.
* **Γ\_time vs Γ\_work:** Γ\_time composes *history*; Γ\_work accounts *costs across a boundary* for each phase.

### 5) Proof Kit (ready‑to‑reuse obligations for Γ\_ctx / Γ\_time)

This Proof Kit instantiates the generic obligations from **B.1.1 §6** for the order/time flavours. Attach these items whenever you call Γ\_ctx or Γ\_time on a `DependencyGraph D`.

#### 5.1 Γ\_ctx obligations

* **CTX‑IND (Independence & Joins).**
  Declare **which branches are independent** (no hidden shared state, no side‑effects that leak across branches). For every **join**, state a **join‑soundness condition** (compatible input/output types and pre/postconditions).
  *Claim:* Under CTX‑IND, parallel folds of independent branches commute locally; any topological sort consistent with `σ` yields the same result (NC‑3).

* **CTX‑ORD (OrderSpec).**
  Provide the **OrderSpec `σ`** as a partial order (or total order) text, including where joins occur.
  *Claim:* Given `D_ctx` and `σ`, the fold is deterministic (NC‑1) and carries a stable **context identifier** (NC‑2).

* **CTX‑WLNK (Critical Path).**
  Identify the **critical path** (or a cutset) whose weakest step caps the property of the whole: throughput, safety, assurance, etc.
  *Claim:* The whole is bounded by the weakest element along the critical path (WLNK).

* **CTX‑MONO (Monotone characteristics).**
  List the characteristics that cannot degrade the whole when improved: e.g., ↓ step duration, ↓ error rate, ↑ step reliability, ↑ join soundness.
  *Claim:* Improving only monotone characteristics cannot make the aggregated process worse (MONO).

* **CTX‑IDEM (Singleton).**
  Provide the one‑step singleton witness: Γ\_ctx of a single `SerialStepOf`‑free node returns that step unchanged (IDEM).

* **CTX‑SCOPE/BOUND.**
  Affirm a **single temporalScope** (`design` or `run`) and list any **U.Interaction** that crosses a holon boundary (do not recast it as parthood).

#### 5.2 Γ\_time obligations

* **TIME‑CARR (Carrier Identity).**
  State explicitly the **carrier holon** whose history is being reconstructed.
  *Claim:* All `PhaseOf` arcs refer to the same carrier; if identity changes, model a Transformer producing a new holon (A.12), not another phase.

* **TIME‑COV (Coverage & Non‑overlap).**
  Provide the target **TimeWindow τ** and the list of phases with intervals; justify any gaps or overlaps (resolution limits, business rules).
  *Claim:* Phases cover τ without overlap; otherwise the fold is not admissible (T‑3).

* **TIME‑ORD (Chronological Discipline).**
  Assert that fold order is non‑decreasing in time; reversing adjacent slices is forbidden.
  *Claim:* Temporal idempotence holds on a single slice, and chronological composition preserves consistency (T‑1, T‑2).

* **TIME‑WLNK (Temporal Weakest‑Link).**
  Identify time‑critical constraints: missing essential phases, minimal sampling resolution, minimal integrity of a crucial epoch.
  *Claim:* The property of the whole (over τ) is capped by the weakest phase/epoch.

* **TIME‑MONO (Monotone characteristics).**
  List monotone improvements: ↑ coverage, ↑ timestamp precision, ↑ measurement accuracy, ↑ calibration quality.
  *Claim:* Such improvements cannot degrade the aggregate.

* **TIME‑SCOPE/BOUND.**
  Keep design‑time hypothetical timelines and run‑time actual logs separate; route resource statements for phases to **Γ\_work** (not Γ\_time).

---

### 6) Archetypal grounding (worked micro‑examples)

Use these as templates; each fits on a page and references the obligations above.

#### 6.1 **Γ\_ctx — U.System (manufacturing route)**

* **Graph:** `Prep SerialStepOf Weld SerialStepOf Paint`; `QC ParallelFactorOf Paint` with a join; scope=`run`.
* **CTX‑IND:** `QC` is independent of `Prep/Weld` state; join requires “painted & inspected” flags aligned.
* **CTX‑ORD:** `σ` is total: `Prep → Weld → Paint`; `QC` runs in parallel with `Paint`, joins at `Finish`.
* **CTX‑WLNK:** Slowest/least reliable step on the critical path caps throughput and assurance.
* **CTX‑MONO:** ↓ duration of `Weld`; ↑ join condition coverage → cannot reduce overall safety.
* **Routing:** Costs/energy are handled per step with **Γ\_work**; structure of subassemblies remains in **Γ\_sys**.

#### 6.2 **Γ\_ctx — U.Episteme (order‑bound argument)**

* **Graph:** `PremiseA SerialStepOf LemmaB SerialStepOf Conclusion`; `Background ParallelFactorOf PremiseA`.
* **CTX‑IND:** `Background` does not alter `LemmaB` assumptions; join checks entailment preconditions.
* **CTX‑WLNK:** Weakest premise on the entailment spine caps the argument’s reliability.
* **SCR:** Γ\_epist on the final `Conclusion` produces a SCR linking every source; Γ\_ctx assures the order.

#### 6.3 **Γ\_time — U.System (asset lifecycle)**

* **Carrier:** *This* turbine T‑17.
* **Phases:** `Install [t0,t1)`, `Operate v1 [t1,t2)`, `Overhaul [t2,t3)`, `Operate v2 [t3,t4)`.
* **TIME‑COV:** Intervals cover `[t0,t4)` with no overlap; a gap between `t2` and `t2+ε` is justified as clock resolution.
* **TIME‑WLNK:** The weakest reliability epoch caps lifetime MTTF claimed for `[t0,t4)`.
* **Routing:** Work/energy footprints per phase via **Γ\_work**; structural upgrades (new rotor) are Transformers (A.12), not phases, if identity changes.

#### 6.4 **Γ\_time — U.Episteme (paper revisions)**

* **Carrier:** *This* paper P.
* **Phases:** `Draft v1`, `Review v2`, `Camera‑ready v3`.
* **TIME‑ORD/COV:** Non‑overlapping versions covering the documented interval; v3 supersedes v2, not a parallel branch.
* **TIME‑WLNK:** If v2 violated a key citation, overall reliability over `[v1,v3]` is capped by that epoch unless the violation is explicitly retracted and corrected in v3 (documented change).
* **Routing:** Γ\_epist aggregates the conceptual whole at each version; Γ\_time composes the revision history.

### 8) Anti‑patterns and their fixes

| Anti‑pattern                         | Symptom                                                     | Fix                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structure‑as‑sequence**            | `StepB ComponentOf StepA` to force an order                 | Use `SerialStepOf` (Γ\_ctx) and an explicit `σ` with a join condition if needed.                                        |
| **History‑as‑structure**             | `v2 ComponentOf v1`                                         | Use `PhaseOf`; if identity actually changed, model a Transformer (A.12) producing a new holon.                          |
| **Parallelism without independence** | Declaring `ParallelFactorOf` but sharing hidden state       | Either declare the shared state as an interface and remove independence, or refactor so branches are truly independent. |
| **Overlapping phases**               | Two `PhaseOf` intervals for the same carrier overlap        | Split the intervals or justify overlap as measurement resolution; otherwise fold is invalid.                            |
| **Design/run chimera**               | Mixing run logs with design plan in one Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time fold | Split into two graphs by scope; relate through a Transformer or mapping at value level.                                 |
| **Cost in Γ\_time**                  | Trying to sum energy in Γ\_time                             | Route costs to Γ\_work per phase; Γ\_time composes history, not expenditure.                                            |

---

### 9) Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Semantic fidelity:** Order and history are first‑class; no more flattening sequential logic or erasing temporal causality.
* **Auditable determinism:** An explicit `σ`/`τ` and independence/coverage declarations make folds reproducible and reviewable.
* **Safe parallelism:** Partial‑order soundness preserves determinism while exploiting concurrency where it is actually safe.
* **Clean separation of concerns:** Structure (Γ\_sys/Γ\_epist), order (Γ\_ctx/Γ\_method), time (Γ\_time), and cost (Γ\_work) no longer interfere.

**Trade‑offs / mitigations**

* **Extra declarations:** Independence, joins, and coverage require up‑front articulation.
  *Mitigation:* reuse the Proof Kit forms; adopt the decision checklist from Part 1 §4.5.
* **Limited parallelism:** Where branches are not independent, concurrency must be curtailed.
  *Mitigation:* regroup steps; elevate shared state to explicit interfaces.

---

### 10) Rationale (informative)

This pattern implements **A.15’s ordered relations** (`SerialStepOf`, `ParallelFactorOf`) and leverages **A.14’s `PhaseOf`** for timeline; consistent with **Strict Distinction**: order and time are not structure, and costs are not history. The adapted invariants (NC‑1..3 and T‑1..3) give precise replacements for COMM/LOC where these do not hold, while retaining WLNK and MONO. The result is a small, stable interface that matches how engineers and researchers already argue about procedures and histories, without importing domain‑specific notations into the kernel.

---

### 11) Relations

* **Builds on:** B.1 (Universal Γ), B.1.1 (Dependency Graph & Proofs), A.12 (Transformer), A.14 (Mereology Extension), A.15 (Strict Distinction).
* **Specialises into:** **B.1.5 Γ\_method** (adds duration, capability typing, join soundness rules).
* **Works alongside:** **B.1.6 Γ\_work** (resource accounting per step/phase).
* **Triggers:** **B.2 Meta‑Holon Transition (MHT): Recognizing Emergence and Re‑identifying Wholes** when re‑ordering or re‑phasing produces genuinely new properties.
* **Feeds:** **B.4 Canonical Evolution Loop** (time‑aware cycles that carry explicit costs and order).

> **One‑page takeaway.**
> If **order changes meaning**, use **Γ\_ctx** with an explicit **OrderSpec** and independence/joins.
> If you are **composing the same carrier across time**, use **Γ\_time** with a **TimeWindow**, coverage, and identity.
> Keep structure, mapping, and cost in their places, and the invariants will do the rest.

## **B.1.5 Γ\_method — Order‑Sensitive Method Composition & Instantiation** \[D]
+> **► decided‑by: A.14 Advanced Mereology**
+**A.14 compliance —** Methods compose over **SerialStepOf/ParallelFactorOf** on **MethodDescription/Method** graphs (order, not parthood); stuff‑like inputs are modelled via **PortionOf** on resources and accounted in **Γ_work**; method/version history uses **PhaseOf**; mapping quality is handled via **CL** (B.3).
 
> **Plain‑English headline.**
> **Γ\_method** turns **ordered step‑methods** into a **single composite Method** (run‑time) and, dually, turns **ordered step specifications** into a **single MethodDescription** (design‑time). It reuses **Γ\_ctx** for order, keeps **work/cost in Γ\_work**, and makes **pre/post‑conditions and capability typing** explicit so models stay physically and logically sound.

### 1) Context

* **Strict Distinction (A.15)** separates **what a holon is** (structure), **how steps are ordered** (order), **how it unfolds** (time), **what it spends** (work/resources), and **what it values** (objectives).
* **Method vs MethodDescription.**

  * **Method** is the **run‑time enactment** (a holon‑in‑role executing a concrete sequence of transformations).
  * **MethodDescription** is the **design‑time description** of that sequence (steps, order, pre/post‑conditions, required capabilities).
    Calling the sequence a “process” is common in some domains, but in FPF we use **Method/MethodDescription** to avoid conflating behaviour with work.
* **A.15 (Role–Method–Work Alignment)** supplies the **typed ordered relations** we need: **SerialStepOf** (strict precedence) and **ParallelFactorOf** (order‑concurrent branches with a join).
* **B.1.4 (Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time)** already handles **non‑commutativity** (order matters) and **temporal slicing**; **B.1.6 (Γ\_work)** handles **resource spending** and **efficiency**.
  **Γ\_method** sits **between** them: it composes methods **by order and capability** and **delegates** resource accounting to **Γ\_work**.

### 2) Problem

Without a dedicated, order‑aware method operator:

1. **Design/run conflation.** Authors mix **MethodDescription** (blueprint) and **Method** (enactment), producing “methods” that have both planned and executed attributes.
2. **Order erasure.** Sequences with crucial **pre/post‑conditions** get collapsed into sets; reordering breaks correctness while still “passing” naive aggregation.
3. **Capability mismatches.** Step outputs do not match the next step’s required inputs, but this is hidden in untyped edges; composite methods become non‑executable.
4. **Work leakage.** Costs and resource flows are **inlined** into method definitions; later models double‑count or violate conservation (Γ\_work was created to prevent this).
5. **Synergy by arithmetic.** Throughput or quality jumps caused by **proper joins** or **coordination** are misreported as simple sums or averages—violating WLNK and obscuring when a **Meta‑Holon Transition (B.2)** should be declared.

### 3) Forces

| Force                                    | Tension                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Order fidelity vs. simplicity**        | Keep the **true sequence** (non‑commutative) ↔ Provide a **small** operator set.                        |
| **Type safety vs. flexibility**          | Enforce **capability typing** and **pre/post** checks ↔ Allow modular reuse of steps across contexts.   |
| **Design vs. run**                       | Compose **MethodDescription** for planning ↔ Instantiate **Method** for execution without mixing them.         |
| **Parallelism vs. correctness**          | Maximise concurrency on **independent branches** ↔ Guarantee **sound joins** and reproducible outcomes. |
| **Parsimony vs. separation of concerns** | Keep Γ small ↔ Keep **work** and **assurance** in their own lanes (Γ\_work, B.3).                       |

### 4) Solution

#### 4.1 Terms (didactic recap)

* **U.MethodDescription** — a design‑time description: ordered steps, **SerialStepOf/ParallelFactorOf**, step **capability types**, **pre/post‑conditions**, and required **external interactions**.
* **U.Method** — a run‑time enactment by a **U.TransformerRole** (A.12): the same ordered pattern realised on concrete carriers, satisfying step pre‑conditions and producing post‑conditions.
* **U.StepSpec / U.StepMethod** — step‑level counterparts of the above.
* **Capability type** — the **state/action signature** a step requires and produces (not to be confused with resources; those belong to Γ\_work).
* **Method Interface Contract (MIC)** — the **order‑aware** analogue of BIC: a short, declarative statement of what **external interactions** of the steps are **Promoted / Forwarded / Encapsulated** at the composite method boundary.

> **Separation reminder.**
> Method composition ≠ resource spending. Keep **resource budgets, yields, dissipation** in **Γ\_work**; **Γ\_method** only checks and composes **order and capability**.

---

#### 4.2 The operator family (two companion flavours)

To respect the design/run split, **Γ\_method** is presented as two companion operators sharing the same semantics but acting at different scopes.

1. **Planning (design‑time) — compose specifications**

   ```
   Γ_method^plan : ( D_spec : OrderedDependencyGraph< U.StepSpec >,
                     σ       : OrderSpec,
                     MIC_in  : optional boundary hints )
                   → U.MethodDescription
   ```

   * **Domain.** `D_spec` contains step specifications linked by **SerialStepOf** / **ParallelFactorOf** (**A.15**).
   * **Result.** A single **U.MethodDescription** whose **MIC** is computed from step interfaces using the **Promote / Forward / Encapsulate** quartet (cf. BIC in B.1.2).

2. **Enactment (run‑time) — instantiate methods**

   ```
   Γ_method^run  : ( M_spec : U.MethodDescription,
                     T      : U.TransformerRole,
                     Bind   : carrier & parameter bindings )
                   → U.Method
   ```

   * **Domain.** A previously composed **MethodDescription**, a **Transformer** that plays the method, and concrete **bindings** (carriers, parameters).
   * **Result.** A **U.Method** (the real execution) provided that **capability checks** and **pre/post‑conditions** hold.

**Relationship to Γ\_ctx.**
Both flavours **reuse Γ\_ctx** invariants for order (non‑commutative composition with **NC‑1..3** reproducibility). **Γ\_method** specialises the **typing and boundary rules** for methods and introduces **MIC**.

---

#### 4.3 Core aggregation rules (design‑time composition)

When computing **Γ\_method^plan(D\_spec, σ)**:

1. **Order preservation.**
   Respect the **OrderSpec σ**; independent branches may be folded in any **topological sort** (Γ\_ctx NC‑3). **SerialStepOf** enforces strict precedence; **ParallelFactorOf** allows concurrency with a **join**.

2. **Capability continuity (typed joins).**
   Every join must be **type‑sound**: the **post‑condition / output signature** of each incoming branch must **meet** the next step’s **pre‑conditions** (logical entailment or declared **adapter** steps). Missing adapters are **defects**, not assumptions.

3. **MIC synthesis (boundary behaviour).**
   For each external interaction of a step, decide **Promote / Forward / Encapsulate** into the composite **MIC**. This inherits the clarity of BIC (B.1.2) for methods.

   * *Promote*: becomes a direct composite interaction (e.g., top‑level “start/stop”).
   * *Forward*: remains step‑local but exposed under the composite boundary (namespaced).
   * *Encapsulate*: becomes internal; callers cannot rely on it.

4. **Assurance hooks (without computing assurance).**
   Record where **B.3 assurance** will later hang: (i) the **cutset** steps that bound reliability/quality, (ii) the **integration edges** whose **CL** will penalise poor fit (mappings, fragile joins), and (iii) the **envelope** (G) intended for the method’s validity.

5. **No costs here.**
   If a step lists resources/yields, **do not** aggregate them here. Instead, add a pointer to the corresponding **Γ\_work** composition to be executed with the same order/joins at run‑time.

---

#### 4.4 Core aggregation rules (run‑time instantiation)

When executing **Γ\_method^run(M\_spec, T, Bind)**:

1. **Pre/post enforcement.**
   Before each step, verify **pre‑conditions** against **Bind** and the evolving carrier state; after, check **post‑conditions** hold. Failing these means the **Method** cannot be enacted as specified.

2. **Typed state flow.**
   The **state/action types** produced by a step must make the next step **well‑typed**; if not, an **adapter method** (itself with a MethodDescription) must be present in the graph.

3. **Order determinism (Γ\_ctx).**
   Respect `σ`. Parallel branches may execute independently **only if** they share no state that would break **NC‑1..3**; otherwise they must synchronise at the declared join.

4. **MIC honouring.**
   Interactions exposed by **MIC** are the **only** external commitments the composite method makes. Any additional ad‑hoc external interaction is a **model violation** (or requires updating the MIC and re‑planning).

5. **Γ\_work hand‑off.**
   Invoke **Γ\_work** to compute **spent resources, yields, dissipation** along the same order/join structure. The resulting work products **annotate** the Method but are **not** part of Γ\_method’s aggregation.

> **Invariant intuition.**
>
> * **IDEM:** a single step‑method composed alone yields the same method.
> * **COMM/LOC:** replaced by Γ\_ctx **NC‑1..3** (determinism given `σ`, context hash of `σ`, and partial‑order soundness).
> * **WLNK:** quality/throughput of the composite is bounded by the **critical path** steps (identified for later B.3 assurance).
> * **MONO:** strengthening a step (better pre/post, stronger type, improved adapter) **cannot** make the composite worse.

---

#### 4.5 Didactic contrasts (to prevent common confusions)

* **Method vs Work.**
  Method = **what** ordered transformations are enacted; **Work** = **resources spent / yields / dissipation** when enacting them (Γ\_work). Keep them distinct.

* **Method vs Structure.**
  Method composes **ordered steps**; structure composes **parts** (Γ\_sys). Do not use **ComponentOf** where **SerialStepOf/ParallelFactorOf** are intended.

* **Method vs Phase.**
  Method composition is **order**; **PhaseOf** (Γ\_time) is **temporal progression** of the **same carrier**. If a phase boundary also introduces **closure/supervision/context rebase**, that is **MHT** (B.2), not mere phasing.

* **MethodDescription vs Method.**
  Keep **planning** artefacts (MethodDescription) separate from **enactment** (Method). Γ\_method provides operators for both but never fuses them.

### 5) Archetypal grounding (worked, didactic)

#### 5.1 System archetype — **Assemble‑Paint‑Test** as one Method

* **Design‑time (Γ\_method^plan).**
  `D_spec` contains `StepSpec`s: `AssembleChassis`, `InstallPowertrain`, `PaintBody`, `RunFunctionalTest`.
  Relations: `AssembleChassis → InstallPowertrain` (**SerialStepOf**), `PaintBody ∥ RunFunctionalTest` after a structural seal (**ParallelFactorOf**).
  Capability typing:

  * Output of `InstallPowertrain` **meets** input of `RunFunctionalTest` (functional harness attached).
  * `PaintBody` requires sealed surfaces from `InstallPowertrain` (pre‑condition).
    MIC outcome:
  * **Promote:** `Start()`, `Abort()`, `CertificationReport`.
  * **Forward:** `RunFunctionalTest.Diagnostics` (namespaced).
  * **Encapsulate:** `PrimerMixingPort`, internal seal checks.

* **Run‑time (Γ\_method^run).**
  `T` enacts the `MethodDescription` on concrete carriers. Pre/post checks gate each step; parallel branches run after pre‑conditions met; a join waits for both to finish.

* **Assurance hooks (B.3).**
  Cutset steps for WLNK: `InstallPowertrain` (torque tolerances) and `RunFunctionalTest` pass/fail; integration edges carry **CL** for harness mapping and paint/seal specification.
  **Γ\_work** is invoked to compute energy/material spend and dissipation; Γ\_method does not tally costs itself.

#### 5.2 Episteme archetype — **Evidence‑Synthesis‑Publish** as one Method

* **Design‑time (Γ\_method^plan).**
  Steps: `CollectDatasets`, `NormalizeSchemas`, `EstimateModel`, `CrossValidate`, `DraftManuscript`.
  Ordering: `CollectDatasets → NormalizeSchemas → EstimateModel → CrossValidate → DraftManuscript`.
  Capability typing: `NormalizeSchemas` outputs a typed feature space that **entails** `EstimateModel`’s input; adapters specified for legacy datasets.
  MIC outcome:

  * **Promote:** `Submit()`, `ReleaseArtifacts()`.
  * **Forward:** `CrossValidate.Folds(k)`.
  * **Encapsulate:** ad‑hoc scrubbing utilities.

* **Run‑time (Γ\_method^run).**
  The same order executes; **Γ\_work** accounts for compute/storage spend.
  Assurance hooks: cutset at `CrossValidate`; integration **CL** for schema mappings; post‑condition for `DraftManuscript` includes provenance SCR.

### 7) Proof obligations (normative)

**At planning time (Γ\_method^plan):**

1. **PO‑PLAN‑ORDER.** Provide `OrderSpec σ`; produce `orderSpecHash`.
2. **PO‑PLAN‑TYPE.** For every edge, show **capability continuity**: `OutType(step_i) ⊢ InType(step_j)` or provide a typed **adapter StepSpec**.
3. **PO‑PLAN‑MIC.** For each step interaction, decide **Promote/Forward/Encapsulate** and justify in MIC.
4. **PO‑PLAN‑CL‑POINTS.** Identify integration edges whose **CL** will matter for B.3; record intended sources of mapping evidence.
5. **PO‑PLAN‑NO‑WORK.** Confirm that costs/resources are **not** aggregated here; point to the planned **Γ\_work** composition (by reference).

**At run time (Γ\_method^run):**

1. **PO‑RUN‑PRE/POST.** Demonstrate that pre‑conditions hold before each step; check post‑conditions after.
2. **PO‑RUN‑NC.** Show compliance with Γ\_ctx **NC‑1..3** (determinism with σ, context hash, partial‑order soundness).
3. **PO‑RUN‑MIC‑HONOUR.** Record that only MIC‑declared external interactions occurred.
4. **PO‑RUN‑WORK.** Attach the **Γ\_work** result (spent resources, yields, dissipation) aligned with the same order/join structure.
5. **PO‑RUN‑ASSURANCE.** Provide the observed values for the cutset steps and the actual **CL** of integration mappings to feed B.3 assurance.

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Design/Run Chimera** | Spec contains runtime measures; enactment adds planning edges | Split into `MethodDescription` vs `Method`; rerun Γ\_method per flavour.                  |
| **Orderless Set**      | Steps modelled as unordered; reordering breaks correctness    | Provide `OrderSpec σ` and recompose with Γ\_method/Γ\_ctx.                         |

---

### 10) Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Didactic clarity.** Readers see **what** is being composed (order & capability) vs **what** is spent (Γ\_work) vs **what** is assured (B.3).
* **Deterministic execution semantics.** Γ\_ctx‑backed order with explicit joins yields reproducible composites.
* **Robust interfaces.** MIC prevents accidental external dependencies and preserves modularity.
* **Cross‑scale fit.** Same pattern works for physical, organizational, and epistemic methods.

**Trade‑offs**

* **More explicitness up‑front.** Capability typing and MIC authorship require care; in return, later integration is safer.
* **Adapter discipline.** Modellers must create adapters rather than assuming conversions—this avoids hidden brittleness.

---

### 11) Rationale (informative)

* **Order is semantic.** Many failures stem from pretending that order does not matter; Γ\_method makes **non‑commutativity** explicit (via Γ\_ctx) while keeping the operator set small.
* **Strict Distinction.** The split between **Method/MethodDescription**, **Γ\_method/Γ\_work**, and **assurance** implements A.15, preventing category errors (behaviour vs spending vs claims).
* **Mereology alignment.** Using **SerialStepOf / ParallelFactorOf** (A.14) keeps method composition orthogonal to structural composition (**ComponentOf**) and temporal phasing (**PhaseOf**).
* **Assurance readiness.** Identifying cutsets and mapping CL points during planning makes B.3 application straightforward and auditable.

---

### 12) Relations

* **Builds on:** A.12 (Transformer Role), A.14 (Mereology Extension), A.15 (Strict Distinction); B.1.1 (Proof Kit), B.1.4 (Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time).
* **Coordinates with:** B.1.6 (Γ\_work) for resource accounting; B.3 (Assurance) for WLNK cutsets and CL penalties.
* **Triggers/Complements:** B.2 (MHT) when new closure/supervision or context re‑base appears at method level.
* **Used by:** Later domain architheories that define canonical methods in specific disciplines (without altering Γ\_method).

> **One‑sentence takeaway.**
> **Γ\_method** composes **ordered, typed steps** into a reliable method, keeps **interfaces explicit** (MIC), leaves **costs to Γ\_work**, and provides clean hooks for **assurance** and **emergence**.



## **B.1.6 Γ\_work — Work as Spent Resource** \[D]

+> **► decided‑by: A.14 Advanced Mereology**
+**A.14 compliance —** Only **Work** carries resource deltas; quantitative splits/consumption use **PortionOf** against pre‑consumption stocks; run histories use **PhaseOf** on Work; `MemberOf` MUST NOT be used for resource mereology; SCR/RSCR stay outside (use EPV‑DAG anchors).
 
### Context

FPF distinguishes **what is done** from **what it costs** to do it.

* **Method / Process (design‑time vs run‑time):**
  A **MethodDescription** is a design‑time description of how a transformation is to be performed. At run‑time, a **Method** is the execution of that MethodDescription by a **Transformer** (A.12, A.15).
  In Cluster B, sequencing and coordination of methods are handled by **Γ\_method** (B.1.5).

* **Work (this pattern):**
  **Work** is the **spent resource** caused by executing a Method. It is not “a process.” It is the **resource delta** we can account for across a holon boundary while a Method runs. Γ\_work defines how such deltas compose.

This separation makes models auditable and prevents category errors: **Γ\_method** composes *actions*; **Γ\_work** composes the *resource expenditure* of those actions.

---

### Problem

Without a dedicated algebra for spent resources, models drift into four errors:

1. **Process–Work conflation:** Time‑ordered steps and resource spending are mixed, producing ambiguous or double‑counted totals.
2. **Conservation violations:** Totals appear that exceed inputs or create “free” resource, contradicting physical and informational conservation.
3. **Boundary blindness:** Spending is reported without specifying the boundary across which it is measured, making numbers non‑comparable.
4. **Category errors in mereology:** Collection membership (MemberOf) is misused as if it were parthood for resource stocks, polluting Γ proofs (B.1).

---

### Forces

| Force                                               | Tension                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Conservation vs. Abstraction**                    | Totals must obey material/energy/information conservation ↔ models must stay simple and readable.                              |
| **Run‑time measurability vs. Design‑time planning** | We need measurable deltas at run‑time ↔ we also need ex‑ante yields from MethodDescription to plan.                                   |
| **Heterogeneous units vs. Unified sums**            | Resources come in different units (joules, kg, bits) ↔ we still need composite statements (vectors, typed sums).               |
| **Safety vs. Synergy**                              | Weakest‑link bounds must cap availability ↔ redundancy or substitution can improve feasibility but belongs to emergence (B.2). |

---

### Terminology guard‑rails (A.15 — Strict Distinction)

> These rules are normative in this pattern; they exist to prevent the recurring confusion noted in prior drafts.

* **MethodDescription** — design‑time description of a transformation (parameters, intended yield η).
* **Method** — the run‑time execution of that MethodDescription by a **Transformer**; it exists only while it runs.
* **Process** — a method seen as an ordered structure of steps; composed by **Γ\_method**.
* **Work** — **spent resource** (a measurable delta across a declared boundary) caused by executing a Method; composed by **Γ\_work**.
* **Transformer (T)** — a **U.System** playing a role that executes a Method (A.12).
* **Mereology for resources (A.14):** use `PortionOf` for **quantitative splits** and `PhaseOf` for **time‑slices**; **do not** use `MemberOf` for resource stocks.

---

### Solution — The Γ\_work Operator 
#### Part 1 — Operator & Basic Definitions

**Intent.** Provide a universal, conservative way to compose resource spending across parts and steps, without talking about control‑flow (that is Γ\_method’s job).

##### 1) Operator signature

```
Γ_work : (R : ResourceGraph, M_spec : U.MethodDescription?, T : U.TransformerRole) → W_tot : U.Work
```

* **R — ResourceGraph.** An acyclic graph whose nodes are **U.Resource** holons with typed, extensive quantities (e.g., energy, mass, information). Edges are **`consumes`**, **`produces`**, **`transfers`** and are tied to explicit **U.Boundary** declarations (A.14). Where a stock is subdivided, the split uses `PortionOf`; where a run is time‑sliced, the slices use `PhaseOf`.

* **M\_spec — optional.** If present, it provides *ex‑ante* yield/efficiency (η) for planning; if absent, Γ\_work composes purely from measured deltas.

* **T — TransformerRole.** The external system that executes or validates the resource accounting for the run; T is not a node of R (A.12).

* **Result W\_tot — U.Work.** A typed **Work vector** (possibly sparse) with the same basis as the resources in R. It is accompanied by a **Boundary Ledger** (see §3).

> **Do not confuse:** Γ\_work neither schedules nor orders steps; it composes **deltas**. If you need order, use Γ\_method and then apply Γ\_work per step and fold the resulting Work vectors (see Relations in Part 2).

##### 2) What counts as “Work”

Work is defined **with respect to a declared boundary** of the holon being transformed or assembled:

* **Boundary‑relative delta (conservative form):**
  For any resource type *q* measured on boundary *B* during a run,

  ```
  Work_B(q) = Inflow_B(q) − Outflow_B(q) − ΔStock_inside(q)
  ```

  where **ΔStock\_inside(q)** is the change of internal stock over the run (positive when the stock grows).

* **Embodiment split:**
  Work can be split into **Dissipation** (lost to environment) and **Embodied** (retained in produced holons as state). Both are part of the same Work vector; the split is a reporting choice, not a second algebra.

* **Heterogeneous vectors:**
  Γ\_work treats different resource types as a **typed vector space** (no implicit conversion). Equivalences (e.g., joules↔bits via a declared model) are allowed only if **declared in M\_spec** or in a domain CAL; otherwise vectors remain multi‑dimensional.

##### 3) Boundary Ledger (normative output metadata)

Every Γ\_work result **MUST** include a **Boundary Ledger**:

* **(i) Boundary scope:** which `U.Boundary` was used (source holon, ports).
* **(ii) Time window:** start/stop or `PhaseOf` slice identifiers.
* **(iii) Basis:** the ordered list of resource types and units.
* **(iv) Method context:** reference to `M_spec` (if any) and run identifier of the Method.
* **(v) Transformer:** identity of **T** (system playing the executing or auditing role).

This ledger is what makes cross‑model Work totals comparable and auditable (A.10).

##### 4) The invariant quintet instantiated (overview)

Γ\_work preserves B.1 invariants; the detailed proofs and corner cases are in Part 2.

* **IDEM (idempotence):** Work over a graph with a single resource node and no consumption edges is the zero vector.
* **COMM / LOC (local commutativity / locality):** For **independent** subgraphs, composed Work is additive and independent of local fold order.
* **WLNK (weakest‑link bound):** Effective Work is capped by the scarcest **critical** input on the boundary (no Work can exceed available supply).
* **MONO (monotonicity):** Increasing an available resource cannot decrease Work (for the same boundary and time window); decreasing dissipation or improving η cannot reduce feasibility.

##### 5) How Γ\_work relates to Methods (and to Γ\_method)

* **Design‑time:** `M_spec` may declare an intended yield **η** and admissible equivalences between resource types (e.g., heat→mechanical), but these are **assumptions** until a Method runs.
* **Run‑time:** A Method instance (executed by **T**) produces actual deltas. Γ\_work composes those deltas; it does not speculate.
* **Sequencing:** If multiple Methods are ordered, use **Γ\_method** to compose the order, then apply Γ\_work per step and sum the Work vectors (independent branches sum; synchronized branches take max on **time**, not on **Work**).

> **Didactic tip:** Think of **Γ\_method** as the **story of what happened**, and **Γ\_work** as the **receipt of what it cost**, both anchored to the same boundary and time window.

##### 6) Fold rules (how Γ\_work composes)

**6.1 Boundary partition (across parts of a whole)**
Let the system‑level boundary **B** be covered by a finite family of pairwise‑disjoint sub‑boundaries **{Bᵢ}** (ports, surfaces, interfaces) that together exhaust **B**. For any resource type *q* in the basis:

* **Partition additivity (normative):**

  ```
  Work_B(q) = Σ_i Work_Bi(q)
  ```

  Preconditions: (i) `Bi` are disjoint except for measure‑zero interfaces, (ii) meters are aligned (same units, same time window), (iii) internal stock changes ΔStock\_inside(q) are measured for the *same* closed region bounded by B.
  *Why it matters:* this is the cross‑scale rule that lets part‑level Work totals roll up to the whole without double counting.

**6.2 Time slicing (serial runs / phases)**
Let the run be split by a set of non‑overlapping intervals **{τⱼ}** that cover the window **τ** (use `PhaseOf` to tag the slices). Then:

```
Work_B(q, τ) = Σ_j Work_B(q, τ_j)
```

This is the **temporal additivity** of Work. It is the Γ\_work analogue of Γ\_time’s coverage rule: we never “smear” or reorder; we sum non‑overlapping slices.

**6.3 Concurrent branches (parallel activity)**
When two independent sub‑boundaries **B₁**, **B₂** are active over overlapping time, total Work still **adds**:

```
Work_B(q) = Work_B1(q) + Work_B2(q)
```

Independence here means: no shared port, no shared stock variable, no hidden transfer between B₁ and B₂ that bypasses the declared meters. If a shared internal stock exists, it must be accounted in ΔStock\_inside(q) for **B** to keep conservation exact.

> **Didactic contrast:** Γ\_method handles **duration** (Σ for serial, max for parallel). Γ\_work handles **resource** (Σ in both serial and parallel), because resource spending composes additively across disjoint boundary parts and disjoint time slices.

**6.4 Multi‑resource vectors and declared equivalences**
Γ\_work never implicitly converts units. If a planning model needs an exchange (e.g., heat→mechanical, memory→compute), it must be **declared** in `M_spec` (or a domain CAL) as an **equivalence map** `E` applied **before** folding, yielding a new typed basis **E(basis)**. Absent such declaration, vectors remain multi‑dimensional and are added component‑wise.

**6.5 Availability gates (weakest‑link discipline)**
Many runs require **critical** inputs (a subset **Q\*** of the basis) to be present at or above a threshold. Let `Avail_B(q*)` be the measurable availability for `q* ∈ Q*` on boundary B during τ. Then feasibility is constrained by:

```
Work_B(q*) ≤ Avail_B(q*),  for all q* ∈ Q*
```

If any inequality is violated, the fold **must fail** or the modeller must declare a **Meta‑Holon Transition (B.2)** that introduces redundancy/substitution as a new structural capability (changing Q\* or the equivalence map). This is WLNK in resource form.

##### 7) Embodiment and dissipation (reporting scheme)

Every Work vector **MAY** be split into two projections, both defined on the **same basis** and the **same boundary/time window**:

* **Embodied\_B(q)** — the part of Work retained **inside** B as *state change* of produced holons (e.g., latent heat stored, material incorporated, committed data).
* **Dissipated\_B(q)** — the part of Work irreversibly exported beyond B (e.g., heat loss, scrap, discarded packets).

By norm:

```
Work_B(q) = Embodied_B(q) + Dissipated_B(q)
```

This split is **informative**, not a second algebra: Γ\_work always folds the **total** Work; the split is attached in the **Boundary Ledger** for transparency.

---

##### 8) Invariants — edge cases and proof sketches

**8.1 IDEM (idempotence)**
If `R` has one resource node, no `consumes/produces/transfers` edges, and ΔStock\_inside(q)=0, then

```
Work_B(q) = 0  (the zero vector)
```

Trivial by definition: no measured delta across B implies zero Work.

**8.2 COMM/LOC (local commutativity / locality)**
Let `R` factor into independent subgraphs `{Rᵢ}` whose boundary partitions `{Bᵢ}` are disjoint and cover **B** (6.1). Since each `Work_Bi` is evaluated with its own meters and time slices (6.2), and vector addition is commutative/associative, any local fold order yields the same `Σ_i Work_Bi`. Hence Γ\_work inherits commutativity/locality **under independence**.
*Note:* If subgraphs share a stock variable, independence fails and the modeller must either (i) refactor boundaries to restore independence, or (ii) model the shared stock explicitly in ΔStock\_inside(q) for the **parent** B.

**8.3 WLNK (weakest‑link)**
Let **Q\*** be the critical input set with availability caps `Avail_B(q*)`. Since the delta definition measures **net** consumption across B (inflow–outflow–Δstock), and no external creation is allowed, each `Work_B(q*)` cannot exceed `Avail_B(q*)`. If the plan suggests more, you have either (a) a measurement error, (b) a missing equivalence declaration in `M_spec`, or (c) a true emergent synergy that must be modelled as **MHT** (new redundancy/substitution capability).

**8.4 MONO (monotonicity)**
Monotonicity is interpreted along three characteristics; in all cases “improvement” never makes the whole **worse** (i.e., never increases required Work nor decreases feasibility):

* **Availability monotonicity:** Increasing `Avail_B(q)` for any non‑critical q leaves `Work_B(q)` unchanged (availability is not auto‑consumed); increasing it for a critical q cannot increase `Work_B(q)` and weakly increases feasibility.
* **Yield monotonicity (η):** For a fixed output target, increasing declared or measured **η** weakly **decreases** the required `Work_B(q)` in the inputs, never increases it.
* **Loss monotonicity:** Decreasing dissipation (better insulation, better compression) weakly **decreases** `Dissipated_B(q)`; total Work cannot go up as a result.

**8.5 Compatibility with Γ\_method**
Let a process be composed by Γ\_method from steps `{S_k}`, each with its own boundary partition `{B_k}` and time slice `{τ_k}`. If independence holds between steps at the resource boundary level (no hidden cross‑leaks), the summed Work

```
Σ_k Work_Bk(q, τ_k)
```

is invariant to any topological sort consistent with Γ\_method’s order (Γ\_method may change *when* costs are incurred; Γ\_work adds *how much* is spent).

**Manager note.** When reviewing a plan, inspect **Γ\_method** (is the order/capability sound?). When reviewing results, inspect **Γ\_work** (do the boundary‑relative deltas and units make sense?). Use **PhaseOf** to align both views over time.

| **WLNK**                    | Gas supply cap limits feasible heat cycles (critical input); if redundancy is added (dual supply), model it as MHT. | Storage bandwidth caps data‑read; adding a cache hierarchy is MHT (new structural capability), not “free” efficiency.                |

#### 11) Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Audit‑ready costing:** A single definition of Work makes multi‑scale totals consistent and comparable.
* **Separation of concerns:** Control‑flow (Γ\_method) never contaminates cost accounting (Γ\_work).
* **Cross‑scale reliability:** Partition/time additivity gives predictable roll‑ups from parts and phases.
* **Safety by design:** WLNK gates reveal feasibility limits early; emergence is explicit via MHT.

**Trade‑offs / mitigations**

* **Boundary modelling effort:** Requires explicit ports and stock deltas. *Mitigation:* use A.14 templates for common boundary patterns.
* **Vector heterogeneity:** Mixed units can be hard to read. *Mitigation:* keep vectors typed; add equivalence maps only when justified in `M_spec`.
* **Independence discipline:** Shared stocks complicate additivity. *Mitigation:* elevate stock accounting to the parent boundary per CC‑B1.6.7.

---

#### 12) Rationale (informative)

Γ\_work is a conservative algebra of **spent resources**. It respects physical conservation (mass/energy), supports information‑centric resources without conflation, and keeps the **design‑time** (MethodDescription) separate from **run‑time** (Method) facts (A.15). Additivity over disjoint boundaries and non‑overlapping phases is the minimal set of rules that yields stable cross‑scale accounting while remaining faithful to the universal invariants of B.1. Emergent efficiency (redundancy, substitution) is not “free”: it is made structural via **Meta‑Holon Transition** (B.2), after which the same algebra applies at the new level.

#### 13) Relations

* **Builds on:** A.12 **Transformer Principle**; A.14 **Mereology Extension** (PortionOf, PhaseOf); A.15 **Strict Distinction** (MethodDescription / Method / Work).

## **B.2 Meta‑Holon Transition (MHT): Recognizing Emergence and Re‑identifying Wholes** \[A]

> **Plain‑English headline.**
> When composition yields a **new, coherent whole**—with its **own boundary**, **objective**, and **capabilities** that cannot be faithfully treated as “just parts folded together”—declare a **Meta‑Holon Transition**. Record the **event** that created the new holon and let the Γ‑invariants apply **anew** at the higher level.

### 1) Context

* **Universal composition (B.1)** provides Γ‑flavours for structure (**Γ\_sys**, **Γ\_epist**), order (**Γ\_ctx/Γ\_method**), and time (**Γ\_time**). These flavours preserve **WLNK** and **MONO** and—except for order/time cases—assume **local commutativity**.
* **Mereology (A.14)** distinguishes **ComponentOf / ConstituentOf** (structure), **SerialStepOf / ParallelFactorOf** (order), and **PhaseOf** (temporal parts of the **same** carrier).
* **Strict Distinction (A.15)** separates **structure**, **order**, **time**, **cost**, and **values**; we must not disguise emergence as arithmetic “optimism” or as a type error.
* In practice, some compositions produce **qualitatively new behaviour** (e.g., a closed feedback loop enabling regulation; an integrated argument that becomes explanatory rather than merely descriptive). FPF names this **Meta‑Holon Transition** (MHT) and treats it as a **first‑class modelling move**.

FPF’s stance on **identity across time** is **ecumenical**: both **4D extensional** and **3D+1 endurantist** readings are admissible **as long as** the modeller makes **identity and event boundaries explicit**:

* In **4D**, a holon is a world‑tube; **events** are boundaries between **temporal parts**; `PhaseOf` picks out segments; an MHT marks a **new tube** beginning (re‑identification).
* In **3D+1**, a holon endures; **events** are state transitions; `PhaseOf` are time‑indexed **states**; an MHT marks **creation** of a **new enduring entity** and its relations to predecessors.

FPF does **not** force a metaphysical choice; it requires **clear declarations** so Γ‑proofs and B.3‑assurance remain unambiguous.

---

### 2) Problem

Without an explicit MHT pattern, four pathologies recur:

1. **Invariant evasion:** When redundancy or coordination lifts performance above the **weakest‑link** bound, authors “massage” arithmetic instead of acknowledging **new structure/closure**.
2. **Identity drift:** A system changes boundary, objective, or supervisory structure, yet the model silently treats it as the “same holon,” corrupting histories (**Γ\_time**) and claims (**B.3**).
3. **Context leakage:** A composite crosses a **bounded context** (new vocabulary, units, policy), but the model keeps scoring in the old context, inflating **R\_eff** by ignoring **congruence penalties**.
4. **Order/time confusion:** Genuinely **order‑dependent synergies** (Γ\_ctx/Γ\_method) or **phase consolidations** (Γ\_time) are misrepresented as simple structural sums (Γ\_sys), losing causal and temporal meaning.

---

### 4) Solution — **Part 1: What an MHT is, when to declare it, and how it relates to Γ**

#### 4.1 Definition (normative)

A **Meta‑Holon Transition (MHT)** is a **declared event** in which a configuration of holons—previously related by Γ‑composition in some flavour—**is promoted** to a **new holon** `H⁺` with a **new or revised**:

* **Boundary** (external interface and enclosure, per A.14/B.1.2),
* **Objective / Evaluation basis** (what `H⁺` tries to maintain/achieve), and/or
* **Supervisory structure / Capability** (closed feedback, decision loop, policy enactment).

After MHT, the Γ‑invariants apply **afresh** to `H⁺` and its parts. Prior assurance (B.3) remains valid for **pre‑MHT** claims; **post‑MHT** claims are assessed for `H⁺` under its own boundary, objective, and context.

> **Didactic guard‑rail.**
> If a perceived “synergy” is fully explainable **within the current Γ‑flavour**—e.g., by raising congruence **CL**, improving parts (MONO), or fixing order (Γ\_ctx)—**do not** declare MHT. MHT is reserved for **new closure** or **new supervision** that changes what counts as “the whole”.

---

#### 4.2 Triggers for declaring MHT (BOSC‑A‑T‑X)

Declare MHT when one or more of the following **observable triggers** occur (measurements are recorded in the promotion record; see Part 2):

* **B — Boundary closure/opening.** A coherent external boundary emerges (e.g., internal interfaces encapsulated; single regulated port) or its **type** changes (open ↔ closed/permeable) such that the system’s external commitments are different.
* **O — Objective emergence/reframe.** A new objective is instituted (e.g., regulation target introduced) or a prior objective becomes subordinate to a supervisory objective.
* **S — Structural re‑organization for supervision.** New **coordination channels** or a feedback loop close a circuit that **did not exist** at the previous level, producing regulation or self‑maintenance.
* **C — Capability super‑additivity (beyond WLNK).** Measured capability (or assurance) exceeds the **weakest‑link** bound **without** being explainable by improved parts or higher **CL** under the current Γ semantics.
* **A — Agency threshold crossing (A.13).** The holon begins to **play AgentialRole** with an **agency grade** sufficient to maintain objectives autonomously; this lifts the system into a supervisory regime.
* **T — Temporal consolidation.** Across **Γ\_time** phases, properties consolidate into a qualitatively new regime (e.g., commissioning → operational service) that **re‑anchors identity** or boundary.
* **X — Context rebase (bounded context).** The holon’s operative **vocabulary/units/policy** shift to a **new bounded context** (in DDD sense), requiring a new **Assurance context** and CL baselines.

> **Rule of thumb.**
> BOSC touches **what the holon is**; A/T/X touch **how and where it lives** (agency, time, context). Any **two** of these together almost always warrant MHT.

---

#### 4.3 Identity stance: 4D vs. 3D+1 (FPF’s ecumenical contract)

FPF permits both readings **provided** you make **identity and event claims explicit**:

* **4D contract:**

  * Pre‑MHT configuration is a set of world‑tube segments linked by Γ.
  * The **MHT event** marks the start of a **new tube** `H⁺`; earlier segments remain as precursors.
  * `PhaseOf` refers to **temporal parts**; **events** are boundaries between parts (and between tubes at MHT).

* **3D+1 contract:**

  * Pre‑MHT configuration is an enduring holon with time‑indexed states.
  * The **MHT event** is a creation event for **a new enduring holon** `H⁺`; a mapping relates `H⁺` to predecessors.
  * `PhaseOf` refers to **states**; **events** are transitions; MHT is a re‑identification point.

**Normative bridge:** Regardless of stance, you **must** (i) state whether identity **continues** (PhaseOf) or a **new identity** is created, and (ii) record the **Transformer** that performs the MHT.

---

#### 4.4 Event taxonomy for MHT (small, reusable set)

To avoid ad‑hoc naming, choose one **event type** (or a pair) and fill its parameters:

1. **Fusion** — several holons become `H⁺` with a new boundary/objective/supervision.
2. **Fission** — one holon splits into several peers, each with a proper boundary/objective.
3. **Phase Promotion** — a **Γ\_time** phase boundary coincides with BOSC‑A‑T‑X conditions; identity is re‑anchored to `H⁺`.
4. **Role‑Lift** — the holon starts **playing AgentialRole** at or above a declared grade threshold (A.13), enabling supervision.
5. **Context Reframe** — the holon’s bounded context shifts (terminology/units/policy), establishing `H⁺` in the **new context**; mappings to the prior context are recorded.

These are **Transformer events** (A.12). They do **not** imply toolchains or storage; they are conceptual commitments with audit fields (recorded later in Part 2).

---

#### 4.5 How MHT relates to Γ‑flavours and bounded contexts

* **With Γ\_sys / Γ\_epist (structure):**

  * If measured capability or assurance exceeds **WLNK** under current semantics, and the excess **cannot** be explained by **part improvements** or **CL** increases, **do not bend arithmetic**—declare MHT.
  * After MHT, the new holon `H⁺` re‑establishes its own WLNK/CL baselines.

* **With Γ\_ctx / Γ\_method (order):**

  * If introducing order/joins **creates a closed supervisory loop** that maintains an objective (e.g., sense → decide → actuate), declare **Role‑Lift** or **Fusion** MHT.
  * If order simply fixes a previously mis‑modelled sequence, that is **not** MHT; it is a normal correction under Γ\_ctx.

* **With Γ\_time (phases):**

  * Use **PhaseOf** for normal state progressions where identity continues.
  * If a phase boundary coincides with BOSC‑A‑T‑X, **Phase Promotion** MHT creates `H⁺`; histories remain linked but assurances are **not silently merged**.

* **With bounded contexts (DDD intuition):**

  * A **bounded context** is a **modelling contract** (vocabulary/units/policy). Crossing it without re‑baselining **CL** causes **trust inflation**.
  * Use **Context Reframe** MHT to re‑anchor `H⁺` in the new context and declare the mappings; B.3’s congruence penalty `Φ(CL)` now refers to the **new** baseline.

---

#### 4.6 What MHT is *not* (didactic contrasts)

* **Not a shortcut around WLNK/Φ.** If synergy is explainable by raising `CL` or improving parts, stay within Γ and B.3.
* **Not every KPI jump.** If the jump is within the declared envelope and context, **no** MHT is needed.
* **Not a version bump.** Version changes (`PhaseOf`) with the **same identity** are **Γ\_time**, not MHT.
* **Not “agent = new type.”** Agency is **a role** (A.13); MHT only when role enactment **changes closure/supervision** at the system level.

### 5) Promotion Record & proof obligations (normative)

To declare an MHT you MUST create a **Promotion Record** that makes identity, boundary, objective, supervision, and context shifts explicit. This record extends the general proof kit in **B.1.1**.

#### 5.1 Promotion Record — minimal fields

```
MHT.PromotionRecord
  id:                unique identifier
  eventType:         one of {Fusion | Fission | PhasePromotion | Role‑Lift | ContextReframe}
  transformer:       U.TransformerRole (who/what enacted the transition)
  identityStance:    one of {4D | 3D+1}
  preConfig:
    nodes:           list of holons (ids, kinds) involved before MHT
    edges:           list of relations & their types (A.14), including CL on integration edges
    Γflavour:        active Γ-flavour(s) prior to MHT
    assurance:       Assurance tuples for relevant claims before MHT (B.3)
    boundedContext:  name or description (vocabulary/units/policy) before MHT
  triggers:
    BOSC:            {B? O? S? C?} with measurements/artefacts
    A?               Agency-CHR grade & context (A.13)
    T?               Γ\_time phase boundary details (coverage, carrier identity/continuation)
    X?               context mapping summary (old↔new)
  postHolon (H⁺):
    boundary:        explicit BIC or equivalent boundary statement (B.1.2)
    objective:       objective(s) and evaluation basis for H⁺
    supervision:     supervisory/feedback structure present in H⁺ (if any)
    Γflavour:        Γ-flavour(s) intended for H⁺
    assurance:       initial Assurance(H⁺, C | K, S) with F/G/R & CL baselines
    boundedContext:  new context; mapping to previous (with CL for mappings)
  identityMapping:
    4D:              continuity/cut specification (precursors→H⁺ tube start)
    3D+1:            predecessor(s) and creation event; any PhaseOf segments preserved
  notes:
    alternativesConsidered:   why not modelled as non‑MHT Γ improvement
    evidenceAnchors:          references to measurements, specs, interface contracts, tests
    orderTimeRefs:            OrderSpec/TimeWindow if Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time material
```

#### 5.2 Proof obligations specific to MHT

* **MHT‑BOSC‑EVD.** For each selected trigger (B/O/S/C/A/T/X), attach the artefacts that evidence it (e.g., boundary contract for **B**, policy/regulation objective text for **O**, controller‑plant diagram for **S**, capability measurement vs WLNK bound for **C**, Agency‑CHR record for **A**, phase coverage & carrier identity for **T**, context mapping & unit schemes for **X**).

* **MHT‑NO‑EVADE.** Show that the observed improvement cannot be explained by **within‑Γ** moves alone: improved parts (MONO), raised congruence CL, corrected order (Γ\_ctx), or richer phase coverage (Γ\_time). If any of those suffice, **MHT is not justified**.

* **MHT‑ASS‑REBAS.** Provide **before/after** assurance tuples (B.3) for the same typed claim(s) or justify claim changes; do not fuse design/run scopes.

* **MHT‑IDENT.** State identity stance (4D or 3D+1) and the identity mapping (continuation vs new identity). Mixing stances in the same record is forbidden.

* **MHT‑CTX‑MAP.** For **ContextReframe**, list the concept/unit/terminology mappings and their CL levels; record the **new CL baseline** for future aggregations.

---

### 6) Archetypal cases (worked, didactic)

#### 6.1 System — **Closed‑loop regulation emerges from components** (Fusion / Role‑Lift)

* **Pre‑config:** Plant, sensor, actuator exist; analyses show performance capped by **WLNK** path through the slowest actuator; interfaces calibrated at CL2. No supervisory closure.

* **Trigger:** **S** (supervisory structure closes a feedback loop) and **B** (boundary now exports a single regulated interface; internal ports encapsulated). Capability exceeds prior WLNK bound without any part upgrade.

* **MHT:** Declare **Fusion** (or **Role‑Lift** if the controller plays AgentialRole). Create `H⁺ = RegulatedSystem` with BIC exposing the regulated port and supervisory objective (“maintain y≈r”).

* **After:** Γ‑invariants re‑start for `H⁺`. **B.3** assurance uses a new cutset; congruence on controller–plant mapping is part of `CL_min`.

* **Why not within‑Γ?** The performance jump is not due to improved parts or raised CL on existing edges; it stems from **new closure**.

#### 6.2 Episteme — **From compendium to theory** (Fusion / ContextReframe)

* **Pre‑config:** Several high‑quality results integrated as a catalogue; mappings among constructs are at CL1 (loose analogies).

* **Trigger:** **O** (a unifying explanatory **objective**: predict & explain class Q), **C** (explanatory success beyond min of parts), **X** (terminology reframed around new primitives with verified mapping at CL2/CL3).

* **MHT:** **Fusion** + **ContextReframe** to `H⁺ = Theory_T` with an explanatory objective; mappings to the prior compendium are documented.

* **After:** Assurance for “explains Q within δ” starts at `H⁺` with its own `F_eff` (may rise if formalized), `G_eff` (supported domain), and `R_eff` penalized by the **new** mapping CL.

#### 6.3 Temporal — **Commissioning → Operations** (PhasePromotion)

* **Pre‑config:** `PhaseOf` slices (install, calibrate, trial). Identity of the same carrier is maintained.

* **Trigger:** **T** (phase boundary) plus **B** (boundary type changes: open commissioning ports are encapsulated) and **O** (objective shifts from “achieve acceptance tests” to “deliver service SLA”).

* **MHT:** **PhasePromotion** creates `H⁺ = System‑in‑Operation`. Past phases remain as documented temporal parts; design‑time assurance is not mixed with run‑time assurance.

#### 6.4 Context — **Prototype → Certified product** (ContextReframe)

* **Pre‑config:** Prototype in a lab context with ad‑hoc units and informal safety claims.

* **Trigger:** **X** (bounded context shifts to regulated environment), **F rises** (formal safety case), **CL** for unit/requirement mappings vetted.

* **MHT:** **ContextReframe** to `H⁺ = CertifiedProduct`; new **BIC** and regulatory vocabulary become the baseline; earlier lab claims are not silently “ported”.


### 6.5 · Certification Interface Example *(Informative)*

Conceptual signature (notation‑neutral):

```
certify(role, context, window, snapshot, options) → StateAssertion
```

**Sketch.** `snapshot` contains coordinates over the Role’s RCS (A.19). `options` may reference named normalizations/gauges/overlays used in evaluation. The resulting **StateAssertion** states the target state (by name), the checklist applied (by name), the verdict, the window, and (if used) the **declared** Bridge/Gauge employed for translation.  
**Intent.** This example aids implementers; **normative constraints** on comparability, gauges, and evidence live in **A.19** and **C.16**, not here.

### 7) Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑B2.1** | An MHT MUST have a **Promotion Record** with fields in §5.1 completed and **identityStance** chosen.                            | Avoid ambiguous identity shifts.                   |
| **CC‑B2.2** | MHT MAY be declared only when at least **one BOSC‑A‑T‑X** trigger is evidenced and **MHT‑NO‑EVADE** holds.                      | Prevent “emergence by arithmetic”.                 |
| **CC‑B2.3** | Post‑MHT holon `H⁺` MUST provide **BIC** (boundary), an **objective** statement, and (if present) a supervisory description.    | Re‑anchor what the whole **is**.                   |
| **CC‑B2.4** | Pre‑ and post‑assurance MUST be reported as **separate** tuples (B.3).                                                          | No design/run or context chimeras.                 |
| **CC‑B2.5** | **ContextReframe** MHT MUST include the mapping set and CL levels; **R\_eff** thereafter uses the **new CL baseline**.          | Make context explicit; reset penalties coherently. |
| **CC‑B2.6** | **PhasePromotion** MUST state whether identity continues (4D: new tube start; 3D+1: new enduring holon) and justify the choice. | Keep temporal semantics clear.                     |
| **CC‑B2.7** | **Role‑Lift** MUST reference Agency‑CHR but MUST NOT use agency to bypass WLNK or CL penalties.                                 | Preserve safety invariants.                        |

### 8) Anti‑patterns & repairs

| Anti‑pattern               | Symptom                                                 | Repair                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emergence by averaging** | Post‑composition KPI > WLNK, justified by means/weights | Declare MHT only if BOSC/S is met; otherwise raise CL or improve parts within Γ.    |
| **Invisible context hop**  | New units/terms silently adopted                        | Use **ContextReframe**; record mappings and CL; re‑baseline assurance.              |
| **Every phase = MHT**      | Each version treated as a new holon                     | Use **PhaseOf** for ordinary state progressions; reserve MHT for BOSC‑A‑T‑X.        |
| **Agency as type**         | Introduce `U.Agent` and claim new identity              | Keep agency as role (A.13); MHT only if supervision/closure changes the whole.      |
| **Boundary amnesia**       | Interfaces changed but not recorded                     | Update BIC; if external commitments change materially, declare MHT.                 |
| **Order magic**            | Reordering steps treated as emergence                   | If order fixes correctness (Γ\_ctx), no MHT; only closed loops/supervision qualify. |

---

### 9) Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Clarity & auditability.** Distinguishes **improvement within a level** from **creation of a new whole**.
* **Invariant integrity.** WLNK and CL penalties are preserved; when a new whole appears, invariants restart cleanly.
* **Method‑agnostic synergy.** Works with both **4D** and **3D+1** readings; dovetails with DDD’s **bounded contexts** and event‑centric modelling.
* **Easier assurance management.** Pre/post claims are comparable without being conflated; teams can plan targeted moves (raise CL, formalize, reframe context).

**Trade‑offs**

* **Extra documentation at the right time.** Declaring MHT is deliberate; it requires a Promotion Record and evidence.
* **Identity bookkeeping.** Teams must choose an identity stance and be consistent; this cost buys cross‑scale coherence.

---

### 10) Rationale (informative)

* **Systems & control:** Closing feedback creates **new closed‑loop properties** not attributable to parts alone; treating this as an MHT avoids “synergy by arithmetic” and aligns with classical supervisory control and contemporary active‑inference views (A.13).
* **Mereology & identity:** By remaining **ecumenical** (4D or 3D+1) but **contractual** about identity declarations, FPF stays compatible with traditions akin to **BORO** (4D‑leaning) and **CCO** (endurantist uses), while keeping proofs unambiguous.
* **DDD/Event‑centric modelling:** Popular practices (bounded contexts, event storming) pivot on **events** and **context boundaries**. MHT makes such events **first‑class** in FPF, turns context hops into explicit **ContextReframe** transitions, and ties them to assurance via **CL baselines**.
* **Assurance discipline:** Re‑baselining **F/G/R** and **CL** at MHT points prevents cross‑context overconfidence and enables principled improvement plans.

---

### 11) Relations

* **Builds on:** A.12 (Transformer), A.13 (AgentialRole & Agency‑CHR), A.14 (Mereology Extension), A.15 (Strict Distinction); B.1.x (Γ flavours), B.3 (Assurance).
* **Used by:** B.4 (Evolution Loops: MHT as macro‑steps on the loop), KD‑CAL action patterns (when re‑framing models/theories).
* **Complements:** B.1.4 (Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time) by distinguishing **order/phase** corrections from **emergence**; B.1.2/B.1.3 by restarting compositional invariants at the new level.

> **One‑sentence takeaway.**
> **Declare MHT** when closure, supervision, or context re‑base creates a **new whole**; document the event, reset invariants, and keep pre/post assurance cleanly separated.

### Pattern B.2.2 — MST (Sys) — Meta-System Transition \[A]

**Context**

The universal pattern for emergence, **Meta-Holon Transition (MHT, Pattern B.2)**, describes how a collection of holons can become a new, coherent whole. This sub-pattern, `MST (Sys)`, details the specific case where the constituent parts are **physical or cyber-physical systems (`U.System`)**. This is the classic scenario of emergence in engineering and nature: a collection of robots forming a swarm, a group of servers becoming a self-healing cloud platform, or a set of components assembling into a functioning engine.

While the general principles of MHT apply, `U.System`s have unique properties—such as physical boundaries, energy flows, and operational interfaces—that make their transitions distinct and require specific triggers and contracts.

**Problem**

When a collection of systems begins to coordinate, managers and engineers face a critical decision point. If they continue to treat the aggregate as just a "bag of parts," they fall victim to several pathologies:

1.  **Reductive Blindness:** They miss emergent, system-level hazards (like cascade failures or swarm oscillations) because their analysis remains focused on individual component reliability.
2.  **Accountability Vacuum:** There is no clear owner for the *collective's* behavior. When the swarm fails, who is responsible? The operator of drone A or drone B?
3.  **Invalid Assurance Transfer:** A safety case or performance guarantee that was valid for an individual system may be silently invalidated by its interactions within the collective, but this goes unnoticed.

| **Local Autonomy vs. Global Coherence** | How to allow individual systems to operate efficiently while ensuring their actions contribute to a stable and predictable collective goal. |
| **Bottom-up Emergence vs. Top-down Design**| Is the new meta-system an unplanned, emergent phenomenon to be managed, or a deliberately designed system-of-systems to be constructed? |
| **Performance vs. Predictability** | Tightly coupled coordination can unlock new capabilities, but it can also introduce complex, hard-to-predict failure modes. |

**Solution**

An MST (Sys) is a formal promotion of an aggregate of `U.System`s to a new, single `U.System` holon. This promotion is not a subjective decision; it is a **mandatory modeling step** triggered when the aggregate demonstrably satisfies the **B-O-S-C** criteria, adapted for systems.

**1. The B-O-S-C Triggers for Systems**

The four triggers from the parent MHT pattern are interpreted in the context of physical and cyber-physical systems:

| Trigger | System-Specific Interpretation | Manager's View: The "Go/No-Go" Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **B - Boundary Closure**| The aggregate now exposes a single, unified **operational interface** (e.g., a single API gateway, a master control port). Internal system-to-system interactions are encapsulated and hidden from the outside world. | "Can I now operate this entire collection through a single dashboard or contract, without having to talk to each individual part?" |
| **O - Objective Emergence**| The collective pursues a new, measurable **operational objective** that did not exist for any individual system (e.g., maintaining a formation, maximizing fleet-wide energy efficiency, minimizing global latency). | "Is this group now working towards a shared goal that is fundamentally different from what each member was doing alone?" |
| **S - Supervisor Emergence**| A new **control loop** appears. The collective state is measured, and this information is used to actively regulate the behavior of the individual systems to achieve the new objective. | "Is there a mechanism—whether a central brain or a distributed consensus—that is actively steering the parts to work together?" |
| **C - Complexity Threshold** | The number and intensity of interactions between systems cross a point where reasoning about them as a whole is simpler and more predictive than tracking every pairwise interaction. | "Have we reached the point where trying to manage every individual interaction is causing more problems than it solves?" |

When all four conditions are met, the collection **must be** re-identified as a new `U.System` via the `emergesAs` relation.

**Archetypal Grounding**

| Domain | Constituent `U.System`s | Emergent Meta-System (`U.System`) | Key Trigger Evidence (B-O-S-C) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cloud Computing** | A set of independent, containerized microservices. | An **autonomous cloud platform**. | **B:** A single API gateway and control plane now mediate all external traffic. **O:** A new system-wide SLO (Service Level Objective) for end-to-end latency is enforced. **S:** A Kubernetes-like orchestrator (the supervisor) actively schedules, scales, and heals the microservices based on global metrics. **C:** The number of services exceeds a threshold where manual pairwise management is no longer feasible. |
| **Robotics** | A group of individual, autonomous drones with local navigation rules. | A **search-and-rescue swarm**. | **B:** The swarm communicates with the operator via a single command channel. **O:** A new objective emerges: "collaboratively map and cover a designated area," which no single drone pursued. **S:** A distributed leader-election and formation-control algorithm acts as the supervisor. **C:** Swarm behavior becomes stable and predictable only above a certain number of drones (e.g., > 7). |
| **Socio-Technical** | A group of engineers from Development, QA, and Operations working in separate silos. | A cohesive **DevOps team**. | **B:** The team now presents a single interface to the business: a unified backlog and a single "definition of done." **O:** A new collective objective appears: "reduce the cycle time from idea to deployment to less than 24 hours." **S:** The daily stand-up and CI/CD pipeline act as a supervisory feedback loop, regulating the work of all members. **C:** The complexity of coordinating the three functions separately became a bottleneck. |

**Conformance Checklist**

*   **CC-B2.2.1 (Trigger Mandate):** An `emergesAs` relation for a set of `U.System`s **MUST** be justified by a **Promotion Record** (Pattern B.2) that provides evidence for all four B-O-S-C triggers.
*   **CC-B2.2.2 (System-Holon Mandate):** Both the constituent parts and the resulting meta-system **MUST** be modeled as `U.System` holons, not as abstract `U.Episteme`s or `U.Method`s.
*   **CC-B2.2.3 (Supervisor Mandate):** The emergent meta-system **MUST** contain an identifiable **supervisory component** or mechanism that implements the feedback loop. The architecture of this loop is further detailed in Pattern B.2.5.
*   **CC-B2.2.4 (Boundary Inheritance):** The boundary of the new meta-system **MUST** be formally derived from the boundaries of its constituent systems, following a declared **Boundary-Inheritance Contract** (Pattern B.2.3, forthcoming).

**Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them**

| Anti-Pattern | Manager's View: What It Looks Like | How FPF Prevents It (Conceptually) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The "Big Bag of Parts"** | A collection of systems is given a collective name (e.g., "The Platform"), but there is no unified interface, no shared objective, and no active coordination. | **CC-B2.2.1** requires evidence for all four B-O-S-C triggers. A simple collection without boundary closure or a supervisory loop does not qualify for MST. It remains an aggregate, not a meta-system. |
| **The "Emergence by Fiat"** | A manager declares that a new, synergistic capability has emerged, but there is no underlying mechanism to sustain it. The "improvement" is a temporary artifact of heroic effort, not a stable property of the system. | **CC-B2.2.3** mandates the existence of an identifiable supervisor. If there is no feedback loop to maintain the new behavior, no MST has occurred. |
| **The "Hidden God-Controller"** | A system appears to be a self-organizing swarm, but its behavior is actually dictated by a hidden, external, centralized controller that is not part of the model. | The FPF's **Transformer Principle (A.12)** and **Boundary rules (A.1)** require that all external influences are made explicit. The controller must either be modeled as part of the meta-system (and thus inside its new boundary) or as an external `Transformer`. |

**Consequences**

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Makes Emergence Manageable:** The pattern transforms emergence from a mysterious, unpredictable phenomenon into an explicit, auditable architectural event. This allows managers to assign ownership, budget, and assurance targets to the new meta-system. | **Modeling Overhead:** Formally documenting an MST and its new contracts requires deliberate modeling effort. *Mitigation:* This effort is an investment that pays off by preventing the much higher cost of managing the risks associated with un-recognized emergence. |
| **Enables Scalable Assurance:** By re-applying the FPF's assurance calculus at the new meta-level, the framework can provide meaningful safety and reliability guarantees for complex systems-of-systems. | - |
| **Provides a Language for Innovation:** The pattern gives architects and strategists a formal language for designing and reasoning about adaptive, self-organizing, and resilient systems. | - |

**Rationale**

This pattern provides the concrete instantiation of the universal MHT principle for the domain of systems. It is grounded in decades of research in cybernetics (Ashby's law of requisite variety), complexity science, and modern systems-of-systems engineering. By demanding evidence of **Boundary Closure**, a **Novel Objective**, and a **Supervisory Loop**, the pattern provides a robust, falsifiable filter that separates true emergence from mere aggregation.

It ensures that when we claim a system has "emergent properties," we are not making a vague, philosophical statement, but a precise, testable, architectural one. This rigor is essential for building trustworthy and manageable complex systems.

**Relations**

*   **Is a specialization of:** `B.2 Meta-Holon Transition (MHT)`.
*   **Is complemented by:** `B.2.3 MET (KD)` (for epistemic emergence).
*   **Provides the context for:** `B.2.5 Supervisor–Subsystem Feedback Loop`, which details the architecture of the supervisory mechanism.

**Context**

The universal pattern for emergence, **Meta-Holon Transition (MHT, Pattern B.2)**, applies not only to physical systems but also to bodies of knowledge. This sub-pattern, `MET (KD)`, details the specific case of a **Meta-Epistemic Transition**, where a collection of individual knowledge artifacts (`U.Episteme`s) is synthesized by a `Transformer` into a new, higher-level episteme that possesses novel explanatory or predictive power.

This is the formal FPF model for a scientific revolution, the creation of a unifying theory, or the synthesis of a comprehensive design philosophy. It is the moment when a collection of scattered facts, models, and hypotheses becomes more than just a library—it becomes a coherent worldview.

**Problem**

Without a formal concept of a Meta-Epistemic Transition, knowledge management efforts suffer from several pathologies:

1.  **The "List of Facts" Illusion:** A collection of well-validated but disconnected epistemes is mistaken for a comprehensive theory. The "whole" is assumed to be nothing more than the sum of its parts, and the potential for a deeper, unifying insight is missed.
2.  **Hidden Incoherence:** Contradictions or tensions between individual epistemes are ignored or averaged out. The resulting "synthesis" is a fragile composite, not a robust new theory.
3.  **Lack of Explanatory Power:** The collection of artifacts can describe phenomena but cannot explain them in a unified way. There is no overarching principle or "supervisory" concept that governs the individual pieces of knowledge.

**Forces**

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Synthesis vs. Aggregation** | How to distinguish a true intellectual synthesis that creates new meaning from a mere aggregation or "literature review" of existing facts. |
| **Purity vs. Integration** | How to maintain the integrity and reliability of individual, well-tested epistemes while integrating them into a new, broader, and initially more speculative framework. |
| **Creativity vs. Rigor** | The creation of a new theory is a creative act (abduction), but it must be grounded in a rigorous, auditable discipline that respects the underlying evidence. |

**Solution**

A MET is a formal promotion of an aggregate of `U.Episteme`s to a new, single `U.Episteme` holon. This promotion is a deliberate act performed by a `Transformer` (e.g., a research team, a standards body, an AI synthesis agent) when the aggregate satisfies the **B-O-S-C** criteria, adapted for knowledge.

**1. The B-O-S-C Triggers for Epistemes**

The four triggers from the parent MHT pattern are interpreted in the context of knowledge artifacts:

| Trigger | Epistemic-Specific Interpretation | Manager's View: The "Go/No-Go" Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **B - Boundary Closure**| The collection of epistemes is now presented under a **single conceptual boundary**—a new name, a unified set of definitions, and a shared symbolic representation. It is now treated as a single, citable entity. | "Can we now refer to this collection of ideas with a single name, like 'The Theory of Relativity' or 'The Agile Manifesto', and everyone knows what we mean?" |
| **O - Objective Emergence**| A new, **unifying explanatory or predictive objective** emerges that was not present in any of the individual epistemes. The new whole can now explain or predict phenomena that the parts could not. | "Does this new synthesis allow us to answer a bigger, more important question that none of the individual pieces of research could address on their own?" |
| **S - Supervisor Emergence**| A new set of **meta-principles, axioms, or core invariants** is introduced. These "supervisory" concepts govern and constrain all the lower-level epistemes within the new theory. | "Is there a new 'golden rule' or a core principle that now organizes all the other ideas and tells us how they fit together?" |
| **C - Complexity Threshold** | The number and complexity of the individual epistemes and their interrelations cross a point where a unifying theory becomes simpler and more powerful than managing the web of individual facts. | "Have we reached the point where we are drowning in details and need a simpler, more powerful abstraction to make sense of it all?" |

When a `Transformer` can provide evidence for all four triggers, it can formally declare a MET, creating a new `U.Episteme` via the `emergesAs` relation.

### B.2.3 — MET (KD) — Meta-Epistemic Transition \[A]

**Archetypal Grounding**

| Domain | Constituent `U.Episteme`s | Emergent Meta-Episteme (`U.Episteme`) | Key Trigger Evidence (B-O-S-C) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Physics** | A collection of disparate epistemes: Lorentz transformations, the principle of equivalence, observations of Mercury's perihelion, Maxwell's equations. | The **General Theory of Relativity**. | **B:** The theory is given a single name and a coherent mathematical formalism (tensor calculus). **O:** A new, unifying objective emerges: "to describe gravity as a manifestation of spacetime geometry." **S:** The Principle of Covariance and the Equivalence Principle act as "supervisory" axioms that govern all other equations in the theory. **C:** The complexity of patching classical physics became untenable. |
| **Software Development** | A collection of practices: iterative development, user stories, daily stand-ups, continuous integration, pair programming. | The **Agile Manifesto** and its associated body of knowledge. | **B:** The practices are collected under a single "Agile" banner with a shared vocabulary. **O:** A new objective appears: "to value individuals and interactions over processes and tools." **S:** A set of core values and principles (the Manifesto itself) acts as the supervisor, guiding the application of the individual practices. **C:** The waterfall model's inability to handle changing requirements reached a critical complexity point. |
| **Business Strategy**| Market analysis reports, competitor intelligence, internal capability assessments, technology trend forecasts. | A cohesive **Corporate Five-Year Strategy**. | **B:** The strategy is documented in a single, authoritative document. **O:** A new, overarching objective is defined, e.g., "to become the market leader in sustainable energy solutions." **S:** A set of strategic pillars (e.g., "Innovate in Battery Tech," "Expand into European Markets") acts as the supervisory framework for all operational plans. **C:** The complexity of disconnected departmental plans required a unifying vision. |

**Conformance Checklist**

*   **CC-B2.3.1 (Transformer Mandate):** A Meta-Epistemic Transition is an act of creation. The `emergesAs` relation **MUST** be attributed to an external `Transformer` (e.g., the authoring research team, a synthesis AI). Epistemes do not self-organize.
*   **CC-B2.3.2 (Trigger Mandate):** The `Transformer` **MUST** provide a **Promotion Record** (Pattern B.2) that includes a rationale and evidence for all four B-O-S-C triggers.
*   **CC-B2.3.3 (Episteme-Holon Mandate):** Both the constituent artifacts and the resulting meta-episteme **MUST** be modeled as `U.Episteme` holons.
*   **CC-B2.3.4 (Supervisory Principle Mandate):** The emergent meta-episteme **MUST** contain one or more identifiable "supervisory" principles or axioms that govern the interpretation and composition of its constituent parts.

**Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them**

| Anti-Pattern | Manager's View: What It Looks Like | How FPF Prevents It (Conceptually) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The "Grand Unifying Narrative" Fallacy** | A team writes a high-level summary of existing research and calls it a "new theory," but it offers no new explanatory principles or predictive power. | **CC-B2.3.2** and **CC-B2.3.4** require evidence of a *novel objective* and an *emergent supervisor*. A simple summary is just an aggregation (`Γ_epist`), not a MET. It lacks the creative leap that defines a true synthesis. |
| **The "Forced Marriage" of Ideas** | Two conflicting theories are mashed together into an incoherent "unified model" that is logically inconsistent and makes no sense. | The MET process is driven by a `Transformer`'s abductive insight. A MET is not a mechanical merge; it's the creation of a *new, higher-level conceptual framework* (the supervisor) that can successfully reconcile or contextualize the constituent parts. |
| **The "Ivory Tower Theory"** | A beautiful, unifying theory is created, but it is disconnected from the underlying evidence and makes no new, testable predictions. | FPF's **Trust & Assurance Calculus (B.3)** applies to the new meta-episteme. Its `Reliability (R)` score will be conservatively bounded by the `R` of its constituent parts and penalized by the `Congruence (CL)` of their integration. A purely speculative synthesis will have a low `R` score. |

**Consequences**

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Makes Intellectual Breakthroughs Formal:** The MET provides a formal, auditable way to represent moments of profound scientific or strategic synthesis. | **Requires High Cognitive Effort:** A MET is not a routine operation. It represents a significant intellectual achievement. *Mitigation:* This is by design. The high bar for declaring a MET ensures that it is reserved for genuinely transformative events. |
| **Creates Stable Foundations:** A well-formed meta-episteme (like a foundational scientific theory) provides a stable, high-`R` platform upon which "normal science" or incremental engineering can proceed. | - |
| **Guides Innovation:** The B-O-S-C triggers provide a clear checklist for R&D teams. They can actively work towards creating the conditions for a MET, rather than waiting for inspiration to strike. | - |

**Rationale**

This pattern provides the formal mechanism for modeling the most important events in the history of thought: the creation of new paradigms. It is the epistemic counterpart to the emergence of new levels of organization in physical systems. By defining a MET in terms of the B-O-S-C triggers and the creative act of an external `Transformer`, FPF provides a rigorous, non-mystical account of intellectual breakthroughs.

It ensures that when a claim of "synthesis" or "unification" is made, it is not just a rhetorical flourish but a precise, architectural event with clear pre-conditions and auditable consequences. This aligns with the FPF's core mission to make the process of thinking itself a subject of rigorous, first-principles engineering.

**Relations**

*   **Is a specialization of:** `B.2 Meta-Holon Transition (MHT)`.
*   **Is complemented by:** `B.2.2 MST (Sys)` (for physical emergence).
*   **Is performed by:** An external `Transformer` (A.12) executing an abductive leap (B.5.2).
*   **Produces:** A new `U.Episteme` whose trust and reliability are then governed by `B.3 Trust & Assurance Calculus`.

### **Pattern B.2.4 — MFT (Meta-Functional Transition) [A]** 

**Context**

The FPF framework provides distinct patterns for the emergence of new systems (`MST` for `U.System`s) and the synthesis of new knowledge (`MET` for `U.Episteme`s). However, a third, equally critical form of emergence occurs in the operational domain: the evolution of **capability**. Holons, particularly `Transformer`s executing `AgentialRole`s, do not just exist or represent knowledge; they *act*. These actions are guided by `Method`s, which represent their capabilities.

Initially, an organization or an autonomous system might possess a portfolio of simple, disconnected methods—individual skills or atomic operational procedures. For example, a software team has separate methods for writing code, running tests, and deploying artifacts. A manufacturing system has distinct methods for milling, drilling, and painting. These are executed as discrete tasks, often with manual hand-offs and coordination.

However, through learning, automation, and process refinement, a collection of these simple functions can crystallize into a single, cohesive, and often adaptive composite `U.Method`. This emergent capability is more than just a sequence of the original steps; it possesses its own internal logic, objectives, and regulatory mechanisms. FPF formally calls this event a **Meta-Functional Transition (MFT)**. It is the birth of a new, integrated operational capability.

**Problem**

If we lack a formal concept to describe the emergence of integrated capabilities, our models of complex operations remain fundamentally incomplete. We can describe the parts and the raw materials, but not the "well-oiled machine" itself. This conceptual gap leads to several severe, practical problems:

1.  **Capability Blindness:** The model cannot distinguish between a "bucket of skills" and a true "integrated capability." A team that can perform tasks A, B, and C independently is modeled identically to a high-performance team that has mastered a new, synergistic workflow combining A, B, and C. The emergent value created by integration remains invisible and unmanageable.
2.  **Siloed Optimization and Global Sub-optimization:** Without a formal representation of the composite `U.Method`, improvement efforts inevitably focus on the individual steps. A team might spend weeks making `Method_A` 10% faster, while the real bottleneck lies in the manual, error-prone hand-off between `Method_A` and `Method_B`. The team is locally efficient but globally ineffective.
3.  **Implicit Coordination and "Tribal Knowledge":** The critical coordination logic that weaves simple methods into a complex, adaptive workflow remains unstated. It lives in the heads of a few key individuals or is buried in un-documented scripts. This "tribal knowledge" is impossible to audit, transfer to new team members, or reliably improve. When a key person leaves, the emergent capability dissolves.
4.  **Inability to Govern Complex Workflows:** Without a formal holon representing the entire workflow, it is impossible to assign a clear owner, define end-to-end performance objectives, or create an assurance case for the workflow's reliability as a whole.

**Forces**

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Component Skills vs. Integrated Capability** | How to represent the qualitative leap from a set of individual, executable functions to a single, coherent, and often adaptive composite `U.Method` that possesses properties not found in any of its parts. |
| **Prescription vs. Performance** | The `MethodDescription` (the "recipe") describes how a method *should* be performed, but the MFT is about the emergence of the *actual, reliable capability* to perform it at run-time, often in ways that are more adaptive than the static recipe. |
| **Decomposition vs. Synergy** | How to model a composite `U.Method` that is demonstrably more than the sum of its parts, possessing new regulatory and synergistic properties, without violating the conservative Weakest-Link principle where it still applies. |
| **Explicit Design vs. Emergent Order** | Is the new meta-method a result of a deliberate, top-down design effort, or did it emerge bottom-up from the interactions of agents adapting to their environment? The framework must be able to model both pathways. |

**Solution**

An MFT is a formal promotion of a set of `U.Method`s into a new, composite **`U.Method`**. This new `U.Method` is often referred to descriptively as a **"meta-method"** because of its supervisory role, but it remains a `U.Method` in type, preserving ontological parsimony. The transition is a change in the **operational reality** of a `Transformer` or a collective of `Transformers`. It is declared when the performance of the methods satisfies the B-O-S-C triggers, adapted for function and capability.

**1. The B-O-S-C Triggers for Methods/Functions**

The four triggers from the parent MHT pattern are interpreted in the operational context of methods and functions:

| Trigger | Functional Interpretation | Manager's View: The "Go/No-Go" Question for Declaring a New Capability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **B - Boundary Closure**| The set of methods now exposes a single, unified **functional interface**. An external agent can invoke the entire workflow via a single, well-defined call (e.g., "initiate deployment"), without needing to know about or coordinate the individual internal steps. | "Can I now ask the team to 'run the deployment process' as a single, black-box service, or do I still have to personally manage the hand-offs between coding, testing, and release?" |
| **O - Objective Emergence**| A new, **operational objective** for the entire workflow emerges, which is not merely the sum of the objectives of the individual steps. This is often a holistic, end-to-end performance goal (e.g., "achieve a 99.9% success rate for the entire process"). | "Is the team now optimizing for the success of the *entire workflow*, even if it means one individual step has to run 'sub-optimally' (e.g., slower) for the good of the whole?" |
| **S - Supervisor Emergence**| A new **coordination and control logic** (the "supervisor") appears. This mechanism orchestrates the execution of the individual methods based on the state of the overall workflow. This "meta"-property is modeled via `controls` or `supervises` relations. | "Is there a concrete mechanism—whether it's a CI/CD orchestrator, a formal team protocol, or a project manager's explicit control board—that is now actively managing the flow and making decisions between the steps?" |
| **C - Complexity Threshold** | The cognitive or coordination overhead of manually managing the individual methods becomes a significant bottleneck. The cost of *not* integrating outweighs the cost of creating and maintaining the new, integrated workflow. | "Have we reached the point where the time we spend in meetings coordinating the hand-offs is taking more time and energy than the actual work itself?" |

When a `Transformer`'s performance demonstrates sustained evidence for all four triggers, an MFT has occurred. The `Transformer` now possesses a new, emergent composite `U.Method`.

> **Didactic Note on "Meta-" vs. "Supra-":**
> We use the prefix "Meta-" descriptively (as in a "meta-method") to signify the emergence of a new **layer of control and reflection**. A `U.Method` resulting from an MFT is not just a larger method; it is a method that *manages and orchestrates* other methods. This supervisory property is modeled through relations, not by creating a new `U.MetaMethod` type. This preserves ontological parsimony (Pillar C-5) by recognizing that the position in a control hierarchy is a relational property, not a change in fundamental type.

>
> The **Meta-Functional Transition (MFT)** described in this pattern is about the emergence of a new, composite **`U.Method`**. It is a transition in the *capability to act*, not just in the documentation or in a single execution.

**Archetypal Grounding**

The emergence of a new, composite `U.Method` is a universal pattern of learning and organization. It can be observed in technical, biological, and social domains.

| Domain | Constituent `U.Method`s | Emergent Composite `U.Method` ("Meta-Method") | Key Trigger Evidence (B-O-S-C) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Software Engineering** | A set of discrete developer methods: `WriteCode`, `RunUnitTests`, `CommitToCG‑SpecS`, `ManualDeploy`. | An **automated Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Pipeline**. | **B:** A single interface ("trigger pipeline") now executes the entire sequence. **O:** A new objective emerges: "maintain the main branch in a perpetually deployable state." **S:** The CI/CD orchestrator (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) acts as the supervisor, automatically sequencing steps and handling failures. **C:** The overhead of manual coordination became a bottleneck to frequent releases. |
| **Cognitive Science (Learning)** | A novice driver's individual methods: `CheckMirrors`, `PressClutch`, `ChangeGear`, `Steer`. | The expert driver's fluid, integrated **`Method` of "Driving"**. | **B:** The actions become a single, seamless behavior. **O:** A new, holistic objective appears: "navigate traffic smoothly and safely," replacing the focus on individual mechanical steps. **S:** The driver's cerebellum and basal ganglia form a "supervisor," coordinating the motor actions subconsciously. **C:** Conscious management of each step is too slow for real-world traffic. |
| **Organizational Design**| Separate, siloed methods in a company: `MarketingCampaign`, `SalesPitch`, `CustomerOnboarding`. | An **Integrated "Go-to-Market" `Method`**. | **B:** A single cross-functional team now owns the entire customer journey from lead to active user. **O:** A new objective is set: "maximize customer lifetime value (LTV)." **S:** A shared set of KPIs and a weekly cross-functional sync meeting act as the supervisory loop. **C:** The "leaky bucket" problem, where customers were lost in the hand-offs between departments, became too costly. |

**Conformance Checklist**

*   **CC-B2.4.1 (MFT Declaration Mandate):** The emergence of a composite `U.Method` with supervisory properties **MUST** be declared as an MFT and justified with a **Promotion Record** (Pattern B.2) that provides evidence for the B-O-S-C triggers.
*   **CC-B2.4.2 (Method-Holon Mandate):** Both the constituent functions and the resulting composite function **MUST** be modeled as `U.Method`s, documented by `U.MethodDescription`s, and enacted as `U.Work`. They are not `U.System`s.
*   **CC-B2.4.3 (Supervisor Relation Mandate):** The "meta" nature of the emergent `U.Method` **MUST** be modeled through explicit relations, such as `controls` or `supervises`, linking the `Transformer` enacting the composite `Method` to the execution of the constituent `Method`s. A new `U.MetaMethod` type **SHALL NOT** be created.
*   **CC-B2.4.4 (Interface Contract):** The emergent `U.Method` **MUST** have a formally documented interface contract (`Method Interface Contract` or MIC, see Pattern B.1.5), which specifies how the external world interacts with it and how the internal methods are encapsulated.

| **The "Process on Paper" Fallacy** | A team creates a beautiful, complex workflow diagram (`MethodDescription`) but continues to operate in the old, siloed way. The new capability exists only in documentation. | An MFT is a transition in **operational reality** (`U.Method` enactment), not just in `design-time` artifacts (`MethodDescription`). **CC-B2.4.1** requires evidence for the B-O-S-C triggers, which are based on observed behavior, not just documented intent. |
| **The "Micromanaging Supervisor"** | A new "meta-process" is introduced, but it's just a manager manually coordinating the old, separate steps. There is no new, emergent logic or automation. | **CC-B2.4.3** requires the supervisory function to be modeled as an explicit mechanism with `controls` relations. If the "supervisor" is just a person doing the same old coordination, no new, persistent `U.Method` has emerged. |
| **The "Capability by Fiat"** | A leader declares that a new, integrated capability now exists, but the underlying methods, tools, and objectives of the team have not actually changed. The "synergy" is aspirational. | An MFT is an observable, bottom-up phenomenon. The B-O-S-C triggers provide a falsifiable checklist. If there is no new boundary, no new objective, and no new supervisory loop, no MFT has occurred, regardless of declarations. |

**Consequences**

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Makes Capability Tangible:** The MFT provides a formal way to represent and manage integrated capabilities as first-class holons (`U.Method`s), making them visible, auditable, and optimizable. | **Modeling Effort:** Identifying and documenting an MFT requires analytical effort. *Mitigation:* This effort is an investment in creating a more robust and scalable operational model, preventing the much higher long-term cost of managing "tribal knowledge." |
| **Enables True Process Improvement:** It shifts the focus of optimization from local, component-level efficiencies to the performance of the end-to-end value stream. | - |
| **Fosters Organizational Learning:** The pattern provides a language for describing how teams and systems learn to work together more effectively, transforming implicit learning into an explicit, reusable asset. | - |
| **Improves Assurance and Governance:** By formalizing the emergent "meta-method," it becomes possible to create an assurance case for the entire workflow and assign clear ownership and accountability for its performance. | - |

**Rationale**

This pattern extends the FPF's theory of emergence into the crucial domain of action and capability. It recognizes that the most significant leaps in performance often come not from improving individual components, but from inventing new and better ways to coordinate them. The MFT is FPF's formal name for this act of organizational or operational creativity.

By defining the transition in terms of the observable B-O-S-C triggers and tying it to the rigorous `Method`/`Work`/`MethodDescription` distinction from Pattern A.15, the MFT provides a bridge between the abstract principles of cybernetics and the concrete realities of managing a project, a team, or an autonomous system. It ensures that when we talk about a "new way of working," we are referring to a precise, verifiable, and architecturally significant event.

**Relations**

*   **Is a specialization of:** `B.2 Meta-Holon Transition (MHT)`.
*   **Is complemented by:** `B.2.2 MST (Sys)` and `B.2.3 MET (KD)`.

### B.2.5 — Supervisor–Subholon Feedback Loop \[A] 

**Context**

Many of the most successful and resilient holons, both natural and engineered—from scientific paradigms and bacterial cells to the internet and human sensorimotor control—share a common architectural motif: a **Layered Supervisory Architecture**. In this architecture, the complex task of managing the holon is decomposed into a stack of functional layers. Each layer operates at a different spatiotemporal scale and level of abstraction, communicating with its neighbors through well-defined interfaces.

The paper "Towards a Theory of Control Architecture" by Matni, Ames, and Doyle (2024) provides a rigorous foundation for understanding such architectures in the context of control systems. FPF generalizes these insights to all holon types. For example, a **`U.System`** like an aircraft might have a Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) architecture realized by distinct `Transformer`s. Similarly, a **`U.Episteme`** like a large scientific theory has layers: foundational axioms (which act as a "decision making" layer), core theorems (a "trajectory planning" layer), and specific applications or derived lemmas (a "feedback control" layer). This layered structure is a convergent solution to the fundamental problem of managing complexity.

**Problem**

While the concept of layered supervision is intuitive, its formal modeling is fraught with conceptual traps. Without a strict, principled distinction between different types of hierarchies, as mandated by **Strict Distinction (A.7)**, models become ambiguous. The primary challenge is to untangle three distinct hierarchies for any given holon:

1.  **The Structural Hierarchy (Levels):** The mereological (part-whole) decomposition of the holon's **carrier**. For a `U.System`, this is its physical composition (e.g., an engine is `ComponentOf` a car). For a `U.Episteme`, this is the structure of its `Symbol` carrier (e.g., a chapter is `ComponentOf` a book).
2.  **The Functional/Supervisory Hierarchy (Layers):** The decomposition of the management or reasoning task. This is a hierarchy of **`Transformer`s playing roles**. A `Transformer` in a higher layer (e.g., a scientific committee) `supervises` a `Transformer` in a lower layer (e.g., a research lab) by providing it with objectives or constraints.
3.  **The Dataflow Network:** The network of information exchange (`U.Interaction`) between these `Transformer`s in their respective roles (e.g., `funding decisions` flowing down, `research findings` flowing up).

Confusing these hierarchies leads to critical modeling errors. For example, treating a functional layer (a `U.Method` performed by a `Transformer`) as if it were a structural component (`ComponentOf` the holon it manages) is a category error that this pattern is designed to prevent.

**Archetypal Grounding**

The universal architecture of the Supervisor-Subsystem loop is instantiated differently depending on the nature of the holon being managed. Below are two detailed archetypes that illustrate this distinction.

#### **Archetype 1: Loop for a `U.System` (Robotic Swarm)**

Here, the loop governs the **physical behavior** of a collection of active `U.System`s.

*   **Meta-System:** A swarm of autonomous delivery drones.
*   **Sub-Holons:** The individual drones (`U.System`s).
*   **`Transformer`s:** Each drone is its own `Transformer`, executing its local flight `Method`. The Supervisor is also a `Transformer` (either a designated leader drone or a distributed consensus algorithm running on all drones).

**Instantiation of the Loop Roles and Principles:**

| Role/Principle | Instantiation in the Robotic Swarm |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Supervisor** | The **consensus algorithm** (`U.Method`) running across the swarm. Its `GenerativeModel ℳ` is a shared map of the delivery area and the real-time state of all drones. Its `Objective Ξ` is to "maximize fleet-wide delivery throughput." |
| **Sub-Holons**| The individual drones. |
| **Shared Medium**| A wireless mesh network (`U.Interaction` channel). |
| **Loop in Action:** | 1. **Sense:** Each drone reports its position, battery, and status. The Supervisor aggregates this into a global state `X`. <br> 2. **Judge:** The Supervisor compares `X` to the optimal fleet configuration `Ξ` from its model. The `Error Δ` is the deviation (e.g., coverage gaps, overloaded drones). <br> 3. **Plan:** The Supervisor's influence policy `Λ` computes a new set of target waypoints and speed commands (`Influence Signal α`) for individual drones. <br> 4. **Act/Adapt:** Each drone receives its new command `α` and adapts its local flight `Method` (`πᵢ`) to move towards its new waypoint. |
| **Stability Principles:** | **(P-C) Contraction:** The control law is designed so that the swarm exponentially converges to the target formation. <br> **(P-D) Dissipativity:** The system is dissipative; oscillations from a disturbance (like a sudden gust of wind) are actively dampened. <br> **(P-I) Information Constraint:** The loop is robust to a communication delay of `τ = 50ms`. |

#### **Archetype 2: Loop for a `U.Episteme` (A Scientific Theory)**

Here, the loop governs the **conceptual integrity and evolution** of a passive knowledge artifact (`U.Episteme`). The "actions" are not physical movements but acts of reasoning and revision performed by human `Transformer`s.

*   **Meta-System:** The entire body of knowledge known as "The Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection."
*   **Sub-Holons:** Individual epistemes that are `ConstituentOf` the theory, such as the Principle of Variation, the Principle of Inheritance, and the Principle of Selection.
*   **`Transformer`s:** The global scientific community in the relevant field.

**Instantiation of the Loop Roles and Principles:**

| Role/Principle | Instantiation for the Scientific Theory |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Supervisor** | The **peer-review process and the scientific method itself** (`U.Method`), enacted by the community (`Transformer`). Its `GenerativeModel ℳ` is the core set of axioms and principles of the theory. Its `Objective Ξ` is "to provide the most parsimonious and predictively powerful explanation for the diversity of life." |
| **Sub-Holons**| The constituent principles and supporting evidence (individual papers, datasets). |
| **Shared Medium**| Scientific journals, conferences, and preprint archives (`U.Interaction` channels). |
| **Loop in Action:** | 1. **Sense:** A research lab (`Transformer`) performs an experiment and publishes a new finding (`U.Observation`, e.g., evidence for horizontal gene transfer). <br> 2. **Judge:** The community (`Supervisor`) compares this new finding `X` with the current predictions of the theory `Ξ`. The `Error Δ` is the anomaly—a result that the current theory cannot easily explain. <br> 3. **Plan:** Other researchers (`Supervisor`) propose revisions to the theory (`Influence Signal α`, e.g., a new paper suggesting a modification to the "tree of life" model). <br> 4. **Act/Adapt:** Over time, if the new proposal is corroborated by further evidence, the community (`Transformer`) updates the canonical understanding of the theory. The core `U.Episteme` is refined. |
| **Stability Principles:** | **(P-C) Contraction:** A healthy scientific paradigm is contractive; it progressively reduces the set of unexplained anomalies. <br> **(P-D) Dissipativity:** The process is dissipative; flawed or unfalsifiable hypotheses are eventually "dampened" and discarded by the community. <br> **(P-B) Bilevel Optimization:** The global objective (explanatory power) guides the local work of individual labs. |

**Key Distinction:**

In the `U.System` example, the loop is a fast, often automated, **control system**. In the `U.Episteme` example, it is a slow, human-driven **process of collective reasoning**. However, the **architectural pattern is identical**: a supervisor monitors the state of sub-holons and issues corrective signals to maintain a global objective. This demonstrates the true universality of the LCA pattern.
 
 **Conformance Checklist**

*   **CC-B2.5.1 (Role Mandate):** Any model of a layered supervisory architecture **MUST** explicitly identify the holons (or `Transformer`s) playing the roles of `Supervisor` and `Sub-Holon`, as well as the `U.Interaction` channel that constitutes the `Shared Medium`.
*   **CC-B2.5.2 (Loop Closure Mandate):** The model **MUST** demonstrate a closed feedback loop. A one-way, open-loop command structure is not a conformant Supervisor-Subsystem loop.
*   **CC-B2.5.3 (Principle Evidence):** An assurance case for a supervisory loop **SHOULD** provide evidence, whether through formal proof, simulation, or empirical data, that it adheres to the four principles of stable control (Contraction, Dissipativity, Bilevel Optimization, Information Constraint).
*   **CC-B2.5.4 (Levels vs. Layers Distinction):** The model **MUST** maintain the formal distinction between the structural hierarchy of `Levels` (`ComponentOf`) and the functional hierarchy of `Layers` (`controls`/`supervises`).

**Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them**

| Anti-Pattern | Manager's View: What It Looks Like | How FPF Prevents It (Conceptually) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The "Ghost in the Machine"** | The model shows a collection of parts that somehow coordinate to achieve a global goal, but there is no identifiable mechanism or agent responsible for that coordination. | **CC-B2.5.1** forces the modeler to explicitly name the `Supervisor`. If no supervisor can be identified, then no supervisory loop exists, and the coordination is either an illusion or an un-modeled external factor. |
| **The "Functional Soup"** | A diagram mixes physical components and functional layers in the same hierarchy. The "Planning Layer" is shown as a "part of" the physical system. | **CC-B2.5.4** and the strict mereology of FPF (A.14) forbid this. A functional layer is realized *by* physical components, but it is not *part of* them. This prevents category errors. |
| **The "Perfect Communication" Fallacy** | The design of the control logic assumes that the supervisor has instant, infinite-bandwidth access to the state of all subsystems. The system fails in the real world due to network latency. | **Principle P-I (Information Constraint)** and its formal invariant **SSI-5** mandate that the stability analysis must account for the real-world constraints of the `Shared Medium`. |

**Consequences**

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Provable Stability and Robustness:** The pattern provides a path to creating complex, multi-agent systems that are not just functional but are provably stable and resilient to disturbances. | **Analytical Complexity:** Proving the formal invariants (SSI-1 to SSI-5) can be a non-trivial analytical or simulation task. *Mitigation:* For less critical systems, demonstrating adherence to the manager-facing criteria may be sufficient. The full formal proof is reserved for high-assurance applications. |
| **Composable Control:** A well-formed LCA, proven to be contractive and dissipative, can itself be treated as a stable "sub-holon" in an even higher-level supervisory loop. This enables the construction of deeply nested, yet manageable, control holarchies. | - |
| **Clear Architectural Roles:** The pattern provides a clear language (Supervisor, Sub-Holon, Shared Medium) for describing the roles and responsibilities within a complex supervisory architecture, improving communication between teams. | - |
| **Universal Applicability:** The pattern provides a single, unified conceptual tool for understanding control and regulation in systems as diverse as robotics, economics, and scientific communities. | - |

**Rationale**

This pattern distills the core insights of modern, post-2015 control theory and cybernetics into a universal, tool-agnostic architectural template. It recognizes that the classical, single-controller model is insufficient for the challenges of autonomy, collective intelligence, and large-scale socio-technical systems.

By formalizing the concepts of **Levels** vs. **Layers** and providing a set of universal stability principles (Contraction, Dissipativity, etc.), FPF creates a bridge between the abstract mathematics of control theory and the practical art of systems architecture. It provides a rigorous, first-principles answer to the fundamental question: "How do you build a complex, multi-part holon that reliably works together to achieve a common goal, without falling into chaos?" The pattern's true power lies in its universality: it reveals the congruent architectural logic that underpins effective supervision, whether that supervision is realized by a silicon chip, a nervous system, or a social contract.

**Relations**

*   **Is an elaboration of:** The "Supervisor Emergence" (S) trigger in `B.2 Meta-Holon Transition (MHT)`. This pattern describes the architecture of the supervisor that emerges during an MHT.
*   **Builds upon:** The `U.System`, `U.Method`, `U.Role`, and `U.Interaction` concepts from the FPF Kernel and Part A.
*   **Constrains:** The design of any `U.Method` intended to serve a supervisory function.
*   **Enables:** The creation of deep, multi-level holarchies where each level is itself a provably stable supervisory system.

## **B.3 Trust & Assurance Calculus (F–G–R with Congruence)** \[A]

> **Plain‑English headline.**
> B.3 defines how **assurance** (trust) is **computed and propagated** for both physical systems and knowledge artifacts, using a small set of **characteristics** and **conservative aggregation rules** that respect the Γ‑invariants and A.15 **Strict Distinction**. It treats the **Working‑Model layer** as the **publication surface** for claims, with assurance **attached downward** (Mapping · Logical · Constructive · Empirical) per E.14.

### 1) Context

Every non‑trivial result in FPF—*a composed system is safe*, *a model is credible*, *a conclusion holds*—is a **claim** that rests on **composed evidence**.

* For **U.System** holons (Γ\_sys), assurance is about *capabilities and constraints* under stated conditions.
* For **U.Episteme** holons (Γ\_epist), assurance is about the *quality of support* for a statement or model.

To make such claims comparable and auditable across domains, B.3 introduces a **Trust & Assurance Calculus** that:

* uses a **small characteristic space** (F–G–R) governed by CHR principles,
* accounts for **integration quality** via **Congruence Level (CL)** along the edges of a `DependencyGraph` (B.1.1, A.14),
* and composes these values with **Γ‑flavours** while respecting the **Invariant Quintet** (IDEM, COMM/LOC or their replacements, WLNK, MONO).

B.3 is **conceptual and normative**: it defines *what must be measured and how the measures propagate*. How you improve those measures (e.g., formalize, replicate, reconcile) is the job of KD‑CAL actions (the knowledge‑dynamics architheory; references are descriptive, not required to read here).

**Working‑Model handshake (alignment with E.14 · B.3.5 · C.13).**  
Assurance consumes two inputs declared at the **Working‑Model** surface (CT2R‑LOG, B.3.5): the **justification stance** `validationMode ∈ {postulate, inferential, axiomatic}` and, where present, the **grounding link** `tv:groundedBy`. Structural claims that aspire to the strongest guarantees rely on **Constructive** grounding as a **Γₘ** (Compose‑CAL) narrative referenced via `tv:groundedBy`. No assurance artefact **defines** Working‑Model wording or layout (downward‑only dependence, E.14).

### 2) Problem

Without a disciplined calculus, four chronic failures appear:

1. **Trust inflation:** Averaging or summing heterogeneous “quality” tags yields aggregates that look better than their weakest parts, violating WLNK.
2. **Scale confusion:** Mixing ordinal and ratio scales (e.g., averaging “formality levels” with numeric reliabilities) produces meaningless numbers.
3. **Congruence blindness:** Integration quality (how well pieces fit) is invisible; brilliantly strong parts connected by weak mappings produce overconfident wholes.
4. **Scope drift:** Design‑time formalism and run‑time evidence are composed into a single score; dashboards then claim “assurance” for a blueprint using live data, or vice versa.

---

### 3) Forces

| Force                                    | Tension                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conservatism vs. Synthesis**           | Avoid overclaiming (WLNK) ↔ allow real gains from better integration (raise CL) or true emergence (B.2).                            |
| **Universality vs. Domain nuance**       | One calculus for systems and epistemes ↔ physics and epistemology use different primitives; keep them comparable but not identical. |
| **Simplicity vs. Fidelity**              | Keep the characteristic space small (A.11) ↔ capture enough structure to be informative and improvable by KD‑CAL actions.           |
| **Static clarity vs. Dynamic evolution** | A score must be reproducible today ↔ tomorrow it should legitimately rise after formalization, replication, or reconciliation.      |

---

### 4) Solution — **Part 1: The characteristic space and the universal aggregation skeleton**

B.3 defines **what** to measure, **how** those measures live on nodes and edges of the dependency graph, and the **shape** of the aggregation that any Γ‑flavour must honor when producing an *assurance result*.

#### 4.1 The characteristic space (CHR‑compliant)

We standardize three characteristics on **nodes (holons)** plus one **edge** characteristic:

1. **Formality (F)** — *how constrained the reasoning is by explicit, proof‑grade structure.*

   * **Scale kind:** **ordinal** (levels do not admit arithmetic).
   * **Canonical levels (example):**
        `F0 Informal prose` · `F1 Structured narrative` · `F2 Formalizable schema` · `F3 Proof‑grade formalism`.
   * **Monotone direction:** higher is better (never lowers assurance when all else fixed).

2. **ClaimScope (G)** — *how broadly the result applies in the relevant domain space.*

   * **Scale kind:** **coverage / span** (set‑ or measure‑based; domain‑specific).
   * **Monotone direction:** larger, but only when **correctly supported** (see WLNK and CL below).

3. **Reliability (R)** — *how likely the claim/behavior holds under stated conditions.*

   * **Scale kind:** **ratio** in `[0,1]` (or a conservative ordinal proxy when numeric modeling is unavailable).
   * **Monotone direction:** higher is better.

4. **Congruence Level (CL)** — *edge property: how well two parts fit* (semantic alignment, calibration, interface contract).

   * **Scale kind:** **ordinal** with a **monotone penalty function** `Φ(CL)` where `Φ` decreases as CL increases.
   * **Canonical levels (example):**
     `CL0 weak guess` · `CL1 plausible mapping` · `CL2 validated mapping` · `CL3 verified equivalence`.
   * **Interpretation:** low CL reduces the credibility of the *integration itself* (not the parts), and therefore **penalizes** the aggregate **R**.

> **Strict Distinction (A.15).**
>
> * Characteristics live at **value level** (they qualify holons or edges conceptually), while Γ‑flavours fold **structure/order/time**.
> * Do not smuggle characteristics into structural edges; keep them explicit on nodes/edges as CHR metadata.

> **Assurance shoulders (Working‑Model split).**  
> **Mapping** raises **TA** (typing, fit/CL). **Logical** and **Constructive** contribute to **VA** (intended relation semantics; Γₘ extensional identity for structure). **Empirical Validation** contributes to **LA** (evidence in a bounded context). These supports attach **downward** from the Working‑Model surface (E.14).

#### 4.2 Assurance as a typed claim

B.3 speaks about **assurance of a specific typed claim** `C` over a holon `H` under context `K` and scope `S ∈ {design, run}`:

```
Assurance(H, C | K, S) = ⟨F_eff, G_eff, R_eff, Notes⟩
```

* `C` examples: *meets load L*, *argument Q holds*, *model M predicts within δ*.
* `K` binds assumptions (environment, usage, priors).
* `Notes` include the **SCR** (all sources, B.1.3), **OrderSpec/TimeWindow** where applicable (B.1.4), cutsets, and evidence citations (A.10).

This tuple gives readers an at‑a‑glance view (didactic primacy) while preserving the pieces needed for audit and improvement.

**Validation modes (declaration, normative).** 
Each published Working‑Model assertion **SHALL** declare **`validationMode ∈ {postulate, inferential, axiomatic}`** (E.14).  
— *postulate* → pragmatic working claim; **Empirical Validation** is **required** for audit.  
— *inferential* → reasoned consequence; **Logical** assurance carries the burden.  
— *axiomatic* → constructive identity; **structural** edges MUST provide a Γₘ narrative and a **`tv:groundedBy`** pointer (C.13, B.3.5).

**Design vs run (no chimeras).** Assurance tuples for **design‑time** and **run‑time** SHALL be reported **separately** and **not composed into a single score**; see the *Scope drift* hazard in §2 and the obligations in B.3.3.

#### 4.3 Where the numbers live (and do not)

* **On nodes:** each input holon contributes its local `F, G, R` according to its nature (system vs. episteme).
* **On edges:** each integration step has a `CL` (congruence of the connection).
* **Not inside Γ:** Γ consumes `D` and returns a composed holon; B.3 governs how `F, G, R, CL` **propagate** to the **Assurance** tuple for that composed holon. This keeps Γ algebra and assurance calculus **separable** and reviewable.

---

#### 4.4 Universal aggregation skeleton (domain‑neutral)

Any Γ‑flavour that claims an **Assurance** result **must** adopt the following **conservative skeleton**:

1. **Formality:**

   ```
   F_eff = min_i F_i
   ```

   *Rationale:* the least formal piece caps the formality of the whole (WLNK on F).
   *Monotone:* raising any `F_i` cannot reduce `F_eff`.

2. **ClaimScope:**

   ```
   G_eff = SpanUnion({G_i}) constrained by support
   ```

   * “SpanUnion” is a **set/coverage union** in the domain’s space.
   * **Constraint:** any region in the union **unsupported** by reliable parts is **dropped** (WLNK).
   * *Monotone:* adding supported span cannot reduce `G_eff`.

3. **Reliability (penalized by integration):**

   ```
   R_raw = min_i R_i                       // Weakest-link cap
   R_eff = max(0, R_raw − Φ(CL_min))       // Congruence penalty
   ```

   * `CL_min` is the **lowest** congruence level on any edge in the proof spine / critical integration region for the claim `C`.
   * `Φ` is **monotone decreasing** and **bounded** (never makes negative values).
   * *Monotone:* increasing any `R_i` or any `CL` cannot lower `R_eff`.

4. **SCR and Notes:**
   * The aggregate SHALL produce a SCR listing all contributing nodes and edges, with their F, G, R, CL, scopes, and evidence links (A.10).  
   * The SCR SHALL additionally surface the **aboutness** (`about(Object→TopicHolon)`) and the **ReferencePlane** for the claim, and present a **separable TA/VA/LA table** of evidence contributions with **valid_until/decay** marks and the **Epistemic‑Debt** per § B.3.4.  
   * If order/time mattered for the claim, attach the OrderSpec or TimeWindow identifiers (B.1.4).

This skeleton is **mandatory**. Domain‑specific architheories may add **refinements** (e.g., separate epistemic “replicability” vs. “calibration”) as long as they **do not violate** WLNK or MONO and preserve scale kinds.

---

#### 4.5 System vs. Episteme — same shape, different readings

* **For systems (Γ\_sys):**

  * `F` reads as **engineering discipline** (from ad‑hoc procedure to verified specification).
  * `G` reads as **operational envelope coverage**.
  * `R` reads as **assured reliability** under `K` (requirements, environment, test campaigns).
  * `CL` often arises at **interfaces** (Boundary‑Inheritance Contract; B.1.2): poorly controlled interfaces reduce `R_eff`.

* **For epistemes (Γ\_epist):**

  * `F` reads as **logical/semantic formality** (from prose to proof).
  * `G` reads as **domain span** (concepts, populations, conditions).
  * `R` reads as **evidential support** (replication quality, measurement integrity).
  * `CL` measures **semantic alignment** of merged constructs (terminology mapping, ontology bridges, calibration).

> **Agentness is separate (A.13).**
> Agency metrics (Agency‑CHR) **do not enter the skeleton by default**. They may act as a **contextual overlay** (e.g., to argue why a supervisory policy can maintain `R` across disturbances), but **never** to bypass **WLNK** or the **CL penalty**. Grade shifts should be modeled as **MHT** events when they create new capabilities.

---

#### 4.6 Scale discipline (CHR guard‑rails)

To prevent silent misuse:

* **Ordinal scales (F, CL):** never average or subtract; only `min`/`max`, thresholds, and monotone comparisons are allowed.
* **Coverage scales (G):** use union/intersection in a declared domain space; do not “average” sets. If a numeric proxy is used (e.g., coverage ratio), it **must** be derived from a set operation, not vice versa.
* **Ratio scales (R):** may be combined with `min`, `max`, or **explicitly justified** conservative functions; do not add R’s from different contexts without normalization of `K` (assumptions).

---

#### 4.7 What improves the tuple (action patterns, high‑level)

B.3 remains neutral about *how* improvement happens, but for didactic clarity:

* **Raise F:** formalize narratives (specifications, machine‑checked models).
* **Raise G:** enlarge supported span (new test regimes, new populations) with adequate evidence.
* **Raise R:** replicate, calibrate, tighten measurement error, reduce bias.
* **Raise CL:** reconcile vocabularies, align units, formalize mappings, verify interface contracts.

Each of these corresponds to recognizable **Transformer roles** and KD‑CAL moves (design‑time); their **run‑time** counterparts are covered by Γ\_time (phase evidence) and Γ\_work (cost of obtaining assurance).

### 5) Proof obligations (attach these when producing an Assurance tuple)

These obligations refine the generic Proof Kit from **B.1.1 §6** for **assurance** outputs. Each Γ‑flavour that emits an *Assurance(H, C | K, S)* tuple MUST attach the applicable obligations below.

#### 5.1 Common obligations (all Γ‑flavours)

* **ASS‑CLM (Typed claim & context).**
  State the **claim** `C` (what is being assured), the **context** `K` (assumptions, environment), and the **scope** `S ∈ {design, run}`.

* **ASS‑SCA (Scale discipline).**
  Declare the **scale kind** used for each characteristic (F ordinal, G coverage, R ratio) and confirm that all operations are **admissible** for that kind (no averaging of ordinals; G via set/coverage ops).

* **ASS‑WLNK (Weakest‑link evidence).**
  Identify the **cutset** (node or edge set) that caps F/G/R for the claim (the proof spine for epistemes, the structural or assurance bottleneck for systems).

* **ASS‑CL (Congruence path).**
  Identify the **relevant integration path(s)** and record `CL_min` used in the penalty `Φ(CL_min)`.

* **ASS‑MAN (SCR).**
  Produce a **SCR** listing all contributing nodes and edges with `(F, G, R)` and `CL` values, their **temporalScope**, and evidence anchors (A.10). If order or time were material, include the **OrderSpec** or **TimeWindow** identifiers from **B.1.4**.

* **ASS‑MONO (Declared monotone characteristics).**
  List the characteristics along which local improvement cannot reduce the aggregate (this supports future evolution, B.4).

#### 5.2 Γ\_sys (systems) — additional obligations

* **CORE‑BIC (Interface congruence).**
  Reference the **Boundary‑Inheritance Contract** (BIC) from **B.1.2** and record any interface mismatches; these contribute to `CL_min`.

* **CORE‑ENV (Operating envelope).**
  Specify the domain used for **G** (e.g., load–temperature region) and how coverage is computed (set union constrained by support).

#### 5.3 Γ\_epist (epistemes) — additional obligations

* **EPI‑SPN (Entailment spine).**
  Identify the **premise/lemma spine** for the claim; `R_raw = min R_i` is taken along this spine, not over arbitrary satellites.

* **EPI‑MAP (Semantic mapping congruence).**
  Point to the **vocabulary/ontology mappings** used; their verification status sets the **CL** levels on the integration edges.

#### 5.4 Γ\_ctx / Γ\_method (order‑sensitive) — additional obligations

* **CTX‑ORD (OrderSpec).**
  Attach the partial or total order `σ` and any **join‑soundness** conditions (types, pre/post‑conditions).
  (See B.1.4 for NC‑1..3 invariants; B.1.5 adds duration/capability typing.)

#### 5.5 Γ\_time (temporal) — additional obligations

* **TIME‑COV (Coverage & identity).**
  Show that `PhaseOf` intervals cover the declared window without overlap for the **same carrier**; justify any gap/overlap explicitly.

> **Note on Γ\_work.**
> Resource spending and efficiency live in **Γ\_work**. Their *measurement integrity* can influence **R** for a claim (e.g., if a reliability figure depends on calibrated energy input), but **costs themselves are not assurance**; keep them in Γ\_work and cite their **measurement assurance** as inputs here.

### 8) Anti‑patterns and repairs

| Anti‑pattern             | Symptom                                                    | Repair                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Averaging assurance**  | Mean of `R_i` reported as system reliability               | Use `min R_i` on the cutset, then apply `Φ(CL_min)`.                                                           |
| **Ordinal arithmetic**   | Averaging `F` or `CL` to produce “2.3”                     | Use `min`/`max` or thresholds; never average ordinals.                                                         |
| **Coverage as centroid** | Replacing `G` union with a single “typical point”          | Keep `G` as set/coverage; if a numeric proxy is needed, derive it from the set.                                |
| **Ignoring congruence**  | No penalty for weak mappings/interfaces                    | Assign `CL` to integration edges; apply `Φ(CL_min)`.                                                           |
| **Design/run chimera**   | “One score” mixing blueprint and telemetry                 | Split into `S=design` and `S=run` tuples; compare explicitly.                                                  |
| **Agency override**      | Claiming higher assurance because a controller is “clever” | Agency may justify *how* improvements are achieved; it cannot remove WLNK or `Φ`.                              |
| **MemberOf as stock**    | Using `MemberOf` to sum reliabilities                      | Keep `MemberOf` for collections; reliability comes from the relevant **Γ** composition (e.g., Γ\_sys cutset). |

### 9) Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Comparable, conservative, improvable.** The tuple ⟨F, G, R⟩ with **edge‑level CL** gives a compact, auditable view that improves monotonically under targeted actions (formalize, replicate, reconcile).
* **Cross‑scale coherence.** Works for assemblies and arguments, procedures and histories, without leaking order/time/cost into structure.
* **Clear upgrade paths.** It is obvious **what to do** to raise each component (raise F/G/R locally or raise CL on the glue).

**Trade‑offs**

* **More explicit metadata.** You must state scale kinds, cutsets, and mapping congruence; this is intentional transparency.
* **Conservatism may feel pessimistic.** True synergy appears only via **MHT** or after raising CL—never by arithmetic optimism.

---

### 10) Rationale (informative)

B.3 distills mature post‑2015 practice across several fields into a single, small calculus:

* **Assurance by weakest link** reflects reliability engineering and safety cases in complex systems; composing claim strength by minima prevents over‑statement.
* **Formality and verifiability** mirror advances in model‑based engineering and formal verification, where raising F turns subjective arguments into verifiable artifacts.
* **Coverage as set/measure** follows evidence synthesis and validation practice that treat applicability as a domain region, not a scalar to “average.”
* **Congruence on edges** captures what meta‑analysis, interface control, and ontology alignment have repeatedly shown: integration quality is often the real bottleneck. Penalizing low‑CL is a principled way to prevent silent over‑confidence while rewarding verified reconciliation.

This arrangement preserves **A.11 Parsimony** (few characteristics), aligns with **A.14/A.15** (clear separation of structure, order, time, cost, values), and leaves Context for domain‑specific refinements that do not break the invariants.

> **One‑page takeaway.**
> Report assurance as **⟨F, G, R⟩** for a **typed claim** under explicit **context/scope**, and penalize by the **lowest edge‑level congruence**.
> Improve assurance by raising **F**, **G**, **R**, or **CL**—and keep order, time, and cost in their own lanes.

### **Pattern B.3.3 — Assurance Subtypes & Levels [D]**

**Context**

A complex project may generate hundreds of artifacts: design specifications, simulation models, test suites, and operational logs. While the Trust & Assurance Calculus provides a framework for evaluating these artifacts, teams often face a critical challenge: how to aggregate this diverse evidence into a single, meaningful signal of an artifact's maturity. Simply counting the number of tests or documents can lead to "paper compliance," where an artifact appears well-supported but has critical, unexamined weaknesses in its formal structure or conceptual alignment.

**Problem**

How do we create an objective, auditable, and balanced contract for what constitutes "trustworthiness" at each stage of an artifact's development cycle? FPF requires a mechanism that moves beyond simple evidence counting to a qualitative assessment of assurance. This mechanism must prevent common failure modes, such as over-investing in run-time validation (LA) at the expense of design-time verification (VA), or neglecting the critical work of ensuring concepts are correctly mapped and typed (TA).

**Solution**

FPF establishes a formal contract that links three distinct **Assurance Subtypes** to three computable **Assurance Levels**. An artifact's level is not assigned manually by an author; it is **derived automatically** by its anchored evidence. This creates a transparent and falsifiable system for tracking an artifact's journey from a speculative idea to a robust, reliable holon.

**1. Assurance Subtypes: The Three Pillars of Trust**

These three subtypes categorize the kind of question an assurance activity answers, ensuring a balanced approach to building confidence.

| Subtype | Code | Core Question | Links to Epistemic Score | Manager's View: What It Prevents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Typing Assurance** | TA | “Does the artifact faithfully represent its intended concept?” | **CL** (Congruence Level) | **Miscommunication & Integration Failures.** TA ensures that when a requirement says "Sensor," the design model's "Sensor" component is the same conceptual thing. This activity directly improves the Congruence Level (CL) of the integration *edges* between artifacts. |
| **Verification Assurance**| VA | “Is the holon logically correct under its stated assumptions?” | **FV** (Formal Verifiability)| **"It Works on Paper" Errors.** VA catches design flaws, logical inconsistencies, and specification errors before a single line of code is written or a physical part is machined. It ensures the blueprint is sound. |
| **Validation Assurance**| LA | “Does the holon work correctly in the real world?” | **EV** (Empirical Validability)| **"Works in the Lab, Fails in the Field" Surprises.** LA confirms that the holon performs as expected under real or simulated operational conditions, accounting for noise, unexpected inputs, and environmental factors. |

**2. Computed Assurance Levels: The Ladder of Maturity**

An artifact’s level is computed based on the evidence it has accumulated. This creates a clear, step-by-step path for increasing trust.

| Level | Name | How It Is Computed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Level 0** | **Unsubstantiated** | No `verifiedBy` or `validatedBy` evidence is present. The artifact is a claim or an idea. |
| **Level 1** | **Substantiated** | At least one `verifiedBy` or `validatedBy` link to an evidence artifact exists, and the artifact is supported by Typing Assurance (TA). |
| **Level 2** | **Axiomatic** | The artifact is `verifiedBy` either a proof **or** a **Compose‑CAL (Γₘ) constructive narrative** that the author has linked from the Working‑Model via `tv:groundedBy` (CT2R‑LOG). Its FormalVerifiabilityScore (FV) meets or exceeds a pre‑defined threshold. Additionally, if the holon is designated as safety‑critical, it **MUST** also be supported by **Validation Assurance (LA)**. For non‑critical holons, LA is strongly recommended (`SHOULD`). |

> **Didactic Note for Managers: What 'Level 1' Really Means**
>
> Think of moving from Level 0 to Level 1 as the first step toward professional seriousness.
>
> *   **Level 0** is an idea on a whiteboard. It has potential, but no receipts.
> *   **Level 1** means you have **at least one receipt**. You have anchored the idea to something concrete: a passing test, a formal sketch, a simulation result. It's no longer just an opinion.
>
> Crucially, Level 1 also demands **Typing Assurance (TA)**. This sounds technical, but its business impact is simple: **it means you've named your terms correctly and consistently**. You've used the Role-Projection Bridge (Pattern B.5) to ensure that the "Sensor" in your requirements document is the same "Sensor" in your architectural diagram. This basic alignment work is what prevents costly integration failures and endless meetings where teams talk past each other. Good typing is the foundation of clear communication, and at Level 1, FPF makes it mandatory.

**Conformance Checklist**

To ensure the integrity of the assurance calculus, the following rules are normative. A **Target of Assurance (ToA)** is any working-model element designated as a root claim (e.g., a top-level system requirement, safety goal, or core hypothesis).

*   **CC-B3.3.1 (L1 Anchor Mandate):** A ToA **SHALL NOT** be considered to have reached `AssuranceLevel:L1` unless it is linked to at least one evidence artifact via `verifiedBy` or `validatedBy`.
*   **CC-B3.3.2 (L1 Typing Mandate):** A ToA at `AssuranceLevel:L1` or higher **MUST** be supported by **Typing Assurance (TA)**. This includes, at a minimum, that its core concepts are mapped via the Role-Projection bridge (Pattern B.5) and it conforms to its declared schema.
*   **CC-B3.3.3 (L2 V&V Mandate):** A ToA at `AssuranceLevel:L2` **MUST** satisfy all L1 criteria. In addition, it **MUST** be supported by **Verification Assurance (VA)** with `FV ≥ threshold_FV`. For holons designated as safety-critical (e.g., `criticality ≥ SIL-2`), the ToA **MUST** also be supported by **Validation Assurance (LA)** with `EV > 0`. For non-critical holons, LA **SHOULD** be present.
    *   *Exemption Note:* Purely formal artifacts (e.g., mathematical axioms) may justify an exemption from the LA requirement, provided this is documented in their rationale.
*   **CC-B3.3.4 (Concept-Bridge Completeness):** For any architheory used in a model at `AssuranceLevel:L1` or higher, all of its mandatory U.Types **MUST** be mapped to domain concepts via the Role-Projection bridge (Pattern B.5).
*   **CC-B3.3.5 (Scope Separation):** Assurance claims **MUST** maintain a strict separation between `design-time` and `run-time` scopes (Pattern A.4). An assurance tuple for a `MethodDescription` (design-time) SHALL NOT be conflated with one for its corresponding `Work`/`Trace` (run-time). The evidence anchors (`verifiedBy`, `validatedBy`) must point to artifacts of the appropriate scope.
* **CC-B3.3.6 (CT2R‑LOG Handshake):** If a ToA depends on **structural** claims, those claims **SHALL** be published as **Working‑Model** relations and, when used to justify `L2`, **SHALL** declare `validationMode=axiomatic` and provide **Constructive** grounding with `tv:groundedBy → Γₘ.(sum|set|slice)` (see B.3.5 and C.13).  
* **CC-B3.3.7 (Downward‑Only Dependence):** Assurance artefacts (Mapping/Logical/Constructive/Evidence) **SHALL NOT** impose vocabulary or layout back onto the Working‑Model surface (E.14).
 
**Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them**

| Anti-Pattern | Manager's View: What It Looks Like | How FPF Prevents It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The "Tested but Untyped" Mess** | "Our code has 100% test coverage, but we still have integration bugs and nobody understands what the architheories do." | **CC-B3.3.2** makes Typing Assurance (TA) mandatory for L1. You cannot claim your work is "Substantiated" without first ensuring your terms and concepts are clear and consistently mapped. |
| **The "Perfect Blueprint, Flawed Reality"** | "The design was formally proven to be perfect, but the physical product failed catastrophically in the field." | **CC-B3.3.3** mandates Validation Assurance (LA) for safety-critical systems at L2. A perfect blueprint (`FV=4`) is not enough; you must also provide empirical evidence (`EV>0`) that it works in the real world. |
| **The "Paper Compliance" Shell Game** | "We have thousands of documents and links, so we must be at a high assurance level." | The computed `AssuranceLevel` is not based on the *quantity* of evidence but on its *type* and *quality* (via FV/EV scores). You cannot reach L2 without strong formal verification (VA), no matter how much validation (LA) you do. |

**Consequences**

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Objective Gatekeeping:** The rules provide a clear, objective, and falsifiable basis for an artifact's assurance status, eliminating subjective judgment and "assurance theater." | **Risk of Over-stringency:** The rules might feel too strict for rapid prototypes. *Mitigation:* The requirements for `L1` are deliberately lightweight, demanding only one piece of evidence and basic typing, making the first step onto the ladder accessible. |
| **Balanced Assurance:** The contract requires a mix of evidence types for higher levels, preventing teams from over-investing in one area (e.g., testing) while neglecting another (e.g., formal specification). | **Risk of Evidence Inflation:** Teams might add trivial evidence just to meet the criteria. *Mitigation:* The quality of evidence is assessed via the epistemic scores (FV, EV, CL); merely linking to low-quality evidence will not significantly raise the scores needed for L2. |
| **Clear Progress Tracking:** The ladder provides a clear roadmap for maturing an artifact from an idea to a fully assured component, making planning and progress monitoring transparent. | **Overhead for Complex Holons:** A holon with many ToAs may require significant assurance work. *Mitigation:* The framework allows grouping, where a parent claim's evidence can satisfy the coverage requirements for its children if explicitly declared. |

**Rationale**

This pattern transforms the assurance framework from a descriptive taxonomy into a prescriptive, actionable contract. By binding the computed `AssuranceLevel` to mandatory, well-defined evidence coverage, it makes the notion of "trustworthiness" in FPF an objective and auditable property. The rules ensure that as an artifact's formality and claimed reliability increase, the rigor and balance of its supporting evidence increase in lockstep, operationalizing the principle of "no blind trust." The separation of `design-time` and `run-time` evidence, mandated by CC-B3.3.5, further ensures that claims made about a blueprint are not confused with claims made about a running system, preserving the integrity of the entire lifecycle.

**Relations**

*   **Builds on:** `B.3.1 Characteristic & Epistemic Spaces`, `A.10 Evidence Anchoring`, `A.4 Temporal Duality`.
*   **Constrains:** The computation and interpretation of `AssuranceLevel` for all holons.
*   **Enables:** Objective quality gates in the Canonical Evolution Loop (B.4) and reliable inputs for the Trust-Aware Mediation Calculus (D.4).

### B.3.4 — Evidence Decay & Epistemic Debt \[A] 

**Context**

The FPF assurance model (Pattern B.3.3) provides a robust framework for building trust in holons by anchoring claims to a rich body of evidence. However, it implicitly treats this evidence as timeless. A proof verified today is assumed to hold forever; a validation test run last year is given the same weight as one run yesterday. This assumption is dangerously flawed in any dynamic environment.

Consider a bridge certified in 1980. The assurance case, resting on evidence about steel fatigue from that era, would be considered highly reliable *at that time*. Today, after decades of environmental change, new material science insights, and an entirely different traffic load, would we still trust that original certification without re-evaluation? The context has drifted, and the original evidence has lost its relevance. FPF requires a formal mechanism to account for this natural decay of trust.

**Problem**

Without a calculus for evidence aging, FPF models are vulnerable to three critical failure modes:

1.  **Silent Risk Accumulation:** Trust silently decays. A component's high `AssuranceLevel` can become an illusion, resting on foundational evidence that is no longer valid in the current operational context. When aggregated, this stale trust propagates upwards, creating a seemingly robust system-of-systems that is, in fact, incredibly brittle.
2.  **Audit Illusion:** An artifact can pass an audit with flying colors, showing a complete set of anchors to high-quality evidence, yet be fundamentally untrustworthy because that evidence is obsolete. This leads to a false sense of security and undermines the very purpose of the assurance case.
3.  **Maintenance Paralysis:** Without a systematic way to flag stale evidence, re-validation efforts are often misdirected. Teams either engage in costly, unfocused re-testing of everything, or, more commonly, do nothing, allowing epistemic debt to accumulate until a failure forces a crisis.

| **Timeless Truth vs. Contextual Reality** | Formal proofs and logical derivations feel permanent and universal, yet the assumptions they make about the world are context-dependent and perishable. |
| **Rigor vs. Agility** | Continuously re-validating every piece of evidence is prohibitively expensive and would paralyze any agile workflow. |
| **Transparency vs. Cognitive Load** | We need to make the "staleness" of evidence visible, but we must do so without overwhelming teams with a constant barrage of decay alerts. |
| **Governance vs. Flexibility** | There must be a formal method for managing aging evidence, yet teams need the autonomy to make risk-informed decisions about when to accept, refresh, or deprecate it. |

**Solution**

FPF introduces a formal freshness model and a governance loop that make evidence aging a first-class, manageable property of the assurance calculus.

**1. The Principle of Perishable Evidence**

The core of the solution is a new normative principle: **Evidence is perishable**. The relevance of any piece of evidence is a function of time and context. An `AssuranceLevel` is therefore not a permanent achievement but a state that must be actively maintained.

**2. Mechanism 1: The Freshness Contract (`valid_until`)**

Every evidence artifact anchored in the Assurance Layer **MUST** carry a `valid_until` attribute.

*   **`valid_until: ISO-8601-date | null`**
*   This attribute acts as a "best before" date, explicitly stating the time horizon over which its creators consider it to be fully relevant without review.
*   A value of `null` signifies that the evidence is considered **perpetual**. This is reserved for artifacts like mathematical axioms or fundamental physical laws whose validity is not expected to decay on engineering timescales.

**3. Mechanism 2: The Epistemic Debt Metric (ED)**

When the current time `t` surpasses an evidence artifact's `valid_until` date, that artifact begins to accrue **Epistemic Debt (ED)**.

*   **Definition:** Epistemic Debt is a quantitative measure of an artifact's "staleness." It is a function of its age past its expiry date.
*   **Purpose:** ED is not a penalty but a **signal**. It makes the invisible risk of relying on old evidence visible and measurable.

**4. Mechanism 3: The Governance Loop (`Refresh / Deprecate / Waive`)**

Epistemic Debt is managed through a project-level **epistemic_debt_budget**. When the total accrued debt exceeds this budget, an alert is triggered, and the team **MUST** take one of three actions:

| Action | What It Means | Manager's View: The Practical Consequence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Refresh** | Produce new, up-to-date evidence and set a new `valid_until` date. | **"We invest the resources to re-validate."** This is the engineering fix: run the tests again, update the model, re-certify the component. |
| **Deprecate**| Acknowledge that the evidence is no longer valid and formally downgrade the `AssuranceLevel` of the dependent artifact (typically to `L0` or `L1`). | **"We accept the risk by lowering the component's official status."** The component is no longer considered fully assured and may be flagged for restricted use until it is refreshed. |
| **Waive** | A designated authority (e.g., a senior systems engineer or a safety officer) formally accepts the risk of using the stale evidence for a limited time. | **"I am signing off on this risk, for now."** This is a temporary, auditable override. It keeps the project moving but makes the risk acceptance explicit and assigns responsibility. |

> **Didactic Note for Managers: Managing Your "Trust Budget"**
>
> Think of Epistemic Debt exactly like financial or technical debt. It’s not inherently evil, but it must be managed. The FPF dashboard now includes a "Trust Health" meter.
>
> *   **Green:** Your evidence is fresh. Your assurance case is solid.
> *   **Amber:** Epistemic Debt is accumulating. It's time to plan for re-validation work in the next sprint.
> *   **Red:** Your debt has exceeded its budget. Your CI/CD pipeline might be issuing warnings, and you are now carrying un-budgeted risk. You must immediately decide: **Pay it down (Refresh), write it off (Deprecate), or take out a short-term, high-visibility loan (Waive).**
>
> This loop transforms the vague problem of "keeping things up to date" into a concrete, resource-managed, and auditable engineering process.

**5. Mechanism 4: The Epistemic Debt (ED) Calculation & Aggregation**

To make ED a useful leading indicator, it must be computed and aggregated consistently.

*   **Calculation:** For a single evidence artifact `i`, its debt at time `t` is a function of its age past expiry:
    `ED_t(i) = k * max(0, t - valid_until_i)`
    *   The coefficient `k` is a configurable linear decay factor (default: `1.0 per day`), allowing projects to tune the "interest rate" on their debt.

*   **Aggregation:** The total ED for an artifact `A` is the sum of the debt from all its direct and transitive evidence anchors:
    `ED_t(A) = Σ_i ED_t(evidence_i)`
    *   This rule ensures that debt propagates up the holarchy. If a foundational component's validation expires, the entire system that depends on it inherits that debt.

*   **Impact on Assurance Level:** When an artifact's total `ED_t(A)` exceeds a defined threshold (typically `> 0` unless waived), its computed `AssuranceLevel` is **provisionally downgraded by one level**. For example, an `L2` artifact with expired evidence is treated as `L1` for governance and risk purposes until the debt is resolved. This makes the consequence of inaction immediate and visible on project dashboards.

**Conformance Checklist**

*   **CC-ED.1 (Freshness Mandate):** Every evidence artifact anchored via `verifiedBy` or `validatedBy` **MUST** include a `valid_until` attribute. A value of `null` (perpetual) **MUST** be justified in the artifact's rationale.
*   **CC-ED.2 (Debt Budget Mandate):** Every project or `U.System` at `AssuranceLevel:L1` or higher **MUST** declare an `epistemic_debt_budget` in its manifest.
*   **CC-ED.3 (Aggregation Mandate):** The total Epistemic Debt of a composite holon **MUST** be the sum of the debt of its constituent parts, consistent with the aggregation rule `ED_t(S) = Σ_j ED_t(child_j)`.
*   **CC-ED.4 (Downgrade Mandate):** An artifact with `ED_t > epistemic_debt_budget` **SHALL** have its effective `AssuranceLevel` provisionally downgraded until the debt is resolved via `Refresh`, `Deprecate`, or `Waive`.
*   **CC-ED.5 (Waiver Auditability):** Any `Waive` action **MUST** be recorded as a formal, auditable event, citing the responsible authority, the rationale, and a new, short-term expiry date for the waiver itself.

**Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them**

| Anti-Pattern | Manager's View: What It Looks Like | How FPF Prevents It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The "Perpetual Evidence" Fallacy** | "We verified this component five years ago, so it's still L2. It's just a simple library, nothing has changed." | **CC-ED.1** forces a `valid_until` date. The context (compiler versions, new vulnerabilities, OS updates) has certainly changed. Setting `valid_until: null` requires explicit justification that the artifact is truly timeless, like a mathematical theorem. |
| **The "Invisible Debt" Trap** | A critical, low-level component's test suite has been failing silently for months, but the high-level system dashboard is still green. | **CC-ED.3** ensures that the debt from the failing component's expired evidence propagates up to the system level, turning the dashboard amber or red and forcing attention. |
| **The "Risk Acceptance by Silence"** | "We know those tests are stale, but we're too busy to fix them. Let's just ignore the warnings for now." | **CC-ED.5** makes risk acceptance an explicit, auditable action. A manager must formally `Waive` the debt, putting their name on the decision. This transforms passive neglect into active, accountable risk management. |

**Consequences**

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lifecycle Honesty:** The framework provides a transparent, quantitative way to track the erosion of trust over time, preventing "assurance rot." | **Process Overhead:** Teams must now manage `valid_until` dates and respond to debt alerts. *Mitigation:* Tooling can automate much of this, suggesting default expiry dates based on artifact type and providing one-click actions for the governance loop. |
| **Risk-Informed Maintenance:** Epistemic Debt becomes a leading indicator for maintenance and re-validation planning, allowing teams to allocate resources proactively, not reactively. | **Risk of False Positives:** Overly aggressive decay coefficients (`k`) could create excessive noise. *Mitigation:* The `k` value is configurable, and the `Waive` mechanism provides a safety valve for situations where a formal refresh is not yet warranted. |
| **Enhanced Auditability:** The entire state progression of evidence—from creation to expiry and resolution—is now a traceable, auditable part of the FPF model. | - |

**Rationale**

Knowledge frameworks that ignore time degrade silently. By embedding entropy accounting (epistemic debt) directly into the assurance calculus, FPF gains a self-regulating "immune system." This pattern operationalizes the common-sense insight that evidence is perishable, transforming maintenance from an ad-hoc, often-neglected chore into a budgeted, auditable, and risk-informed engineering activity. It complements the human-centric loop of ADR-014 and the pragmatic utility guardrail of ADR-015 by ensuring that what we trust today remains trustworthy tomorrow.

**Relations**

*   **Builds on:** `B.3.3 Assurance Subtypes & Levels`, `A.10 Evidence Anchoring`.
*   **Constrains:** The temporal validity of `AssuranceLevel` for all holons.
*   **Enables:** Proactive maintenance planning within the Canonical Evolution Loop (B.4) and provides a dynamic risk input for ethical and strategic decision-making (Part D).

## B.3.5 · **CT2R‑LOG — Working-Model Relations & Grounding** *(LOG‑use)*

> **One‑line summary.**
> CT2R‑LOG treats the everyday **Working‑Model relations**— **ut:ComponentOf**, **ut:MemberOf**, **ut:PortionOf**, **ut:AspectOf** —as the **publication surface** for structure, while binding each published edge to a **grounding trace** and a **declared `tv:validationMode`**. Authors keep using a short list of relations; reviewers get reconstructible provenance.

### 1) Intent

*Provide a single, human‑facing family of **Working‑Model** relations as the **publication surface**, with explicit hooks for (G) grounding and (R) reliability—without exposing constructor jargon or burdening day‑to‑day authors.*

**What you get (manager/engineer view).**
 The same relations you already know (e.g., **ComponentOf**) remain the **public interface**.

**What changes (auditor/ontologist view).**
* Each published edge carries two additional commitments:

  1. **`tv:groundedBy`** → points to a **reconstructible trace** (e.g., `Γ_m.sum`) whenever the edge is *structural*.
  2. **`validationMode ∈ {axiomatic, inferential, postulate}`** → declares how the author justifies the assertion.

This is the **alias‑plus‑grounding** split: **Compose‑CAL** builds the trace; **CT2R‑LOG** declares the alias pattern and links it; **Lang‑CHR** supplies the labels.

### 2) Context & forces (why this pattern exists)

* **Two audiences, one dial.** Project managers want **one relation family** and stable views; ontologists want **generative completeness** and extensional identity.
* **Parsimony constraint.** The Kernel stays minimal; construction is **outside** the Kernel.
* **Unification inside FPF.** We already unify external vocabularies; the same discipline is applied **internally** so *every* architheory that needs mereology rides on **one generative basis** and **one alias façade**.

---

### 3) Problem

Declared sub‑relations of `ut:PartOf` (e.g., **ComponentOf**, **MemberOf**) are easy to use but **not self‑justifying**: nothing in their declaration shows *why* a given edge should be trusted, or how to **re‑derive** it if challenged. Conversely, exposing constructor traces everywhere makes the graph unreadable to non‑specialists.

**We need**: a stable **publication surface** for relations *and* a mandatory, **reconstructible** **grounding channel**—plus a visible **validation intent** that downstream assurance can reason about.

---

### 4) Solution (thumbnail)

CT2R‑LOG introduces a **two‑link discipline** around each canonical edge:

1. **Alias link (concept‑level).**
   **Working‑Model relations** (e.g., `ut:ComponentOf`) are **alias patterns** over a general constructional principle. Denote by **`tv:AliasOf`**.

2. **Grounding link (evidence‑level).**
   Each **edge instance** carries **`tv:groundedBy`**:

   * **MANDATORY** for **all structural edges** (sub-properties of `ut:StructPartOf`): the target is a valid **`Γ_m` trace** from **Compose-CAL** (one of `sum`, `set`, `slice`). **Set** `validationMode=axiomatic`; **`postulate` SHALL NOT be used for structural edges**.
   * **Optional** for **epistemic edges** (e.g., `ConstituentOf`, `RepresentationOf`): if no `Γ_m` trace is appropriate, attach an **evidence object** whose admissibility is governed by the declared **`validationMode ∈ {inferential, postulate}`** (assurance rules).

2. **Validation flag (author intent).**
   Every declared edge or aggregation rule carries **`tv:validationMode`** with one of:
   * **`postulate`** — pragmatic working claim backed by observations;
   * **`inferential`** — reasoned consequence (proof outline);
   * **`axiomatic`** — constructive grounding via a `Γ_m.*` composition.

> **F–G–R alignment.**
> **F** (the published *Fact*): `:PumpA ut:ComponentOf :Skid12`.
> **G** (its *Grounding*): `:e123 tv:groundedBy :trace_Γm_sum_456`.
> **R** (declared *Reliability mode*): `tv:validationMode=axiomatic` → inputs B.3.3’s **AssuranceLevel** assessment.

### 5) Vocabulary & notation (normative)

* **Working-Model relations (front‑stage).**
 `ut:ComponentOf`, `ut:PortionOf`, `ut:AspectOf` are **publication-grade** sub-properties of `ut:StructPartOf` **(structural)**; `ut:MemberOf` is a sub-property of `ut:EpiPartOf` **(epistemic)**. 

* **Alias principle (lexical).**
  `tv:AliasOf` links a **relation type** to its **generative rule schema** (e.g., “`ComponentOf` aliases the result of a `Γ_m.sum` with role=component”).

* **Grounding (per‑edge).**
 `tv:groundedBy` on an *edge instance* **MUST** point to a **Γₘ trace** (`sum|set|slice`) for **structural** edges (**set** `validationMode=axiomatic`); for **epistemic** edges it **MAY** point to an **evidence object** or a logical proof per declared `validationMode ∈ {inferential, postulate}`. 

* **Trace family.**
  `Γ_m.sum`, `Γ_m.set`, `Γ_m.slice` are the only normative constructors for structural grounding; no temporal or workflow constructor is added here (time slices live in Sys‑CAL; parallelism via `set`).

* **Validation flag.**
 `tv:validationMode ∈ {postulate, inferential, axiomatic}` is **required** on every declared edge or aggregation rule; **for structural edges `postulate` is disallowed**.

### 6) Running example (didactic)

> **Story.** A refinery team publishes `:PumpA ut:ComponentOf :Skid12`.

* **Publication — Working-Model surface.**
  They mint one edge with the **Working-Model** relation **ComponentOf** and **declare the surface’s `U.Formality`** (typically **F≈F3**, controlled narrative). Only the publication surface is visible to readers.

* **Constructive grounding (Γₘ).**
  In the background, the edge node records `tv:groundedBy :trace_Γₘ_sum_456`. That trace is a **Compose-CAL** “sum” that lists the parts aggregated into the skid. Any auditor can **replay** the trace to prove extensional identity. *(Grounding does not change the surface’s F; it sets `validationMode=axiomatic` and contributes to **R** in the **VA** lane.)*

* **Assurance stance & R-lane.**
 Because the edge is construction-backed, authors set `tv:validationMode=axiomatic`. B.3.3 reads the flag and assigns an **AssuranceLevel** in the appropriate **R** lane (scale defined in B.3.3). **F**, **G**, and **R** remain **orthogonal**: this move raises assurance without changing claim scope (**G**) or the surface’s formality (**F**).

* **Contrast (epistemic).**
When the same team asserts `:MassFlowRepresentation RepresentationOf :FlowModel`, they declare `validationMode=postulate` and attach a calibration dataset (Empirical Validation) instead of a **Γₘ** trace. The edge remains publishable, but reviewers record a lower-confidence stance, and B.3.4’s **evidence ageing** policy will decay its trust over time.
  
Result: **one** visible relation for engineers, **two** hidden anchors for assurance.

### 7) Author contract (at a glance)

When you add or import a relation edge:

1. **Pick a Working‑Model relation** (ComponentOf/MemberOf/…); avoid raw `ut:PartOf` unless you are drafting meta‑level axioms.
   
2. **Attach `tv:groundedBy`**:

   * Structural? → **must** be a `Γ_m` trace ID.
   * Epistemic? → `Γ_m` trace *or* evidence object.
3. **Declare `tv:validationMode`** (**postulate** / **inferential** / **axiomatic**).

> **What managers see:** nothing new in the graph picture.
> **What auditors get:** a reliable trail from every published edge back to a principled constructor or an evidence pack.

---

### 8) Compatibility & cross‑references

* **B.3.2 (LOG‑use).** CT2R‑LOG supplies the **places to hang proofs/evidence** that B.3.2 formalizes.
* **B.3.3 (Assurance levels).** `validationMode` + presence/quality of `tv:groundedBy` are the **inputs** to compute `AssuranceLevel (L0–L2)`.
* **B.3.4 (Evidence ageing).** If an edge relies on **postulated evidence**, its confidence **decays** per that pattern until refreshed; **axiomatic** edges from `Γ_m` traces do not age, but their **inputs** (tokens) might.

## 9 · Rule‑set — CT2R‑LOG (conceptual, human‑first)

**Intent (one line).** Make **Working‑Model** relations the canonical interface for authors, while providing a **clean, optional bridge** to formal assurance by way of *aliasing* and *grounding* semantics.

### 9.1 Vocabulary & Roles (what the words mean in this pattern)

* **Working‑Model relation.** A human‑oriented statement an engineer would naturally write, using U.Type relations such as `ut:ComponentOf`, `ut:PortionOf`, `ut:AspectOf`, `ut:MemberOf`. This is the **canonical publication surface** for structure for readers and reviewers in Part B. (Didactic primacy governs this choice.)

* **Assurance Layer.** Three complementary kinds of support an author MAY attach:

  * **Constructive** grounding: a *generative* narrative that reconstructs the relation via the three mereological aggregators (`Γ_m.sum | Γ_m.set | Γ_m.slice`) from **Compose‑CAL**. (No formal notation is required in this pattern—only a reconstructible *story of construction*.)
  * **Logical** grounding: a *reasoned* chain (think KD‑CAL style arguments) that shows why the relation follows from stated premises.
  * **Mapping** grounding: a *type/lexical alignment* that shows the domain label truly denotes the intended U.Type relation (Kind-CAL / Lang‑CHR stance).
    These three kinds of support are *complementary*, not exclusive.

* **Empirical Validation.** How a published relation meets reality (observations, calibration scenarios). It lives beside, not inside, the relation. (See B.3 family.)

* **Grounding vocabulary (`tv:`).**

  * `tv:AliasOf` — declares that a Working‑Model relation is the **canonical projection** of a more general pattern (its “principle of use”).
  * `tv:groundedBy` — points to the **author’s grounding narrative** (Constructive, Logical, or Mapping, as applicable).
    The `tv:` namespace is part of the Core conceptual lexicon; it is **notation‑agnostic** and **tool‑agnostic**.

* **`tv:validationMode ∈ {postulate, inferential, axiomatic}`.** A **declaration by the author** of the *confidence stance* for a relation instance:
  *postulate* — a pragmatic working claim;
  *inferential* — a reasoned consequence;
  *axiomatic* — a constructively grounded identity (mereological extensionality is exhibited). (Modes align with the B.3 cluster’s trust model.) 

> **Authoring note.** This pattern defines *meanings*, not formats. The words above SHALL be used consistently and without reference to any specific notations or execution environments (Guard‑Rails: Notational Independence).

---

### 9.2 Normative rules (MUST/SHALL clauses for thinking‑and‑writing)

**S‑1 (Working-Model first).**
Authors **SHALL** publish structural claims in the **Working‑Model** form (`ut:*Of` relations). This is the canonical interface for human readers and cross‑disciplinary teams. Formal reconstructions are **optional** and live in the Assurance Layer.

**S‑2 (Alias declaration).**
If a Working‑Model relation follows a known general principle, the author **SHOULD** declare `tv:AliasOf <Principle>`, thereby making the intended *use‑pattern* explicit for reviewers and future readers. (This improves comparability without introducing extra formality.)

**S‑3 (Grounding by mode).**
For every relation instance the author **MUST** set `validationMode` and follow the corresponding grounding stance:

* **S‑3.a `postulate`.** The author **MAY** omit `Γ_m` grounding; the relation stands as a pragmatic working claim within a stated scope. The author **SHOULD** supply brief empirical cues (where the claim tends to hold) to ease later validation. (Empirical Validation is tracked in B.3.)

* **S‑3.b `inferential`.** The author **SHALL** outline a *reasoned chain* (plain‑language steps) that makes the relation a consequence of previously admitted statements. No formal calculus is required in this pattern; the outline must be sufficient for a peer to follow. (Think KD‑CAL stance, conceptually.)

* **S‑3.c `axiomatic`.** The author **SHALL** provide a *constructive grounding narrative* that reconstructs the relation as a `Γ_m.sum | Γ_m.set | Γ_m.slice` composition and **SHALL** link it with `tv:groundedBy`. The narrative **MUST** be reconstructible by a competent peer *without introducing new primitives* (parsimony). (Compose‑CAL’s three aggregators are the only constructive moves assumed here.)

* **S-3.d Structural constraint.** For **structural** edges, `tv:groundedBy → Γ_m.*` is **REQUIRED regardless of `validationMode`**; the `postulate` mode **MUST NOT** be used for structural mereology. 

**S-4 (Relation-kind sense-making).**
* For **structural** subtypes of `ut:StructPartOf` (Component/Portion/Aspect), constructive grounding (`tv:groundedBy → Γ_m.*`) is **REQUIRED** in all modes; **`postulate` MUST NOT be used** for structural mereology (see S-3.d).

* For **epistemic/constitutive** links (e.g., representation, usage), constructive grounding is **OPTIONAL** in all stances; authors prefer *inferential* or *postulate* with empirical cues.

**S‑5 (Order and time are not mereology).**
Authors **SHALL NOT** encode execution order, parallelism, or temporal slicing as part‑whole. Such concerns belong to `Γ_method` and `Γ_time` families and **SHOULD** appear as method/time statements adjacent to, not inside, Working‑Model structure. (This prevents conceptual leakage between planes.)

**S‑6 (Unidirectional dependence).**
CT2R‑LOG may *consume* Compose‑CAL and KD‑CAL conceptually; it **SHALL NOT** redefine them. Meaning flows **downward only** (Kernel → Architheory → Context → Instance).

**S‑7 (Register discipline).**
When naming principles in `tv:AliasOf`, authors **SHOULD** use Tech/Plain *twin labels* where available and obey minimal‑generality and rewrite rules (LEX‑BUNDLE), so that aliases are recognisable across context of meaning.

**S‑8 (No tool talk).**
Core prose **MUST NOT** introduce CI/CD terms, file formats, APIs, or machine‑oriented notations in place of concepts. If examples are needed, they **MAY** be plain‑language narratives or domain vignettes. (This pattern is conceptual by contract.)

---

### 9.3 Scope & Non‑Goals (to keep the plane clean)

* **In scope.**
  Canonical publication of relations for humans; alias‑to‑principle clarity; conceptual grounding stories; author‑declared *validationMode*; separation of structure vs order/time.

* **Out of scope.**
  Any machinery that *executes* checks; any binding to specific notations; any process/workflow mechanics; any discussion of file formats. (Those belong to Tooling/Pedagogy artefacts and SHALL NOT be imported by the Conceptual Core.)
  
* **Edge placements.**
  When a claim is chiefly about *naming fit* across Contexts, prefer **Mapping** grounding (Kind-CAL/Lang‑CHR stance). When it is chiefly about *why* it follows, prefer **Logical** grounding. When it is about *what the whole is, from its parts*, prefer **Constructive** grounding. (Authors MAY combine them.)

---

### 9.4 Author’s working moves (micro‑playbook, notation‑free)

**M‑1.** State the relation in **Working‑Model** form (e.g., “Impeller `ComponentOf` Pump”).
**M‑2.** Pick `validationMode`:

* If you’re sketching and exploring → choose **postulate**; add one‑sentence scope.
* If you’re justifying from known statements → choose **inferential**; list the 2–4 steps in plain language.
* If you require extensional identity → choose **axiomatic**; narrate the `Γ_m.*` reconstruction in a short paragraph.

**M‑3.** Add `tv:AliasOf` to the principle you intend readers to recognise (e.g., “Component = sum of parts”).
**M‑4.** Keep *order/time* adjacent, not embedded: if you need “assembled in two parallel lines”, write that as a **method/time** statement next to the structure, not as a part‑of edge.
**M‑5.** Stop when the *reader can follow without guessing*. This is the stopping rule for Quarter 2: clarity before formality. (Didactic primacy.)

### 10) Bias‑Annotation (auditable, human‑first)

The purpose of this section is to make **typical cognitive slips** visible and name the **counter‑moves** an author (or reviewer) should apply **in thought**—not with tools. These biases are generic; the remedies point to earlier FPF guard‑rails and neighbouring patterns.

| Bias (name)                     | Symptom in the model                                                                                                          | Cognitive counter‑move (conceptual only)                                                                                                                                                                          | Where to check                                                       |

| **Canonical inversion**         | Demanding a constructive grounding for **epistemic** claims by default. *(For **structural** claims, Constructive grounding is mandatory; epistemic remains progressive.)*                    | Keep **progressive assurance**: declare `validationMode ∈ {postulate, inferential, axiomatic}`; reserve *axiomatic* with **Constructive** grounding for structural; use **Logical/Mapping**/**Empirical** where appropriate.

### 12) Consequences (benefits, trade‑offs, mitigations)

**Benefits**

* **Cognitive clarity for authors and readers.** By making Working‑Model relations canonical and keeping formal bases as optional groundings, CT2R reduces the barrier to disciplined reasoning while preserving a path to higher assurance when necessary.  This honours the B.3 family's “few characteristics, conservative aggregation” ethos and keeps order/time outside of structure.
* **Progressive assurance without tooling commitments.** The *postulate → inferential → axiomatic* ladder lets teams raise assurance deliberately, matching their context and risk, in line with B.3.3’s maturity logic.
* **Explicit fit management.** Treating edge‑fit (CL) as a first‑class concern prevents silent over‑confidence: weak mappings visibly cap reliability of composed claims.
* **Cleaner separation of concerns.** Distinguishing collections from compositions and keeping sequence/time in Γ\_method / Γ\_time prevents recurrent category errors and preserves Γ‑algebra reviewability.

**Trade‑offs & mitigations**

* **Extra prose discipline.** Declaring `validationMode` and writing a short grounding narrative (when *axiomatic*) adds authoring effort. *Mitigation:* reuse local templates; keep narratives concise and Γ\_m‑oriented by idea rather than notation.
* **Temptation to stay “forever postulate.”** Teams may stop at Working‑Model relations. *Mitigation:* use B.3.3’s subtypes/levels as a **planning aid** to decide where *axiomatic* or *inferential* grounding is worth the cost.
* **Perceived conservatism.** Acknowledging weak fit (CL) may lower effective reliability of otherwise strong parts. *Mitigation:* treat CL as a guide to improvement (reconcile terms, align units, verify interfaces) rather than a punishment.

> **One‑line takeaway for managers.**
> CT2R lets you **talk in natural, domain‑meaningful relations** while preserving a clear, optional path to formal grounding and empirical checking—so confidence can grow deliberately without dragging your model into tooling or syntax.


### 13) · Rationale (informative)

**13.1 Why canonical‑first?**
CT2R‑LOG treats the **human‑readable, task‑appropriate relation** (e.g., `ut:ComponentOf`) as the **canonical publication form** because that is what engineers and managers actually use to reason, decide, and communicate. The formal layers exist to **support** that form—not to replace it. This is consistent with the authoring contract in Part E (pattern template and style guide), which privileges **clarity, purpose and didactics** over premature formalism in the body text. Authors write *for people first*, then point to the kind of assurance they are invoking.

**13.2 Why two `tv:` links—and why concept‑only?**
`tv:AliasOf` and `tv:groundedBy` name **conceptual bridges** between a Working‑Model relation and its assurance. They are *not* mandates for any particular notational scheme; they are **mental handles** that keep authors honest about *what* grounds their claims (constructive, logical, mapping) and *when* that grounding is expected to be present. This honours the **Notational Independence** guard‑rail in Part E: we adopt **concepts and obligations**, not file formats or tool contracts, in the normative text.

**13.3 Why a triad of `validationMode`?**
The triad **{postulate, inferential, axiomatic}** expresses a **scalable formality ladder** compatible with the FPF stance on staged assurance: start with what the team can responsibly claim now, and climb to stricter justification where risk or context demands it. That mirrors the “ladder” patterns in Part E and gives reviewers a shared vocabulary for **how strong** a claim is meant to be—without changing the canonical relation itself.

**13.4 Why keep order/time out of mereology?**
CT2R‑LOG aligns with A.14’s **firewall**: structure (parthood) is distinct from **order** and **temporal coverage**. The former is published as `ut:StructPartOf` sub‑relations; the latter live in `Γ_method` / `Γ_time` and must **not** be smuggled into part‑trees. This separation avoids classic modelling failures (temporal smearing, pseudo‑components for quantities) and keeps reasoning crisp across the Γ‑family.

**13.5 Why point to `Γ_m.sum | set | slice` (Compose‑CAL) for constructive grounding?**
Three constructive moves—**sum, set, slice**—are sufficient to narrative‑rebuild all structural trees while preserving **extensional identity**. When an author selects the *axiomatic* stance, a brief `grounding narrative` can always be told in those terms, without expanding the kernel or inventing bespoke constructors. This satisfies **parsimony (C‑5)** and keeps formal power **outside** the kernel, in a calculus.

**13.6 Why mental obligations rather than process mandates?**
Part E requires that patterns govern **thinking** and **authoring**; enforcement and automation, if any, are external concerns. CT2R‑LOG therefore states obligations as **self‑contained cognitive checks**: declare your mode; tell the constructive story only when you claim *axiomatic* strength; keep order/time in their places. This keeps the core specification **evergreen and tool‑agnostic**, as required.

### 14 · Relations

**Builds on**
• **A.14 Advanced Mereology** — structural catalogue and the firewall that excludes roles/recipes and distinguishes Portion/Phase/Component/Constituent; CT2R‑LOG preserves these distinctions at publication time.
• **A.11 Ontological Parsimony (C‑5)** — constructive grounding lives in a calculus; the kernel remains minimal.
• **B.1 Universal Γ** — shared invariants and the placement of order/time in their respective Γ‑flavours.
• **Part E authoring rules** — canonical pattern template and notational independence, which CT2R‑LOG explicitly follows.

**Coordinates with**
• **Compose-CAL (Γ_m)** — provides the **constructive** shoulder of the Assurance layer for **structural** relations; CT2R-LOG’s `tv:groundedBy` points *conceptually* to traces narratable as **sum/set/slice**.
• **KD‑CAL** — provides the **logical** shoulder (inferential justification) when authors pick `validationMode = inferential`.
• **Kind-CAL / Lang‑CHR** — provide the **mapping** shoulder (type alignment and language hygiene) supporting alias policies without altering Working-Model relations.

**Constrained by**
• **Notational Independence (E.5.2)** — CT2R‑LOG refuses to prescribe formats, keeping all obligations conceptual.

**Specialises / feeds**
• **B.3.1–B.3.4** — supplies the publication discipline (Working-Model relations, declared **relation kind** and **validationMode**; **F** per C.2.3 where relevant) that B.3’s trust calculus expects; interacts with ageing and assurance-level assessments without changing the relations themselves.


**Non‑relations**
**No introduction of order/time** — CT2R‑LOG does **not** define `SerialStepOf` / `ParallelFactorOf` / temporal **phases**; those belong to **Method‑CAL** and **Sys‑CAL (TemporalPart)** respectively.  

### Pattern B.4 — Canonical Evolution Loop \[A]

**Context**

The FPF is built on the **Principle of Open-Ended Evolution (P-10)**. This is not merely a philosophical stance, but a pragmatic recognition that any useful holon—whether a physical system, a scientific theory, or a method—is in a perpetual state of becoming. A static model is a dead model. The framework, therefore, requires a universal, repeatable method that governs how holons adapt and improve over time. This process must bridge the abstract world of `design-time` blueprints with the concrete, messy reality of `run-time` operations, as mandated by the **Temporal Duality principle (Pattern A.4)**.

**Problem**

Without a canonical, shared model for evolution, projects fall into predictable and costly failure modes:

1.  **Design-Reality Divergence (The "Drift"):** The `run-time` artifact (the "as-is") slowly drifts away from its `design-time` specification (the "as-intended"). Over time, the formal models become elegant fictions, assurance cases become irrelevant, and the team loses the ability to reason reliably about their own creation.
2.  **Learning Stagnation (The "Ivory Tower"):** Valuable insights are generated by observing a holon's performance in its context, but there is no formal method to feed this learning back into the design. "Lessons learned" are captured in static documents that are never acted upon.
3.  **Chaotic Change (The "Whack-a-Mole"):** "Improvements" are made in an ad-hoc, reactive manner. Each change is a patch, not a principled refinement. This introduces hidden dependencies and unintended consequences, often making the holon more fragile over time.

**Forces**

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stability vs. Change** | How to evolve a holon continuously while maintaining its core identity and assurance guarantees. |
| **Learning vs. Operating** | How to balance the need for a holon to be stable in its operational context with the need to gather data and learn from its performance. |
| **Top-Down Intent vs. Bottom-Up Reality** | How to reconcile strategic, top-down refinement goals with emergent, bottom-up feedback from operational reality. |

**Solution**

FPF defines the **Canonical Evolution Loop**, a four-phase cycle that serves as the universal engine for all principled, open-ended evolution. This loop is a direct implementation of the **Explore → Shape → Evidence → Operate** state machine (Pattern B.5.1) and is powered by the **Canonical Reasoning Cycle** (Pattern B.5).

The loop creates a closed, auditable circuit between the two temporal scopes. Crucially, transitions between phases are performed by an **external `Transformer`** (Pattern A.12). A holon does not evolve itself; it is evolved by an external agent acting upon it.

*A diagram showing a cycle: Operate (Run-time) → Observe (Run-time to Design-time bridge, performed by a Transformer) → Refine (Design-time) → Deploy (Design-time to Run-time bridge, performed by a Transformer) → Operate.*

**The Four Phases of the Loop:**

| Phase | Core Activity | Role of the External `Transformer` | Key FPF Patterns Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Operate** | The holon exists in its `run-time` context, fulfilling its purpose. | **The `Transformer` observes the holon.** It does not act *on* it, but gathers data about its performance or state. For a `U.System`, this could be a sensor. For a `U.Episteme`, this could be a researcher applying the theory and noting its predictions. | `A.4 Temporal Duality` |
| **2. Observe** | The `Transformer` compares the observed reality with an expected model, identifying an **anomaly** or an **opportunity**. This is the bridge from `run-time` back to `design-time`. | **The `Transformer` generates a new insight.** Based on the observation, the `Transformer` (e.g., the research team, an automated analysis system) formulates a new hypothesis about how to improve the holon. | `B.5.2 Abductive Loop`, `A.10 Evidence Anchoring` |
| **3. Refine** | The `design-time` model of the holon is updated by the `Transformer`. A new hypothesis is shaped (Deduction) and tested against evidence (Induction). | **The `Transformer` modifies the blueprint.** It alters the `design-time` episteme—the specification, the theory, the source code—to incorporate the new insight. | `B.5 Canonical Reasoning Cycle`, `B.3 Trust & Assurance Calculus` |
| **4. Deploy** | The `Transformer` instantiates the refined `design-time` model as a new `run-time` version of the holon. This is the bridge that carries improvements from the blueprint back into the real world. | **The `Transformer` builds and releases the new version.** This could be a compiler building new software, a 3D printer creating a new physical part, or an editor publishing a revised version of a scientific paper. | `A.3 Transformer Constitution`, `A.4 Temporal Duality` |

> **Didactic Note for Managers: The "Learn and Adapt" Engine**
>
> The Canonical Evolution Loop is your organization's formal method for **institutional learning**. It is a structured way to answer the four key questions of continuous improvement:
> 
> 1.  **Operate:** "Is the artifact (system, theory, process) performing its function in its environment?"
> 2.  **Observe:** "What are our monitoring systems and our people (the `Transformers`) telling us? Are there any surprises or problems?"
> 3.  **Refine:** "Based on what we've learned, how can our team (the `Transformer`) design a better version?"
> 4.  **Deploy:** "How does our team (the `Transformer`) roll out the improved version safely and efficiently?"
>
> This loop ensures that your projects don't just *deliver* once, but continuously *adapt* and *improve* based on real-world feedback. It makes the role of the acting agents (`Transformers`) in this evolution explicit and auditable.

**Archetypal Grounding**

The Canonical Evolution Loop is universal. It applies identically to the evolution of physical systems, bodies of knowledge, and operational methods. The following sub-patterns detail its instantiation in each of these domains.

*   **B.4.1 System Instantiation (Field Upgrade Loop):**
    *   **Context:** A fleet of autonomous delivery drones (`U.System`) is in operation.
    *   **Loop Example:**
        1.  **Operate:** The drones perform deliveries.
        2.  **Observe:** A monitoring service (`Transformer`) detects that battery performance degrades faster than expected in cold weather (an anomaly).
        3.  **Refine:** The engineering team (`Transformer`) updates the drone's power management software (`design-time` model) with a new algorithm optimized for cold temperatures.
        4.  **Deploy:** The team (`Transformer`) pushes the new firmware to the entire fleet. The cycle begins again.

*   **B.4.2 Knowledge Instantiation (Theory Refinement Loop):**
    *   **Context:** A scientific theory of protein folding (`U.Episteme`) is being used to predict structures.
    *   **Loop Example:**
        1.  **Operate:** The theory exists and is applied by researchers.
        2.  **Observe:** A research lab (`Transformer`) discovers a new class of proteins whose structure the theory fails to predict (an anomaly). They publish this finding.
        3.  **Refine:** Another research team (`Transformer`) revises the original theory, adding a new term to its equations (`design-time` model) that accounts for the new protein class.
        4.  **Deploy:** The team (`Transformer`) publishes the revised theory in a journal. The scientific community begins to use the new version. **Note.** The *chart* and any CG‑frame readings derived from this episteme MUST cite the updated `MethodDescription` (per A.19.D1 CC‑A19.D1‑3) to keep comparability auditable.

*   **B.4.3 Method Instantiation (Adaptive Workflow Loop):**
    *   **Context:** A software development team uses a specific agile workflow (`U.Method`).
    *   **Loop Example:**
        1.  **Operate:** The team follows the defined workflow for its sprints.
        2.  **Observe:** The scrum master (`Transformer`) notes that the time from code commit to production deployment is consistently exceeding the target SLA (an anomaly).
        3.  **Refine:** The team (`Transformer`) redesigns its CI/CD pipeline (`design-time` model of the method), introducing a new automated testing stage to catch errors earlier.
        4.  **Deploy:** The team (`Transformer`) implements the new pipeline configuration. The next sprint operates under the refined method. **Note.** Method evolution MUST be recorded as `Γ_method` composition over `U.Method` (design‑time) and separated from `U.Work` (run‑time), with DRR ids attached (per A.4/B.1.5).

**Conformance Checklist**

*   **CC-B4.1 (Loop Integrity):** Any evolutionary change to a holon **MUST** be documented as a full traversal of the four-phase loop. Ad-hoc changes that bypass a phase (e.g., deploying a refinement without a documented observation and evidence phase) are a process violation.
*   **CC-B4.2 (Temporal Scope Mandate):** The *Refine* phase **MUST** operate on `design-time` artifacts, while the *Operate* phase involves a `run-time` artifact. The *Observe* and *Deploy* phases are the only permissible bridges between these scopes.
*   **CC-B4.3 (Transformer Mandate):** The *Observe*, *Refine*, and *Deploy* transitions **MUST** be performed by an explicitly identified external `Transformer` (Pattern A.12). A holon cannot observe, refine, or deploy itself.

**Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them**

| Anti-Pattern | Manager's View: What It Looks Like | How FPF Prevents It (Conceptually) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The "Immaculate Conception"** | A new feature or design "just appears" in the specification, with no record of the problem it was meant to solve. | **CC-B4.1** and **CC-B4.3** mandate that every refinement must start with an *Observe* phase, performed by a named `Transformer`. There is no change without a documented observation and an agent who made it. |
| **The "Self-Healing Illusion"** | The model claims "the system automatically improves itself" without specifying the mechanism. | **CC-B4.3** forbids self-evolution. The model must explicitly show an *external* `Transformer` (which could be an automated control loop, but is still modeled as external to the holon being changed) that performs the Observe-Refine-Deploy cycle. |
| **The "Run-time Edit"** | An engineer makes a "quick fix" directly on a live system without updating the official design documents. | **CC-B4.2** enforces that all refinements happen in `design-time`. A "hotfix" is conceptually an emergency, accelerated run through the entire loop: the fix is observed, designed, and then deployed. |

**Consequences**

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Creates a "Learning Architecture":** The loop provides a formal, repeatable structure for continuous improvement and adaptation, making the organization's learning process explicit. | **Process Overhead:** Documenting each phase of the loop can feel bureaucratic for small, rapid changes. *Mitigation:* The conceptual requirement for a DRR (Design Rationale Record) can be lightweight. The key is to capture the *what* and *why* of the change, not to create extensive paperwork. |
| **Ensures Design-Reality Sync:** The loop guarantees that `design-time` specifications and `run-time` realities are continuously reconciled, preventing divergence and maintaining a "living" assurance case. | - |
| **Makes Evolution Auditable:** The entire lifecycle of a holon, including every refinement and the rationale behind it, becomes a traceable, auditable record performed by named `Transformers`. | - |

**Rationale**

This pattern operationalizes the **Open-Ended Evolution Principle (P-10)** by providing its core engine. It is the FPF's formalization of proven iterative cycles like the Deming Cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act) and the OODA Loop (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act), but it enriches them with the strong semantic distinctions of the FPF, such as `design-time` vs. `run-time` and the formal role of the external `Transformer`.

By making the `Transformer`'s role explicit in every phase, the pattern avoids the common conceptual error of treating systems or theories as if they evolve on their own. Evolution is always an *action* performed by an agent on a holon. This rigorous, externalist stance is critical for clear causal reasoning and auditable accountability. By making this loop canonical, FPF ensures that all holons within its ecosystem are not just designed and built, but are designed *to be evolved* in a principled, traceable manner.

### **Pattern B.5 — Canonical Reasoning Cycle [A]** 

**Context**

While preceding patterns define the anatomy of trust (`Assurance Levels` in B.3) and the structure of holons (A.1, A.14), they do not specify the cognitive "engine" that drives the creation and evolution of knowledge within FPF. A framework for thinking must provide more than just a filing system for conclusions; it must offer a repeatable, rigorous method for arriving at them, especially when confronting novel, complex, or ill-defined problems.

**Problem**

Without a formal, shared reasoning cycle, teams and individuals fall into predictable cognitive traps that stall progress and hide risks:

1.  **Analysis Paralysis:** Teams get stuck endlessly debating existing assumptions, running deductions within a closed world of known facts without a mechanism to introduce genuinely new ideas.
2.  **Blind Empiricism:** Teams engage in unstructured, expensive trial-and-error, running tests and gathering data (induction) without a clear, falsifiable hypothesis to guide their efforts.
3.  **Innovation Gap:** In the face of a problem where existing knowledge is insufficient, there is no formal "permission" or process to generate a creative, plausible guess—the essential first step of any breakthrough.

These pathologies lead to wasted resources, circular debates, and a failure to solve the very problems that require first-principles thinking.

**Forces**

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Rigor vs. Innovation** | How can we encourage creative, "out-of-the-box" hypotheses while maintaining formal discipline and verifiability? |
| **Certainty vs. Progress** | How can we act and learn systematically when faced with incomplete information and uncertainty? |
| **Theory vs. Practice** | How do we ensure that abstract models and formal deductions are continuously anchored to real-world evidence and empirical validation? |
| **Systematic Flow** | How do we transform problem-solving from a chaotic, ad-hoc art into a repeatable, auditable, and teachable science? |

**Solution**

FPF establishes the **Abductive–Deductive–Inductive Loop** as its canonical reasoning cycle. This cycle gives formal primacy to **abduction** (hypothesis generation) as the engine of innovation, while using deduction and induction as the rigorous mechanisms for testing and refining those hypotheses.

The loop consists of three distinct, sequential phases:

**1. Abduction (Hypothesis Generation)**

*   **Core Question:** "What is the most plausible new explanation or solution?"
*   **Description:** This is the creative, inventive leap. When faced with an anomaly, a design challenge, or an unanswered question, the first step is to propose a new `U.Episteme`—a new requirement, a new component, a new causal link—that *might* solve the problem. This act is not guaranteed to be correct; it is a conjecture. Within FPF, this new, untested artifact typically begins its life at **`AssuranceLevel:L0 (Unsubstantiated)`**. Abduction is the only phase that introduces genuinely novel ideas into the model. This formalizes the process described in the **Abductive Loop** (Pattern B.5.2).

**2. Deduction (Consequence Derivation)**

*   **Core Question:** "If this hypothesis is true, what logically follows?"
*   **Description:** This is the phase of rigorous analysis. Given the new hypothesis, we use the formal models and calculi of FPF to deduce its logical consequences. What are its testable predictions? Does it create internal contradictions with other parts of the model? How does it propagate through the system? This phase aligns with **Verification Assurance (VA)** and is concerned with raising the artifact's **FormalVerifiabilityScore (FV)**. Deduction turns a plausible idea into a set of precise, falsifiable claims.

**3. Induction (Empirical Evaluation)**

*   **Core Question:** "Do the predicted consequences match reality?"
*   **Description:** This is the phase of testing and learning from evidence. The predictions derived in the deductive phase are compared against real-world data from experiments, simulations, or observations. This phase aligns with **Validation Assurance (LA)** and is the primary mechanism for raising an artifact's **EmpiricalValidabilityScore (EV)** and, consequently, its **Reliability (R)**. A successful test corroborates the hypothesis (raising its `AssuranceLevel`), while a failed test (a refutation) provides critical new information that feeds back into the next abductive cycle.

>
> The Abductive-Deductive-Inductive loop is not an abstract philosophical concept; it is the formal name for the problem-solving cycle that all successful R&D and engineering teams instinctively use.
>
> | Phase | Simple Name | What Your Team Does | FPF's Contribution |
> | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
> | **Abduction** | **Propose** | Brainstorms a new feature, architecture, or fix. | Gives formal permission for this creative step and a place to record the new idea (`L0` artifact). |
| **Deduction** | **Analyze** | Thinks through the implications, runs simulations, checks for conflicts. | Provides the formal models (VA, FV) to make this analysis rigorous and repeatable. |
| **Induction** | **Test** | Builds a prototype, runs A/B tests, gathers user feedback. | Provides the framework (LA, EV, R) to measure the results and build an auditable evidence base. |
>
> By making this cycle explicit, FPF transforms problem-solving from a chaotic art into a repeatable, auditable science. It gives teams a shared map for navigating from an unknown problem to a validated solution.

**Conformance Checklist**

To ensure the reasoning cycle is applied consistently and rigorously, the following criteria are normative:

*   **CC-B5.1 (Abductive Primacy):** Any discipline that introduces a new, non-derivable claim or design element into a working model **MUST** document it as an abductive step. The resulting artifact **SHALL** initially be assigned `AssuranceLevel:L0`.
*   **CC-B5.2 (Deductive Mandate):** An abductively generated hypothesis **SHALL NOT** be subjected to inductive testing (Validation Assurance) until its key logical consequences have been derived and documented through a deductive process.
*   **CC-B5.3 (Inductive Grounding):** A claim **SHALL NOT** be promoted to `AssuranceLevel:L1` or higher on the basis of a successful inductive test unless that test is explicitly linked to a prediction derived in the deductive phase.
*   **CC-B5.4 (Cycle Closure):** The outcome of an inductive test (whether corroboration or refutation) **MUST** be formally recorded as an evidence artifact (Pattern A.10), and this artifact **MUST** be used as an input for the next iteration of the reasoning cycle.
*   **CC-B5.5 (State Machine Alignment):** The Abductive–Deductive–Inductive Loop is the cognitive engine that drives state transitions in the **Explore → Shape → Evidence → Operate** state machine (Pattern B.5.1). Abduction dominates the *Explore* phase; Deduction dominates the *Shape* phase; and Induction is the core of the *Evidence* phase.

**Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them**

| Anti-Pattern | Manager's View: What It Looks Like | How FPF Prevents It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The "Solution in Search of a Problem"** | A team builds a technically impressive feature (deduction/induction) but cannot clearly state what user problem it solves. | **CC-B5.1** forces the process to start with an abductive hypothesis that is explicitly framed as a solution to a stated problem or anomaly. |
| **The "Ready, Fire, Aim" Approach** | A team jumps directly from an idea to expensive prototyping and testing, without a clear model of what they expect to happen. | **CC-B5.2** mandates a deductive analysis phase *before* inductive testing. This ensures that every test is designed to confirm or refute a specific, well-defined prediction. |
| **The "Data Dredging" Exercise** | A team gathers massive amounts of data and looks for correlations, hoping a solution will emerge. | The cycle requires a hypothesis *first*. Data is gathered to test that hypothesis, not in the hope of stumbling upon one. This makes the process more focused and cost-effective. |

**Consequences**

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Encourages Innovation:** By formally sanctioning abduction, the framework creates a safe and structured space for creative problem-solving and the introduction of novel ideas. | **Abduction is not algorithmic:** The framework cannot tell you *how* to generate a good hypothesis. *Mitigation:* It provides the structure to capture and test hypotheses, and can be used in conjunction with creative methodologies (e.g., TRIZ, design thinking) that specialize in hypothesis generation. |
| **Improves Problem-Solving Efficiency:** The cycle provides a clear, repeatable workflow that prevents teams from getting stuck in analysis paralysis or wasting resources on unfocused testing. It ensures that effort is always directed toward falsifying or corroborating a clear claim. | **Requires Iterative Mindset:** The cycle is inherently iterative. Teams must be prepared for hypotheses to be refuted and for the need to restart the cycle. *Mitigation:* FPF's architecture (e.g., cheap state transitions) is designed to make this iteration low-cost. |
| **Creates a Transparent Rationale:** The cycle produces a complete, auditable trail of how a solution was developed: which hypotheses were proposed, what their consequences were, and how they fared against empirical evidence. This "intellectual provenance" is invaluable for future maintenance, audits, and learning. | - |
| **Aligns with Scientific and Engineering Best Practices:** The cycle is a formalization of the scientific method (conjecture and refutation) and modern engineering design cycles (e.g., Deming's PDCA loop). | - |

**Rationale**

FPF is designed to be an "operating system for thought," and this reasoning cycle is its central processing unit. By elevating abduction to a first-class citizen, FPF acknowledges a fundamental truth about complex problem-solving: progress does not come from simply rearranging known facts (deduction) or finding patterns in data (induction). It comes from the creative act of proposing a new way of seeing the world—a new hypothesis. Deduction and induction are the indispensable tools we use to discipline and validate this creativity.

This pattern provides the engine that drives an artifact up the ladder of `AssuranceLevels`. An abductive leap creates an `L0` artifact. Deduction begins the process of providing **Verification Assurance**, building its `FV` score. Induction provides the **Validation Assurance**, building its `EV` and `R` scores. Without this cycle, the assurance framework would be a static scoring system; with it, it becomes a dynamic model of knowledge growth.

**Relations**

*   **Integrates:** `B.5.1 Explore → Shape → Evidence → Operate`, `B.5.2 Abductive Loop`.
*   **Drives:** The progression through `B.3.3 Assurance Subtypes & Levels`.
*   **Enables:** The refinement phase of the `B.4 Canonical Evolution Loop`.
*   **Operationalizes:** The core FPF mission of transforming ideas into reliable, evidence-backed holons.

###  B.5.1 — Explore → Shape → Evidence → Operate \[D]

**Context**

Every successful innovation, from a new piece of software to a scientific theory, follows a predictable evolution (state transitions). It begins as a fuzzy idea, is gradually given a clear structure, is tested against reality, and finally, is put into operational use. Without a shared map of this lifecycle, teams often get stuck: developers might endlessly refine a structure without testing it, while analysts might gather evidence for an idea that has not yet been clearly defined.

**Problem**

How do we provide a simple, universal state machine that guides an artifact's journey from a raw concept to a reliable, operational holon? This pattern defines the four canonical states of this journey, providing a clear roadmap for teams and a stable framework for project management.

**Solution**

FPF defines a four-state development cycle model for any artifact (`U.Episteme` or `U.System`). An artifact transitions from one state to the next as it accumulates rigor and evidence. This state machine is driven by the **Canonical Reasoning Cycle** (Pattern B.5).

**The Four States of an Artifact's Lifecycle:**

| State | Core Activity | Manager's View: What It Means | Driven by Phase of Reasoning Cycle | Typical `AssuranceLevel` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Exploration** | **Generating possibilities.** The focus is on brainstorming, questioning assumptions, and generating multiple, often competing, hypotheses. | "We are in the 'what if' phase. All ideas are on the table. We are looking for a plausible path forward." | **Abduction** (Pattern B.5.2) | `L0` |
| **2. Shaping** | **Defining a single, coherent form.** The most promising hypothesis from the exploration phase is selected and given a rigorous, internally consistent structure. | "We've chosen our direction. Now we are building the blueprint, defining the architecture, and ensuring all the pieces fit together logically."| **Deduction** | `L0` → `L1` (if formalization counts as TA) |
| **3. Evidence** | **Testing against reality.** The shaped artifact is subjected to rigorous empirical or formal tests to validate its claims and measure its performance. | "The blueprint is done. Now we are at the proving ground. Does it actually work? We are running the tests and gathering the data." | **Induction** | `L1` → `L2` |
| **4. Operation** | **Deploying and monitoring in a live environment.** The validated artifact is put into production, where it performs its intended function and is monitored for ongoing reliability. | "It's live. The system is in service, delivering value, and we are monitoring its health and performance." | Continuous Induction (Monitoring) | `L2` (maintained) |

>
> By using these four states, you can instantly communicate to your team and stakeholders exactly where an artifact is in its state transition, what the current focus is, and what needs to happen to move to the next stage.

**Conformance Checklist**

*   **CC-B5.1.1 (State Explicitness):** Every artifact in a project **MUST** be tagged with its current state from the set {Exploration, Shaping, Evidence, Operation}.
*   **CC-B5.1.2 (Sequential Progression):** An artifact **SHALL** progress through the states in sequence. Skipping a state (e.g., moving directly from Exploration to Evidence without Shaping) is a process violation and must be explicitly justified in the artifact's rationale.
*   **CC-B5.1.3 (Reasoning Cycle Alignment):** The transition between states **MUST** be triggered by the completion of the corresponding phase of the Canonical Reasoning Cycle (Pattern B.5). For example, the transition from *Shaping* to *Evidence* requires the completion of the deductive analysis.

**Consequences**

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Clear Project Visibility:** The state machine provides a simple, shared language for tracking the maturity of every artifact in a project. | **Risk of Bureaucracy:** If applied too rigidly, the state machine could feel like a waterfall process. *Mitigation:* The cycle is meant to be rapid and iterative. A single artifact might cycle through all four states within a single sprint. The goal is clarity, not ceremony. |
| **Improved Focus:** Each state has a clear primary activity, which helps teams focus their efforts and avoid common pitfalls like premature optimization or untested designs. | - |
| **Reduces "It's Done" Ambiguity:** The states provide a precise definition of "done" for each phase. An artifact is not "done" with Shaping until its structure is coherent and its consequences are deduced. | - |

**Rationale**

This pattern operationalizes the **Principle of State Explicitness (P-9)**. By giving every artifact a clear, unambiguous state, FPF transforms the often-chaotic process of innovation into a structured, manageable, and auditable development cycle. This state machine provides the "scaffolding" upon which the more detailed cognitive work of the Canonical Reasoning Cycle is performed, ensuring that every idea is systematically guided from a speculative guess to a reliable operational reality.

**Relations**

*   **Is driven by:** `B.5 Canonical Reasoning Cycle`.
*   **Organizes the progression of:** `B.3.3 Assurance Subtypes & Levels`.
*   **Provides the states for:** `B.4 Canonical Evolution Loop`.

### B.5.2 — Abductive Loop \[A]

**Context**

The Canonical Reasoning Cycle (Pattern B.5) begins with abduction—the act of generating a new hypothesis. While deduction and induction have well-understood formalisms, abduction is often treated as a mysterious "black box" of creativity, a moment of insight that cannot be managed or systematized. This view is both impractical and incorrect. In engineering, research, and strategy, the ability to generate high-quality, plausible hypotheses is the single most critical driver of innovation.

**Problem**

Without a formal method for abduction, teams are left to rely on unstructured brainstorming or individual genius. This leads to several failure modes:

1.  **Innovation Deadlock:** When faced with a problem that cannot be solved with existing knowledge, the team has no formal next step. They are stuck, waiting for a "eureka" moment that may never come.
2.  **Untraceable Origins:** When a new idea does emerge, its origins are often unrecorded. The context, the discarded alternatives, and the initial rationale are lost, making it impossible to audit or learn from the decision later.
3.  **Low-Quality Hypotheses:** Without a guiding structure, brainstorming can produce a wide range of ideas, but many may be untestable, irrelevant, or based on flawed assumptions.

**Forces**

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Creativity vs. Discipline** | How can we encourage bold, imaginative leaps while ensuring they are grounded, plausible, and lead to testable outcomes? |
| **Speed vs. Rigor** | How can we generate new ideas quickly without sacrificing the analytical rigor needed to vet them? |
| **Openness vs. Focus** | How can we explore a wide range of possibilities without getting lost in endless, unproductive speculation? |

**Solution**

FPF operationalizes abduction not as a single moment of insight, but as a structured, iterative **Abductive Loop**. This loop provides a repeatable method for generating and refining high-quality hypotheses.

**1. The Nature of Abduction in FPF**

In FPF, abduction is defined as **inference to the most plausible explanation or solution**. It is not a random guess. It is a reasoned, albeit non-deductive, process of proposing a new `U.Episteme` that, if true, would best explain a surprising observation or solve a pressing problem.

**2. The Abductive Loop: A Four-Step Micro-Cycle**

The loop provides a scaffold for this inference process:

| Step | Core Activity | Manager's View: What Your Team is Doing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Frame the Anomaly** | **Isolate the surprise.** The team clearly articulates the specific observation, conflict, or goal that cannot be explained or achieved with the current model. | "Let's be crystal clear about the one specific thing we don't understand or can't solve right now." |
| **2. Generate Candidate Hypotheses** | **Brainstorm explanations.** The team generates a set of candidate hypotheses, each proposing a new entity, relation, or rule that could account for the anomaly. | "What are all the possible reasons for this? Let's get them all on the table, from the obvious to the radical." |
| **3. Apply Plausibility Filters** | **Rank the candidates.** The team assesses each hypothesis against a set of plausibility criteria (e.g., simplicity, consistency with known principles, explanatory power). | "Which of these ideas are actually worth pursuing? Which are too complex, contradict known facts, or don't really solve the problem?" |
| **4. Select & Formalize the Prime Hypothesis** | **Choose the best bet.** The most plausible hypothesis is selected and formally documented as a new `U.Episteme` artifact with `AssuranceLevel:L0`. | "We've got our lead. Let's write it down as a formal, testable claim and move it to the next stage of the reasoning cycle." |

This loop can be cycled through rapidly. An initial "prime hypothesis" might be quickly refined or replaced as the team deepens its understanding by applying the plausibility filters.

> **Didactic Note for Managers: De-Mystifying Creativity**
>
> The Abductive Loop is your tool for managing innovation. It transforms "waiting for a brilliant idea" into a proactive, repeatable method.
>
> *   **It's not about forcing creativity; it's about creating the conditions for it.** By clearly *framing the anomaly*, you give your team a focused target for their creative efforts.
> *   **It values quantity *and* quality.** The *generation* step encourages a wide net of ideas. The *plausibility filtering* step ensures that only the most promising of those ideas consume valuable engineering and testing resources.
> *   **It's a funnel, not a lightbulb.** The loop is a process of systematic refinement. It takes a cloud of possibilities and funnels them down to a single, high-quality, testable conjecture. This makes innovation a manageable, predictable part of your project plan, not a random stroke of luck.

**Conformance Checklist**

*   **CC-B5.2.1 (Anomaly Framing Mandate):** Any abductive process **MUST** begin with a documented "anomaly statement" that clearly defines the problem, observation, or goal that the current model cannot address.
*   **CC-B5.2.2 (Plausibility Filter Mandate):** The selection of a prime hypothesis **MUST** be justified by documenting its evaluation against at least two plausibility filters. Common filters include:
    *   **Parsimony (Occam's Razor):** Does the hypothesis introduce the minimum necessary new complexity?
    *   **Explanatory Power:** How much of the anomaly does the hypothesis explain?
    *   **Consistency:** Is the hypothesis consistent with well-established, high-reliability principles (Pillars) from other parts of the model?
    *   **Falsifiability:** Does the hypothesis generate clear, testable predictions?
*   **CC-B5.2.3 (L0 Artifact Mandate):** The selected prime hypothesis **MUST** be instantiated as a new `U.Episteme` artifact with its `AssuranceLevel` explicitly set to `L0 (Unsubstantiated)`.
*   **CC-B5.2.4 (Traceability Mandate):** The `L0` artifact **MUST** contain a rationale that links it back to the anomaly statement and briefly summarizes the plausibility filtering that led to its selection.

**Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them**

| Anti-Pattern | Manager's View: What It Looks Like | How FPF Prevents It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The "Pet Idea" Problem** | An influential team member pushes their favorite solution without considering alternatives. The team spends weeks pursuing a flawed idea because no one challenged it. | **CC-B5.2.2** forces the team to generate and filter *multiple* candidates. The "pet idea" must compete on its merits against other plausible hypotheses. |
| **The "Untestable Grand Theory"** | A team proposes a sweeping, philosophical explanation that sounds impressive but generates no concrete, testable predictions. | The **Falsifiability** plausibility filter (part of CC-B5.2.2) requires that any selected hypothesis must lead to clear predictions. If it doesn't, it's rejected as a poor candidate. |
| **Solving a Symptom, Not the Cause** | The team proposes a quick fix that addresses the immediate pain point but fails to resolve the underlying anomaly. The problem keeps recurring. | **CC-B5.2.1** forces a clear articulation of the *anomaly* itself. The **Explanatory Power** filter then helps the team evaluate whether a proposed solution actually resolves the root cause. |

**Consequences**

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Structured Innovation:** The loop provides a repeatable, auditable method for generating high-quality hypotheses, making innovation a manageable engineering activity rather than a random event. | **Cognitive Effort:** Applying the plausibility filters requires deliberate, critical thinking. *Mitigation:* The method is designed to be lightweight and rapid. A team can cycle through the loop multiple times in a single workshop session. |
| **Improved Decision Quality:** By forcing the consideration of multiple alternatives and the application of explicit filters, the process significantly increases the quality and robustness of the selected hypothesis. | - |
| **Enhanced Traceability and Learning:** The process creates a clear record of the "why" behind a design choice—which problem was being solved, what alternatives were considered, and why the chosen path was selected. This is invaluable for future learning and onboarding. | - |
| **Resource Optimization:** The loop acts as a "quality gate" for ideas. It ensures that only the most plausible and promising hypotheses proceed to the more resource-intensive deductive and inductive phases, saving significant time and money. | - |

**Rationale**

The Abductive Loop is the formal heart of the **Exploration** state (Pattern B.5.1). It operationalizes the principle that all rigorous inquiry begins with a well-formed question and a plausible, falsifiable answer. While FPF cannot automate creativity, it can and must provide a disciplined scaffold to guide it. This loop provides that scaffold.

It directly implements the **Primacy of Abduction** (from ADR-005) by placing hypothesis generation at the very start of the reasoning process. It is the engine that creates the initial `L0` artifacts that are the raw material for the rest of the FPF assurance lifecycle. By making this often-implicit process explicit, auditable, and repeatable, FPF provides a powerful tool for navigating the uncertainty and complexity inherent in any frontier-pushing project.

**Relations**

*   **Is the first step of:** `B.5 Canonical Reasoning Cycle`.
*   **Takes place during:** `B.5.1 Exploration` state.
*   **Produces:** `AssuranceLevel:L0` artifacts, which become the input for deductive analysis and subsequent progression through `B.3.3 Assurance Subtypes & Levels`.
*   **Is informed by:** The **Role-Projection Bridge** (Pattern B.5.3), which can provide a rich vocabulary of domain-specific concepts to use in generating hypotheses.

# B.5.2.1 — Creative Abduction with NQD (binding) \[A]

**Status.** Normative **binding** to **B.5.2 Abductive Loop** that delegates candidate generation to **Γ_nqd.generate** (**C.18 NQD-CAL**) and exploration/exploitation policy to **E/E-LOG (C.19)**; the kernel remains unchanged.

**Non‑duplication & parsimony.** “Introduces **no new kernel primitives**; reuses the CHR kit (**A.17/A.18**) to define measurable **Characteristics**. This pattern does not introduce new eligibility conditions. Application is permitted only when USM coverage holds for the target slice and the performer’s RSG state is enactable (eligibility), without prescribing any team workflow. Per **A.11 Ontological Parsimony**, only a context‑local CHR import and a **Method** are added; **no changes to Γ/LOG**. All generation is performed via **Γ_nqd.* (C.18)** and all exploration/exploitation control via **E/E-LOG (C.19)**. 
**Terminology discipline.** Use **NQD** consistently (Novelty–Quality–Diversity). Treat **S**/**I** as *secondary* metrics unless explicitly promoted by policy (see §3, §5).

**Context**
* **Conceptual binding:** **B.5.2 Abductive Loop** (this pattern specifies the *how* for Steps 2–3).
* **Architheory anchor:** a domain‑neutral **Creativity‑CHR** (C‑cluster) that declares the **Characteristics** used here (see §2). (No change to Γ/LOG.) This binding also references **C.18 NQD-CAL** (operators Γ_nqd.*) and **C.19 E/E-LOG** (EmitterPolicy).
* **Manager’s mental model (informative):** “We add measurable characteristics for *newness*, *spread*, and *fit*, then use a generator that explores widely and returns a **Pareto set** (not a single winner) of non‑dominated options.”
* **Operational loops:** compatible with **B.4 Canonical Evolution Loop** (ideas generated here flow into Run→Observe→Refine→Deploy) and with **B.5 Canonical Reasoning Cycle** (ADI), preserving abductive primacy. 
* **Agency note.** Decisions are taken by a **system in role**. **Contexts publish** measurement spaces and admissible policies as **semantic frames**; they do **not** enact choices.

## 1 · Intent & Problem

**Intent.** Turn Step 2 (*generate*) and Step 3 (*filter*) of the Abductive Loop from ad‑hoc brainstorming into a **disciplined, instrumented exploration** that can (i) *produce many* distinct, plausible hypotheses and (ii) *surface the few worth pursuing*—*without* bloating the kernel or forcing a specific creative method.

**Problem.** Unstructured ideation routinely fails on two fronts: it either produces *too little variety* (pet ideas win by seniority) or *too little plausibility* (grand theories with no testable predictions). **B.5.2** names these failure modes; this plug‑in adds a minimal, measurable counter‑mechanism aligned to FPF’s assurance lanes and state machine.

## 2 · The **Creativity‑CHR** (references only; no re‑definitions here)

This binding **references** the context‑local **Creativity‑CHR** (see **C.17**) and **does not** restate measurement templates. The primary coordinates are:
• **`Novelty@context`** (C.17 §5.1), • **`ΔDiversity_P`** (marginal; C.17 §5.5), and • **`Q` components** (per A.18).  
**`Surprise`** and **`Illumination`** are **secondary**: Illumination is a **gauge over Diversity_P**; both act as **tie‑breakers** unless explicitly promoted by policy (C.19).  
**`Use‑Value`** (*alias:* `ValueGain`) is **informative for decision lenses** (Decsn‑CAL) and **MUST NOT** enter NQD dominance by default (see C.17 §5.2).

All listed **Characteristics** are **context‑local** with explicit units/ranges and **polarity↑**. They are *measurements*, not eligibility conditions; eligibility conditions are supplied by **USM/RSG**. (Complies with **A.18** measurement discipline; does not overload assurance semantics.)

> **Lexical discipline.** The items above are **Characteristics** in the sense of **A.17/A.18**; avoid reserved names such as “validity” or “operation.”
> **Normalization note.** If a **QualityVector** has heterogeneous units, Contexts SHALL normalize or nondimensionalize each component before Pareto analysis (see CC‑B.5.2.1‑7).
> **D vs I (normative).** **D = ΔDiversity_P** (marginal gain) and is eligible for the primary dominance test. **I** is _portfolio illumination_ (report/visual); it **SHALL NOT** be part of the primary dominance test and is usable **only** as an explicit tie-break per policy.

## 3 · Solution — **Binding to Γ_nqd.generate (C.18)**

**Method name (Plain/Unified Tech).** *NQD‑Generate* — a **U.Method** that, given (i) a **HypothesisSpace** and (ii) a **DescriptorSpace** with a **CoverageGrid**, returns a *finite*, **non‑dominated** set of candidate hypotheses that maximize **Quality** (per‑component) while maintaining **Diversity** and encouraging **Novelty**.

**Minimal signature.**

* **Inputs (declared in MethodDescription):**
 `HypothesisSpace`, `DescriptorSpace`, `Seeds?`, `Budget (time/compute)`, `EmitterPolicy` (**E/E-LOG policy id**), `QualityMeasures (Q components)`, `NoveltyMetric`, `CoverageGrid/Granularity`, `CellCapacity K? (default=1)`, `EpsilonDominance ε? (default=0)`, `TieBreakPolicy? (S/I)`, `DedupThreshold?`, `Policy(TimeWindow)`, `DeterminismSeed?`
 
* **Outputs:**
  CandidateSet = {h_i: (desc_i, Q_i, N_i, D_i:=ΔDiversity_P(h_i | Pool), S_i, I_i, UseValue_i?), genealogy_i?, provenance_i (including **metricsEdition** and **policyId** from E/E-LOG)} where `Q_i` is a vector and `provenance_i` captures generator settings and evaluation sources. If Use‑Value is present, include the objective id / acceptanceSpec, counterfactual method (if predicted), and model edition per C.17. Note: S and I are tie-breakers only unless promoted by explicit Context policy; Use-Value is informative for decision lenses and SHALL NOT enter the dominance set.

**Strategy (notation‑neutral).**

1. **Seeding.** Initialize with seeds (known solutions, random draws, or prior L0 artifacts).
2. **Iterated illumination.** Propose variations, evaluate **Q** (per‑component); maintain up to **K** elites per cell (or descriptor bucket); compute **N/D/S/I** on the fly; deduplicate by `DedupThreshold` in **DescriptorSpace**.
3. **Budget‑bounded loop.** Iterate until budget or coverage‑convergence; return the **(ε‑)Pareto front** over `{Q₁…Q_k, D, N, ΔDiversity_P}` (do **not** collapse to a single scalar). Illumination is excluded from the dominance set by default; Surprise and Illumination act only as tie-breakers unless a Context policy explicitly promotes them. **Use-Value** may appear as a **side note** for decision discussions **but MUST NOT be mixed into NQD dominance set**.   
4. **Traceability.** Emit a **Design Rationale Record (DRR)**: grids/metrics versions, seed(s), policy and `TimeWindow`, which cells were filled, why items were dominated (list **Characteristics**), and how the final set was produced (including `ε`, `K`, and dedup). (Lightweight DRR is permitted per B.4 guidance.)
5. **Algorithmic freedom (informative).** Implementations MAY use MAP‑Elites/illumination, novelty search with local competition, Bayesian/surrogate‑assisted search, or deterministic enumerations; ε‑dominance or knee‑point thinning MAY be used *after* recording the full front in provenance.

> **No kernel growth.** This is a *Method* (C.4 Method‑CAL) plus a CHR import; **no new Γ‑operator** is added (per **A.11**).

## 4 · Implementation & Binding into **B.5.2** (two injection points)

**Step 2 — Generate candidates.** 
**Precondition (USM+RSG).** Generation is permitted only when the **Claim/Work Scope** covers the TargetSlice (USM) **and** the performer’s **RoleAssignment** is in an **enactable RSG state** (Green-Gate law). 

When the plug‑in is imported, replace or *supplement* freeform brainstorming with **NQD‑Generate**; the output is a *pool* of L0 hypotheses annotated by `{N, D, Q, S, I, V?}` **plus provenance/DRR refs**. The abductive step remains *abduction* (a conjecture), now instrumented and diverse by construction.

**Step 3 — Plausibility filters.** Apply B.5.2’s plausibility criteria, now with explicit hooks:

* **Falsifiability** → filter out ideas with no testable predictions in the **Shaping/Evidence** states (B.5 alignment).
* **Explanatory power** → prioritize candidates whose *Q‑improvements* (and attached rationales) align with the framed anomaly.

The *selected* “prime hypothesis” proceeds exactly as in B.5.2: formalize it as a new `U.Episteme` at **L0**, then move to Deduction/Induction.

Primary dominance test: compute the (ε-)Pareto front over {Q components, N, ΔDiversity_P}. By default S (Surprise), I (Illumination) are excluded from dominance and may only act as tie-breakers by policy; Use-Value remains non-dominant.

**Defaults (if policy is unspecified)**  
> **Dominance:** `{Q components, Novelty@context, ΔDiversity_P}`, with `ConstraintFit=pass` as **eligibility gate**.  
> **Tie‑breakers:** `Surprise`, `Illumination (gauge over Diversity_P)` only.  
> **Archive:** `K=1`, `ε=0`, deduplication in `DescriptorSpace`.  
> **Policy:** UCB‑class with moderate temperature; `explore_share ≈ 0.3–0.5`.  
> **Provenance (minimum):** record `DescriptorMapRef`, `metricsEdition`, `EmitterPolicyRef`, `TimeWindow`, `Seeds`.

“**Scope‑of‑claim annotation (descriptive).** Record the **BoundedContext** and **TimeWindow** that delimit where each **N/Q/D** measurement is intended to hold; this is for reasoning traceability only (no operational gates).”

Note — Status `Surprise` (scope and default role):
By default in B.5.2.1, `Surprise` functions solely as a secondary tie‑break among candidates that are otherwise Pareto‑equivalent on the Context’s primary characteristics. A Context policy MAY elevate `Surprise` into the dominance set, allowing it to enter the CreativitySpace dominance alongside the primary characteristics.  If no Context policy is specified, the default tie‑break role applies.

## 5 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑B.5.2.1‑1 (CHR discipline).** If a Context uses this plug‑in, it **SHALL** declare the Creativity‑CHR **Characteristics** with **A.18**‑style templates (type, unit/range, polarity). No new kernel terms are introduced.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑2 (Instrumented generation).** Step 2 of **B.5.2** **SHALL** either (a) invoke *NQD‑Generate* or (b) justify a Context‑specific generator of equivalent effect (diversity + quality + novelty with measurable **Characteristics**).
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑3 (Diversity coupling).** When this plug‑in is used, **D MUST be ΔDiversity_P** computed against the current candidate Pool using the **C.17** definition of **Diversity_P** under the same Context, DescriptorSpace, kernel, and TimeWindow.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑Eligibility**: Eligibility requires **(i)** `ConstraintFit = pass` for the candidate (Norm‑CAL must‑set), **then (ii)** **USM** coverage for the TargetSlice and **(iii)** an enactable **RSG** state for the performer; only then may calls to `Γ_nqd.*` occur.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑4 (Non‑dominated shortlist).** The *CandidateSet* **MUST** include the **Pareto front** over `{Q₁…Q_k, N, D}`; any pruned candidate **MUST** carry a DRR note (“dominated by … on {Characteristics}”).
**CC‑B5.2.1‑5 (Abductive primacy preserved).** The plug‑in **MUST NOT** bypass the ADI ordering mandated by **B.5**: induction may not start before deduction; abductive L0 creation remains the start.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑6 (Normalization for Pareto).** When **Q** has multiple components with different units/scales, Contexts **SHALL** normalize or use declared utility‑free monotone transforms before dominance tests.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑7 (Use‑Value separation). ** If Use‑Value (C.17 §5.2) is recorded, it SHALL remain outside Assurance scores; it MAY inform decision lenses (Decsn‑CAL). Do not alter **R/G** semantics based on Use‑Value. (see **C.17 §5.2** for `Use-Value / ValueGain` definition)
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑8 (Provenance).** Each `h_i` in the *CandidateSet* **MUST** reference its `provenance_i` sufficient to reproduce scores given the same `Policy(TimeWindow)`, score/metric versions, and `DeterminismSeed?`.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑9 (Secondary metrics).** **I (illumination) and S (surprise)** SHALL be used only for tie‑breaking/reporting unless explicitly promoted by policy; the primary dominance test is over {Q components, Novelty@context, ΔDiversity_P}.
**CC‑B.5.2.1‑10 (Cell capacity & ε).** If `K>1` or `ε>0` are used, the values MUST be declared and recorded in provenance; any thinning AFTER recording the front SHALL be documented in the DRR.
**CC-B.5.2.1-11 (Dominance set).** By default the dominance set SHALL be {Q components, N, ΔDiversity_P}. Any deviation (e.g., adding S) MUST be named by policy and recorded in provenance.

## 6 · Cognitive Load & Kernel Growth Budget

**For engineers/managers (user cognitive load).**

* *Added steps:* selecting descriptor **Characteristics** & granularity; reading a Pareto table (**non‑statisticians tip:** scan the “front” row; ignore dominated rows).
* *Mitigations:* provide a one‑screen “NQD Cards” template analogous to RSG cards; default grids and metrics per Context. (Keep ≤ 7 visible **Characteristics**—mirrors RSG human‑scale guidance.)
* *Reader quickstart (engineer‑manager):* (1) Pick 2–3 **Q** characteristics aligned to the anomaly + a simple **DescriptorSpace** (2–4 dimensions). (2) Accept defaults for `NoveltyMetric`, grid granularity, and `K=1`. (3) Run **NQD‑Generate** to a fixed budget; read the *front row* first. (4) Apply Step 3 filters; log decisions in the DRR.

**For the framework (kernel growth).**

* *Zero* new primitives; only a CHR import and a **Method**. Passes **A.11** minimal‑sufficiency. 

## 7 · Placement in the Reasoning Cycle (ADI)

This plug‑in **only structures hypothesis exploration** (Abduction) and does not define or imply any **operational** gates. It respects ADI ordering (Abduct → Deduct → Induct) and leaves deployment/readiness concerns to patterns outside this spec.

## 8 · Context‑Level KPIs (optional, informative)

Contexts *may* monitor these—*not* as gates, but to improve practice:

1. **Generativity (Gv).** Fraction of abductive cycles whose selected candidate reaches **L1/L2** within policy windows (time‑to‑L1; time‑to‑evidence). (Maps onto state transitions driven by **B.5**.)
2. **Frontier‑Hit Rate (FHR).** % of cycles where the chosen candidate lies on the **Pareto front** of `{Q, N, D}` at selection time.
3. Coverage Gain (ΔI, report). Change in the *illumination summary* (coverage map/%filled cells) per cycle (how much of the descriptor space is now “lit”).
4. **Exploration Cost Ratio (ECR).** Compute/time spent in NQD‑Generate divided by downstream Shape/Evidence cost saved (tracks whether the plug‑in pays for itself).
5. **Refutation Learning Yield (RLY).** Among *refuted* candidates, % that added new coverage or raised SurpriseScore—turning “failures” into map‑building.

---

## 9 · Worked micro‑example (abbreviated)

**Framing = Step 1 in B.5.2**
**Context:** A Context using FPF to evolve FPF itself (meta‑improvement). *Anomaly:* “Users perceive FPF as compliance‑heavy; we need first‑principles creativity surfaced.” 

**Step 2 (NQD‑Generate).**

* **DescriptorSpace:** {*creative‑characteristic count*, *explicit novelty metric present?*, *QD operator present?*, *didactic cards present?*}. *(Illustrative; Contexts SHALL define their own descriptors per §2.)*
* **Q‑measures:** {*editor effort↓*, *time‑to‑L1↓*, *reader clarity↑*}.
* **Output Pareto set (sketch):**

  * `h₁ = “Add Creativity‑CHR + NQD plug‑in (this pattern)”` — high *D*, high *N*, medium *Q*.
  * `h₂ = “Rename governance terms to arts vocabulary”` — low *N*, low *D*, medium *Q*.
  * `h₃ = “Add live ideation sandbox (ops tooling)”` — medium *N*, medium *D*, high *Q*.

**Step 3 (Filters).**

* **Falsifiability:** `h₂` weak—no testable prediction → drop.
* **Scope (USM):** `h₁` scoped to Part B; `TimeWindow = edition 2025‑Q4` → *covers TargetSlice*. `h₃` crosses Contexts (tooling) → requires Bridge; the overhead is accounted for in **R** (not **F/G**). *(This plug‑in does not create or alter Bridges.)*
* **Select prime:** `h₁` → formalize as L0 episteme (this pattern), move to *Shaping* (define checklist), then *Evidence* (track KPIs).

## 10 · Trade‑offs & mitigations

* **Cognitive effort.** Interpreting Pareto sets and coverage maps adds thinking overhead. *Mitigation:* standard “NQD Card” + default grids; keep **Characteristics** small in number (≤ 7). *Manager shortcut:* pick 2–3 **Q** characteristics that reflect the anomaly, then run with defaults.
* **Locality.** Novelty/diversity are **context‑local**; Cross‑context reuse requires **re‑measurement or an explicit mapping**. This pattern **does not define** Cross‑context operational controls.
* **Not a magic idea machine.** Abduction remains human/agentic; the plug‑in *structures* search, it does not automate insight. B.5’s abductive primacy stands.
* **Metric gaming & collinearity.** Avoid making **N** and **S** redundant by policy; when strong collinearity is detected, freeze one as informative only and record rationale in the DRR.

## 11 · Related Patterns

* **Extends:** **B.5.2 Abductive Loop** (Step 2/3 operationalization). 
* **Driven by / feeds:** **B.5 Canonical Reasoning Cycle** (Abduction→Deduction→Induction), **B.4 Evolution Loop** (Observe/Refine). 
* **Uses:** **A.17/A.18** for characteristic discipline and **B.5 ADI ordering**. **May** refer to Context‑specific MAP‑Elites/novelty‑search implementations in the MethodDescription. **No operational gating is in scope here.** C.17 (Use‑Value / ValueGain, normative definition).
* **Respects:** **A.11** (no kernel growth beyond CHR template import + Method).
  

### B.5.3 — Role-Projection Bridge \[A]

**Context**

The FPF is built upon a small set of universal, domain-agnostic concepts (`U.Types`) like `U.System`, `U.Objective`, and `U.State`. This universality is the source of its power, allowing it to be applied to any domain, from thermodynamics to software engineering. However, practitioners in these domains do not speak in terms of `U.Types`; they use their own rich, specialized vocabularies. A thermodynamicist talks about a "Thermodynamic System" and its "Macrostate," not a `U.System` and its `U.State`.

**Problem**

How can FPF bridge this gap between its universal core and the specific language of a domain without either polluting the kernel with domain-specific terms or forcing experts to abandon their familiar vocabulary? A simple alias mechanism (e.g., a dictionary mapping `U.System` to "Thermodynamic System") is insufficient because:

1.  **It's brittle:** It assumes a one-to-one mapping, which often breaks down. A single domain concept can play multiple universal roles in different contexts.
2.  **It's semantically poor:** It only captures naming, not the rich constraints and relationships that a domain-specific concept entails. We can't express that a "Thermodynamic System" is a *special kind* of `U.System` with specific properties related to temperature and pressure.
3.  **It's not integrated:** The mappings live outside the formal model, making them difficult to govern, version, and use in automated reasoning.

**Forces**

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Universality vs. Specificity** | How to maintain a lean, universal kernel while accommodating the rich, specific terminologies of countless domains. |
| **Flexibility vs. Rigor** | How to allow a single entity to be viewed through multiple lenses (e.g., as a physical system and an economic asset) without creating ambiguity. |
| **Integration vs. Isolation** | How to incorporate domain knowledge into the formal model without hard-coding it into the FPF kernel, thereby preserving the Open-Ended Kernel principle (P-4). |

**Solution**

FPF solves this with the **Role-Projection Pattern**, a mechanism that creates a robust, semantically rich **Concept-Bridge** between the universal kernel and domain-specific vocabularies. This pattern is built on three core components:

**1. The `Role` Concept**

*   **Description:** FPF introduces a new universal type, `U.Role`. A `Role` is not a concrete thing but an **abstract, context-dependent role** that an entity can play. It represents the domain-specific *interpretation* of a universal concept.
*   **Example:** "Thermodynamic System" is not modeled as a new subtype of `U.System`. Instead, it is modeled as a `Role` that a `U.System` can *play* when it is being analyzed from a thermodynamic perspective.

**2. The `refinesType` Relation**

*   **Description:** Every `Role` **MUST** declare which universal `U.Type` it refines or specializes. This is done via the `refinesType` relation.
*   **Example:** The `ThermodynamicSystemRole` would have the relation `refinesType: U.System`. This creates a formal, unbreakable link to the kernel. It guarantees that any entity playing this role still inherits all the fundamental properties and invariants of a `U.System`. This is a many-to-one relationship: many different roles (e.g., `EconomicSystemRole`, `BiologicalSystemRole`) can all refine the same `U.System` type.

**3. The `plays_role_of` Relation**

*   **Description:** This relation connects a **concrete entity** in a model to a `Role`. It is the assertion that "this specific thing is currently playing that specific role."
*   **Example:** In a model of a steam engine, we would assert that our specific engine instance `plays_role_of: ThermodynamicSystemRole`. This assertion signals to all tools and reviewers that this engine should be interpreted as a `U.System` and that the rules and constraints associated with the `ThermodynamicSystemRole` now apply to it.

> **Didactic Note for Managers: From "Alias" to "Job Description"**
>
> The Role-Projection pattern is the difference between giving someone an alias and giving them a job description.
>
> *   **An Alias (the old way):** Simply says "Bob is also known as The Manager." It's just a name swap.
> *   **A Role (the FPF way):** Says "Bob `plays_role_of` Manager." This is much richer. It implies that Bob has specific responsibilities, authorities, and performance expectations that come with the "Manager" role. He might also play other roles, like "Mentor" or "Team Lead."
>
> Similarly, when we say a component `plays_role_of` "Sensor," we are not just renaming it. We are activating a rich set of expectations and rules that come with being a sensor (e.g., it must have an output port, it must have a defined accuracy, etc.). This makes our models smarter, safer, and more precise.

**Archetypal Grounding**

To illustrate the pattern in action, let's consider how we would bridge the domain of **classical thermodynamics** to the FPF kernel.

1.  **Define the Roles:** A domain expert creates a set of `Role`s, each refining a core `U.Type`:
    *   A `U.Role` named `ThermodynamicSystemRole` with `refinesType: U.System`. It might have a description: "A region of the universe under study, separated by a boundary."
    *   A `U.Role` named `MacrostateRole` with `refinesType: U.State`. Its description could specify that it is defined by variables (P, V, T, N).
    *   A `U.Role` named `ControlVolumeRole` with `refinesType: U.Boundary`.
    *   A `U.Role` named `FreeEnergyObjectiveRole` with `refinesType: U.Objective`.

2.  **Apply the Roles in a Model:** An engineer modeling a heat engine would then use these roles:
    *   They create an instance of `U.System` representing the engine and assert: `HeatEngine_Instance plays_role_of: ThermodynamicSystemRole`.
    *   They model the engine's state and assert: `EngineState_Instance plays_role_of: MacrostateRole`.
    *   They define the system's goal and assert: `EngineObjective_Instance plays_role_of: FreeEnergyObjectiveRole`.

**What this achieves:**

*   The model is now **semantically rich**. Tools can now understand that `HeatEngine_Instance` is not just any system, but one that should be analyzed using the laws of thermodynamics.
*   The model is **verifiable**. A tool could now check if an entity playing the `MacrostateRole` actually has attributes for Pressure and Temperature, enforcing domain-specific consistency.
*   The model remains **universally compatible**. Because `ThermodynamicSystemRole` refines `U.System`, the heat engine can still be reasoned about as a generic system in a wider context (e.g., in a model of the entire power plant).

**Conformance Checklist**

*   **CC-B5.3.1 (Role Grounding Mandate):** Every `U.Role` **MUST** be linked to exactly one universal `U.Type` via the `refinesType` relation. Orphaned roles are forbidden.
*   **CC-B5.3.2 (Explicit Role Assertion):** A domain-specific concept **SHALL NOT** be treated as a subtype of a `U.Type` directly. Its relationship **MUST** be expressed using the `plays_role_of` relation to a `U.Role`.
*   **CC-B5.3.3 (Multi-Role Flexibility):** A single entity **MAY** `play_role_of` multiple `Role`s simultaneously, even from different domains.
*   **CC-B5.3.4 (Semantic Integrity):** A `Role` **MAY** introduce additional constraints or required attributes that are more specific than those of the `U.Type` it refines, but it **SHALL NOT** contradict them.

**Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them**

| Anti-Pattern | Manager's View: What It Looks Like | How FPF Prevents It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The "Subtype Explosion"** | The list of system "types" in the project grows endlessly: `ThermodynamicSystem`, `EconomicSystem`, `SoftwareSystem`, etc. The ontology becomes bloated and unmanageable. | **CC-B5.3.2** forbids this. There is only one `U.System`. Different perspectives on it are modeled as `Role`s, which keeps the core ontology lean. |
| **The "Magic Synonym"** | A developer simply renames `U.System` to "Thermodynamic System" in their diagrams, but there are no formal rules or constraints attached. The term is just an alias. | The FPF pattern requires a formal `Role` with a `refinesType` link. This is a rich, structural connection, not just a cosmetic name change. |
| **The "One-Hat Fallacy"** | The model forces an entity to be only one thing. An asset can be a "Physical Component" or a "Financial Asset," but not both, leading to duplicated models. | **CC-B5.3.3** explicitly allows an entity to play multiple roles. A single server in your data center can simultaneously `play_role_of` "PhysicalComponent" (for Sys-CAL) and "DepreciableAsset" (for a financial architheory). |

**Consequences**

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Semantic Richness and Precision:** The pattern allows domain-specific constraints and rules to be formally integrated into the model, enabling much more powerful automated checking and reasoning. | **Increased Modeling Granularity:** It introduces a layer of indirection (`Entity → Role → U.Type`) that modelers must learn. *Mitigation:* Tooling can automate much of this, suggesting relevant roles based on the context or domain. |
| **Multi-Domain Integration:** The pattern provides a clean and robust mechanism for a single model to incorporate concepts from multiple, diverse domains without conflict. | - |
| **Preserves a Lean Kernel:** The FPF kernel remains small and universal, with all domain-specific complexity handled in a modular, plug-in fashion via `Role` libraries. | - |
| **Enhanced Traceability and Clarity:** The roles an entity plays are explicit assertions. This makes the model's intent clear and auditable. | - |

**Rationale**

The Role-Projection pattern is the cornerstone of FPF's approach to **universality with specificity**. It is a direct implementation of the **Open-Ended Kernel (P-4)** and **Plug-in Layering (P-5)** principles. By separating the timeless, universal concepts (`U.Types`) from their context-dependent, domain-specific interpretations (`Role`s), FPF achieves a powerful balance.

This approach is inspired by contemporary practices in both ontology engineering (e.g., the use of role concepts in foundational ontologies like UFO) and software architecture (e.g., aspect-oriented programming and role-based modeling), but it integrates them into a single, coherent pattern. It provides a formal, scalable, and semantically rich solution to the perennial problem of bridging the universal and the particular.

# C.2 · **KD‑CAL** — *Epistemic holon composition* \[A]  *(Architheory: CAL)*

**Scope & exports.** A substrate‑neutral calculus for composing **epistemic holons** (`U.Episteme`) and reasoning about their motion and equivalence. Exports: (i) three **point‑characteristics**—**Formality F**, **ClaimScope G**, **Reliability R**—that locate a single episteme; (ii) a **pairwise ladder** of **Congruence Levels (CL 0…3)**; (iii) four **Δ‑moves** (*Formalise, Generalise/Specialise, Calibrate/Validate, Congrue*); (iv) **composition rules** (Γ_epist) for aggregates; (v) propagation laws for CL through mappings and notation bridges. KD‑CAL sits on the `U.Episteme` *semantic triangle* (Symbol–Concept–Object) and never confuses **notation** with **carrier**. All F–G–R computations are **context‑local**; Cross‑context traversals **require** an explicit **Bridge** with **CL** and apply the **B.3** congruence penalty **Φ(CL)** to **R**.  // Contexts ≡ U.BoundedContext; substitution is plane‑preserving only.

**Formality F** is the rigor characteristic defined **normatively in C.2.3**. All KD‑CAL computations and guards **SHALL** use `U.Formality` (F0…F9) as specified there; **no parallel “mode” ladders** are allowed.

## 1 · Context

FPF fixes two archetypal sub‑holons: **`U.System`** (physical/operational) and **`U.Episteme`** (knowledge holon). KD‑CAL is the **home architheory** of `U.Episteme`, giving engineers a compact, testable way to say (a) how strictly an episteme is written (**F**), (b) how much structure it manages (**G**), (c) how well it is warranted by evidence or severe tests (**R**), and (d) how closely **two** epistemes coincide (**CL**). KD‑CAL is built atop **C.2.1 U.Episteme — Semantic Triangle via Components**, which reifies every episteme as **Concept** (claim‑graph), **Object** (aboutness & evaluation rules), and **Symbol** (notation)—*not the file itself*; **carriers** and **work/executions** remain outside and are linked via `isCarriedBy` / `producedBy(U.Work)`.

## 2 · Problem

Teams routinely entangle **programs, specifications, proofs, and datasets**; a “proof” is treated as a tested routine, a “program” is cited as if it entailed a theorem. **Trust decays** because justification and evidence freshness are not explicit. Epistemes are anthropomorphised as actors (“the standard enforces…”), producing **category errors at execution**. Without a shared composition and equivalence calculus, aggregates hide weakest links and analogies harden into overclaims. KD‑CAL must stop these failure modes with a **single constitution and scale‑set**.

---

## 3 · Forces

* **Universality vs domain idioms.** One calculus must host physics theories, legal codes, safety specs, algorithms, and formal proofs without flattening their differences.
* **Meaning vs materiality.** Meaning must be independent of carrier, yet accountable to it historically.
* **Deductive vs empirical.** Axiomatic certainty and empirical trust have different lifecycles; both must compose.
* **Abstraction vs enactment.** Epistemes constrain action; **systems** act. The calculus must keep the roles distinct.

## 4 · Solution

### 4.1 · Coordinates and the triangle

**KD‑CAL characteristics (single‑episteme, point‑values).**

* **Formality F.** From free prose to **machine‑checkable proof/specification**. Litmus: *would a machine reject it if wrong?*
* **Claim scope (G), a set‑valued applicability over `U.ContextSlice`, with ∩/SpanUnion/translate algebra; CL penalties apply to R, not to F/G.** Litmus: *how wide is the declared scope, and under what minimal assumptions does the claim hold?*
* **Reliability R.** From untested idea to **continuously validated claim**. Litmus: *where is the last successful severe test?* **R‑claims MUST bind to evidence and declare relevance windows; stale bindings degrade R or require waiver per ESG policy.**

 **Congruence Level (CL), pairwise ladder.**
 `CL‑0` **Opposed/Disjoint** (contrastive; no substitution); `CL‑1` **Comparable / Naming‑only** (label similarity; no substitution); `CL‑2` **Translatable / RoleAssignment‑eligible** (structure‑preserving mapping in a declared fragment with **stated loss**; theorems may transport); `CL‑3` **Near‑identity / Type‑structure‑safe** (invariants match; type‑structure substitution allowed). *CL is a characteristic of a relation between two epistemes; it is not a fourth axis of epistemic characteristic space.* **Norm:** *substitution is permitted only if plane‑preserving and **CL ≥ 2**; substituting **type‑structure** requires **CL = 3***.

**Triangle link.** The characteristics live on the **Concept↔Object** side: *F* by the internal claim‑graph structure; *G* by the **ClaimScope** (scope & assumptions); *R* by evaluation templates and evidence bindings. The **Symbol** vertex hosts notation; **carriers are outside** the episteme and link via `isCarriedBy`. Multiple notations are allowed under a **single Symbol component**; authors SHOULD register `NotationBridge(n₁,n₂)` with an associated **CL** to make conversion loss explicit.

### 4.2 · Four Δ‑moves (epistemic motion)

* ***ΔF — Formalise.** Rewrite for stricter calculi/grammars; raise proof obligations.
* ***ΔG — Generalise / Specialise.** Widen or narrow the **claim scope** (assumptions & scope). Changes to decomposition granularity are an **orthogonal view** and do not change **G** unless they alter the envelope.
* **ΔR — Calibrate / Validate.** Strengthen severe tests or add live monitoring; update evidence bindings.
* **ΔCL — Congrue.** Establish and record the sameness relation between **two** epistemes (ladder 0→3).
  Moves compose into **paths**; CL along a path is the **minimum** of its links.

### 4.3 · Composition (Γ\_epist) and propagation

Let **Γ\_epist** combine epistemes `{Eᵢ}` into a composite episteme **Γ** that makes a joint claim (*AND‑style*) or exposes an interface (*series composition*). KD‑CAL imposes **safe defaults**:

* **R (Reliability).** Along any justification **path** `P`, compute **`R_eff(P) = max(0, min_i R_i − Φ(CL_min(P)))`** (weakest‑link with congruence penalty). For **series** composition (claims needed conjunctively), the path‑wise weakest‑link applies; for **parallel** support (independent lines to the *same* claim), use **`R(Γ) = max_P R_eff(P)`** (annotate independence); never exceed the best attested line. Cross‑context steps and **NotationBridge** traversals contribute to `CL_min(P)`.

* **F (Formality).** `F(Γ) = minᵢ F(Eᵢ)` (monotone non‑increasing along used paths). To raise **F**, apply **ΔF** to the weakest parts.
* **G (ClaimScope).** On any dependency **path**, take the **intersection** of claim scopes (the **narrowest overlapping scope**). Across **independent support paths to the same claim**, set **`G(Γ) = SpanUnion({G_path})` constrained by support** (drop unsupported regions). Widening/narrowing the scope is an explicit **ΔG±** operation.
* **CL (Congruence).** For a chain of mappings `E₀ ~ E₁ ~ … ~ Eₖ`, the **path congruence** is `min CL(Eⱼ,Eⱼ₊₁)`. Passing through a **NotationBridge** sets CL to the bridge’s declared level; the **Φ(CL)** penalty is applied in the **R** fold for any path that traverses it.

These rules keep Γ aligned with the **holonic kernel**: Γ is only defined on holons and respects identity/boundary discipline from the core. 

### 4.4 · What **must not** be conflated (normative guards)

* **Symbol ≠ carrier.** Files, PDFs, or repositories are **carriers** outside the episteme; they never count as parts of `U.Episteme` (**see C.2.1 EP‑1; CC‑EPI‑2/3**).
* **Epistemes do not act.** Only **systems** perform work; epistemes constrain/evaluate via **Object** and **Concept** (**per Core A.15 / CC‑EPI‑3**).
* **CL is not a score.** It is a **qualitative ladder** of preservation strength; do not average it. 

---

## 5 · ✱ Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

**Universal rule (tell).** *Compose knowledge by Γ\_epist with weakest‑link R, monotone F, and explicit CL on every bridge; keep Symbol–Concept–Object separate and never turn a carrier into a part.*

**System (show, Sys‑CAL lens).** Consider a **battery‑pack thermal subsystem** integrating a physics model of heat flow and an operating envelope for fast‑charge. As a **system**, it composes pumps, sensors, and controllers by physical Γ with conservation constraints (Sys‑CAL). The assurance story depends on epistemes about the model and envelope; the system **acts**, epistemes constrain. (Archetypes and boundary discipline per core.)

**Episteme (show, KD‑CAL lens).** Consider a **CMIP‑class climate projection episteme** (post‑2015 generation): its **Concept** is a claim‑graph over PDEs and parameterisations; its **Object** defines an claim scope (historical forcings, resolution); its **Symbol** may include two notations (domain equations vs. tabular schema) linked by a **NotationBridge** with an explicit CL. Compose sub‑epistemes for radiation, clouds, and ocean mixing: `R = min` across the critical path; an independent hindcast line can raise `R` only up to its own level; `F` is bounded by the least‑formal sub‑claim unless the composition adds formal invariants.

---

## 6 · Bias‑Annotation

* **Metric worship.** Treating `[F,G,R]` as ends rather than means; mitigation: require **evidence bindings** and narrative of limits in the Object envelope.
* **Category slip.** Equating a notation or its carrier with the Concept; mitigation: Symbol–carrier separation and EP‑1 triangle cardinality.
* **Analogy inflation.** Presenting CL‑0/1 as identity; mitigation: always name the **CL rung** for cross‑mappings.

---

## 7 · Conformance Checklist

1. **C2‑1 (Triangle).** Every `U.Episteme` **MUST** occupy exactly one slot per {Symbol, Concept, Object}; carriers link via `isCarriedBy` and are never parts.
2. **C2‑2 (Coordinates).** Each episteme **SHALL** declare `[F,G,R]` with a brief rationale; **F** is `U.Formality ∈ {F0…F9}` per **C.2.3**, **exactly one episteme‑level F** computed as the **min over essential parts**. CL is declared for **pairs only**. Sub‑anchors: ** Contexts **MAY** mint named sub‑anchors (e.g., `F4[OCL]`, `F7[HOL]`), which **MUST** preserve the global order and **map to their parent anchor** from C.2.3.
3. **C2‑3 (Composition).** Authors **SHALL** choose Γ_mode (**series** vs **parallel**). For any justification **path** use **`R_eff(P) = max(0, min_i R_i − Φ(CL_min(P)))`**; for **parallel** independent lines to the *same claim*, take **`R(Γ) = max_P R_eff(P)`** (never exceeding the strongest line). Compute `F(Γ) = min` along the used paths. For **G**, use **path‑wise intersections** and then **SpanUnion({G_path}) constrained by support**. Cross‑context traversals **MUST** use a Bridge with **CL** and apply **Φ(CL)** to `R`.
4. **C2‑4 (NotationBridge).** Multi‑notation Symbol components **SHOULD** register `NotationBridge` edges with CL and loss note; any cross‑notation reasoning **MUST** cite the bridge’s CL.
5. **C2‑5 (No action).** Epistemes **MUST NOT** be assigned actions; work is executed by systems in role.

---

## 8 · Consequences

**Benefits.** A single, compact **map** for all knowledge artefacts; fast detection of weakest‑link **R** in aggregates; disciplined reuse across domains with explicit **CL**; consistent separation of **meaning** from **material carriers**.
**Trade‑offs.** Authors must learn to declare Γ‑mode and CL explicitly; multi‑notation work requires bridge bookkeeping; *mitigation:* the triangle and ladder keep the discipline brief and repeatable.

---

## 9 · Rationale

KD‑CAL externalises a long‑standing semiotic insight (Sign–Meaning–Referent) into a **holonic composition** where syntax/structure (**F,G**), pragmatics/evidence (**R**), and cross‑mapping strength (**CL**) are visible and composable. The explicit triangle (C.2.1) prevents carrier confusion; the characteristic provide a **manager‑readable** yet **formalisation‑ready** scale (with **G** grounded in **scope/envelope**, not part‑count); the CL ladder replaces overloaded “alignment” with a graded sameness notion.

---

## 10 · Relations

* **Depends on:** `U.Episteme — Semantic Triangle via Components` (C.2.1): identity invariants EP‑1, Symbol–Concept–Object definitions, evidence bindings.
* **Peers:** **Sys‑CAL** (C.1), which composes **systems**; KD‑CAL composes **epistemes** and feeds assurance lenses in Part B.
* **Constrained by authoring:** `[A]` patterns must include Tell–Show–Show with **Archetypal Grounding** (this section).

---

## 11 · Worked mini‑examples (post‑2015 flavours)

* **Formal lift (ΔF).** Recasting a 2019 **variational free‑energy** narrative into a typed calculus raises **F**, clarifies scope, and enables CL‑2 bridges between biological and ML formulations—*without* claiming empirical gain (**R** unchanged).
* **Parallel evidence (R, max).** Two independent **hindcast** lines (circa CMIP6, 2019) supporting the same forecast allow `R(Γ)=max(R₁,R₂)`; if one line drifts, the composite is bounded by the stronger line until series constraints apply.
* **Notation bridge (CL drop).** A 2021 **type‑theoretic specification** rendered in a semi‑formal DSL requires a `NotationBridge` with a CL<3 note; any theorem transported across must respect the bridge’s declared preservation.

*(No tooling is implied; these are conceptual moves within the calculus.)*



# C.2.1 · **U.Episteme — Semantic Triangle via Components**  \[A]

> **One‑line summary.** An **episteme** is a knowledge holon whose **Concept** (intension/claim‑graph), **Object** (aboutness & testability), and **Symbol** (notation/representation—*not carriers*) form a disciplined **semantic triangle** pointing to its **topic holons**.  Triangle sides are `expresses(Symbol,Concept)` and `anchors(Concept,Object)`. The `about(Object→TopicHolon)` and `isCarriedBy(Episteme→Carrier)` are external links (not triangle sides).

## 1 · Context

FPF’s kernel recognises two archetypal sub‑holons: **System** and **Episteme**. Systems are operational wholes; **epistemes** are **knowledge holons**—theories, models, specifications, standards, algorithms, proofs—whose reason for being is to **say something defeasible or deductive about something** and to be **held to account** by justification. In the kernel, **Strict Distinction** forbids us from conflating a thing with its description or its carrier; **I/D/S** in Part E adds the teaching rule *Intension ≠ Description ≠ Specification*. KD‑CAL must now **operationalise** this for epistemes: what they *are*, *how* their parts hang together, and *how* they point to the world.

**Readers.** Engineering managers and lead designers who need a uniform way to reason about **theories, specifications, algorithms, proofs**—from charter memos up to formal axiomatics—without collapsing into tooling or discipline‑specific notations.

---

## 2 · Problem

Without a shared **episteme constitution**, teams fall into recurring failure modes:

1. **Object–Description–Carrier soup.** Diagrams and files are treated as *the theory itself*. Changes to a PDF are confused with theoretical change.
2. **Aboutness blur.** A spec seems to describe “everything in general”. The **topic**—*what exactly this knowledge is about*—is implicit and drifts.
3. **Proof vs program confusion.** Algorithms, specifications, and proofs are mixed: a “proof” is used as if it were a tested routine; a “program” is cited as if it entailed a theorem (Curry–Howard misunderstood).
4. **Unanchored trust.** Claims accumulate with no explicit **justification graph** or **evidence freshness**, so assurance degrades invisibly.
5. **Category errors at execution.** Epistemes appear as *actors* (“the standard enforces…”) instead of **systems** acting *with* or *on* epistemes.

KD‑CAL must fix a **single, substrate‑neutral semantic triangle** and the **component slots** of an episteme so that claims, justification, carriers, and topics stay aligned—and so that trust (F‑G‑R) and provenance compose safely across contexts.

## 4 · Solution

### 4.1 The Semantic Triangle via Components

**Identity invariants (normative).**  
A `U.Episteme`’s identity consists of: (i) the persistent root `U.Episteme` identifier within its `U.BoundedContext`; and (ii) the **role‑complete** occupancy of the three component slots `{Object, Concept, Symbol}` (EP‑1). Any change to slot cardinality or any swap of a slot’s **value** that alters the declared `ClaimGraph` (Concept) or `Designation & Reference Map` (Object) **MUST** be realised as a new `PhaseOf` edition (§19). Changes confined to the `Symbol` component’s **Notation‑Set/NotationBridge** do **NOT** create a new edition.

We reify **U.Episteme** as a holon with **exactly three reified epistemic components** and two pointing relations, each protected by kernel rules:
 
 **EP‑1 (normative — triangle cardinality, multi‑notation safe).**  
 A conformant `U.Episteme` **MUST** have exactly one `U.EpistemicComponent` per role **{Object, Concept, Symbol}**. The **Symbol** value MAY be a `U.Collection` of **NotationDescriptor** items (“Notation-Set”), preserving *one* Symbol component while allowing many notations. Carriers are structural  artefacts (outside the Triangle) **Symbol ≠ Carrier**; link via `isCarriedB`.

**Triangle sides (normative labels).**
Triangle sides are `expresses(Symbol,Concept)` and `anchors(Concept,Object)`.  The `about(Object→TopicHolon)` and `isCarriedBy(Episteme→Carrier)` are external links (not triangle sides).

 **Triangle Role Map (normative): vertices and what they host**
* **Concept (intension).** Hosts the *claim‑level content* as a **ClaimGraph** (definitions, axioms, theorems, requirements, properties, assumptions).  
* **Object (aboutness link).** Hosts the **Reference Map** (designation rules, claim scope, evaluation/measurement templates) that ties claims to **Topic holons** (`U.System` or `U.Episteme`).  
* **Symbol (notation).** Hosts the **notation/representation** (e.g., syntax, signature, term dictionaries, rendering rules). **Symbol ≠ `U.Carrier`**; physical files are **Carriers** and live **outside this Triangle**. 

The following governance graphs are **not** triangle vertices but **attached structures**:  
* **JustificationGraph** (arguments & evidence lines for claims) attaches to **Concept**;  
* **EditionSeries** (PhaseOf chain) governs the episteme’s temporal phases.
* **Evidence Bindings** (per‑claim `U.EvidenceRole` assignments); **status‑only; not parts**.

1. **`U.ClaimGraph` (Content).** The *intensional* body—typed statements, definitions, axioms, theorems, requirements, constraints.
   *Didactic cue:* “What is being *said*?”
   *Discipline:* Nodes are **typed claims**; edges are **logical/derivational** or **refinement** links; no execution logs here.

2. **`U.JustificationGraph` (Why to trust).** Arguments, derivations, calibrations, replications—**non‑self** justifications that **support, refute, or constrain** nodes in the ClaimGraph.
   *Didactic cue:* “Why believe this here?”
   *Discipline:* Uses **Evidence Anchoring**; brings in **U.EvidenceRole** bindings to external artefacts; deductive and empirical lines are kept distinct; freshness policies live here.

3. **`U.EditionSeries` (Phases).** The **temporal phases** of the episteme (editions/versions), linked by **PhaseOf**; describes evolution **without** confusing edition with parts.
   *Didactic cue:* “When did the content change?”

**Pointing relations (outside the episteme holon)**
1. `about` → `U.TopicHolon` (from **Object/Reference Map** to its targets).  
2. `isCarriedBy` → `U.Carrier` (**from the episteme as a whole** to its carriers).  
3. `aboutEpisteme` → **U.Episteme|Claim** (episteme‑level reference; ReferencePlane=episteme).

**Reflexivity (normative).** When a claim refers to an episteme that includes the referring claim (self‑reference), the publisher SHALL (i) declare ReferencePlane=episteme, and (ii) ensure **acyclicity per evaluation chain** (no justification cycle in JustificationGraph). Reflexive references MAY exist as literature anchors but MUST NOT form a minimal support cycle for acceptance.

*Carrier rule (normative):* **No carriers in `U.ClaimGraph` or `U.JustificationGraph`.** Symbols denote **notation/representation**; carriers are **structural artefacts** referenced via `isCarriedBy`. One **Symbol** component MAY point to a `U.Collection` of notation descriptors; each descriptor may in turn be *carried by* many artefacts. 

**Strict Distinction guard.** *Content* (ClaimGraph) ≠ *Description* (notations on carriers) ≠ *Carrier* (paper/file/etc.). The **episteme** is neither the file nor the drawing; those are **carriers**. The “recipe” or formalisation you read is a **description**; the **intensional content** is what different descriptions must agree on **in context**.

**One‑screen sketch (notation‑neutral)**

```
U.Episteme
 ├─ ClaimGraph (typed claims; no logs)
 ├─ JustificationGraph (arguments; evidence bindings; freshness)
 └─ EditionSeries (PhaseOf chain)

Links:
  about ───────► TopicHolon (System or Episteme)
  isCarriedBy ─► {Carrier…} (symbol bearers)
```

**Curry–Howard lens (for formal contexts, informative).**
Where a context endorses Curry–Howard:

* **Propositions** in `ClaimGraph` are **types**;
* **Proofs** in `JustificationGraph` are **program‑like derivations**;
* **Proof checking** is **Work** done by a **system**; the resulting checked artefact is a **carrier** for a **proof episteme**; nothing “executes itself”.

* **ReferencePlane ∈ {world, concept, episteme}** MUST be declared for each episteme:
* `world` (empirical/object‑level): claims are about systems/phenomena; **validation** uses measurement/evaluation templates; **verification** checks internal derivations only.
* `concept` (concept‑level): claims are about concepts/models not tied to a specific observed system; verification dominates; validation is contextual if concepts are later applied.
* `episteme` (episteme‑level): claims are **about other epistemes/claims**. Use **aboutEpisteme** for such links; do **not** treat them as domain‑aboutness.

**Normative guards.** (i) When `ReferencePlane=Episteme`, `about`‑edges **MUST** target epistemes/claims (not domain systems) and cross‑level penalties apply in assurance (CL^plane in B.3). (ii) KD‑CAL patterns that consume `U.Episteme` **MUST** surface `ReferencePlane`; consumers **MUST NOT** silently assume domain‑aboutness.

### 4.2 Operators & algebra (normative, notation‑neutral)

 **Typed relations on claims (in‑Context):**
 `supports(e, c)`, `refutes(e, c)`, `constrains(e, c)`, `neutral(e, c)`, where `e` is an `U.EvidenceRole` binding and `c` resolves in the context’s claim graph.
 
**Reliability with congruence penalty.** Let a support path `P` from `e` to `c` have per‑edge reliability `R_i` and minimal **congruence** `CL_min(P)` (including any **NotationBridge** or **aboutEpisteme** traversals). Define: 
 
 \t**R_eff(P) := max(0, min_i R_i − Φ(CL_min(P)))**
 
where `Φ` is the context’s monotone penalty (lower CL ⇒ larger penalty). Multi‑path support uses `max_P R_eff(P)`; conflict resolution uses context policy (e.g., refutation wins when `R_refute > R_support + δ`).  // WLNK/CL per KD‑CAL. 
 
 **Formality & ClaimScope folds.** On a path `P`, take `F(P) = min_i F_i`, `G(P) = ⋂_i G_i` (expressed as the tightest envelope; empty set ⇒ path void).
 
 **Assurance tuple.** For a claim `c` at time `t`, KD‑CAL exports `Assurance(c,t) = ⟨F*, G*, R*⟩` computed under Γ_epist folds with decay applied. Mapping to `AssuranceLevel ∈ {L0,L1,L2}` is policy‑based on thresholds `{τ_F, τ_R}` and coverage tests on `G*`.

**ProofKernel (for F≥7 claims, normative).** When claims are expressed with machine-checked proofs (typically **F≥7**, see C.2.3), declare `ProofKernel ∈ {Classical-LOG, Constructive-LOG, Univalent-LOG}`. **Proof bindings do not decay**; only **Tool/Typing Assurance (TA)** may decay. **Declaring a `ProofKernel` binds the claim to §18.1 F-threshold gates; legacy “modes/tiers” are not used.**
 
### 4.3 Decay functions & Epistemic‑Debt ledger (normative)

**Decay.** A context **MUST** define decay classes for empirical evidence (e.g., `none`, `half‑life h`, `cliff at T`). At evaluation time `t`, apply decay to `R` before composition. **For claims at **F≥7**, proof bindings carry `decay = none`; their associated **TA** (toolchain) may decay.**
 
 **Debt.** Expired or missing refresh spawns a ledger entry:
 `Debt(e) = {since, claimRef, severity, plannedAction ∈ {Refresh, Deprecate, Waive}}`.
 Waivers are `U.SpeechAct`‑backed and time‑boxed.
 
 **Refresh.** New bindings supersede old; past `U.Work` remains judged under the binding valid at the time of execution (no retroactive rewrite).
 
### 4.5 · Normative components & relations 

> The full formal clauses appear in Quarter 2; here we fix the **names and roles** of the components so later sections can reference them unambiguously.

#### 4.5.1 `U.ClaimGraph` (Content)

**Purpose.** Hold the *intended meaning* as a graph of **typed claims** under a declared **Bounded Context**. 
**Triangle placement (normative):** `U.ClaimGraph` is the **internal structure of the `Concept` component**. It is **not** a carrier and **not** a run log.
**Typical node kinds (context‑local):** `Definition`, `Axiom`, `Theorem`, `Requirement`, `SpecClause`, `Property`, `Assumption`.
**Edges:** `dependsOn`, `refines`, `entails`, `incompatibleWith` (context defines exact repertory).
**Rule of economy.** Keep *operational facts* (runs, measures) **out**—they live on `U.Work` and are imported via **JustificationGraph** when needed as evidence.

#### 4.5.2 `U.JustificationGraph` (Why to trust)

**Purpose.** Record the **arguments** and **evidence links** that justify, constrain, or refute `ClaimGraph` nodes.

**Triangle placement (normative):** `U.JustificationGraph` is **governance attached to the `Concept` component** (per‑claim). It is **not** a fourth triangle vertex. Deductive vs empirical lines **MUST** be tagged for B.3 (F–G–R) computation. 

**Sources:**
* **Deductive**: derivations, equiconsistency meta‑results (version‑fenced);
* **Empirical**: observations, test reports, calibrations, replications (with freshness).
* **Interface to KD‑CAL trust:** Every support/counter‑support edge computes a **local** ⟨F, G, R⟩ (Formality–ClaimScope–Reliability) contribution; aggregation lives in **B.3**.
* **Non‑self‑evidence (normative).** Evidence must come from **external Work** performed by **systems**; an episteme cannot **evidence itself**.  
* **Informal rationale (M‑mode, gated).** An `InformalRationale` binding MAY be used at M‑mode to explain intent, but it **automatically** accrues **Epistemic Debt** with a short default window; it CANNOT move an edition to *Effective* alone.

#### 4.5.3 `U.EditionSeries` (Phases)

**Purpose.** Bind editions/versions by **PhaseOf**, preserving history without confusing time with parts.
**Rules (preview).** Past editions are immutable; bridges across contexts treat editions explicitly; provenance of edits is recorded as external Work on carriers (editing, review, ratification) but **does not** turn Work into content.

#### 4.5.4 `about` → `U.TopicHolon`

**Purpose.** Make **aboutness** explicit. A knowledge holon must say **which holon(s)** it concerns (systems, or even other epistemes for meta‑work).
**Triangle placement (normative):** The **Object** component **hosts** the Reference Map from which `about` edges are derived. Topic scope (generic vs specific) **MUST** be declared within the same `U.BoundedContext`.
**Scope.** Aboutness may be **generic** (class of systems) or **specific** (this pump, this workflow), but must be **declared** in the same context as the episteme.

#### 4.5.5 `isCarriedBy` → `U.Carrier`

**Purpose.** Tie the episteme to its **symbol bearers** (papers, models, listings).
**Rule of separation.** Carriers may be many; replacing a carrier **does not** change the episteme’s identity, unless the **edition** (PhaseOf) changes content.
**Carrier vs Symbol guard (normative):**  
* **Symbol** = notation/representation (triangle vertex);  
* **Carrier** = artefact that bears an inscription (a **physical structural** fact about the carrier itself); the **`isCarriedBy`** link is **epistemic** (representation-bearing), **not** a part–whole claim.  
* **Validation note.** For `isCarriedBy`, **declare** `validationMode ∈ {inferential, postulate}` and ground via **Logical/Mapping** and/or **Empirical Validation** as appropriate. 
 
Replacing a carrier **does not** change identity; changing **Concept/Object/Symbol** **does** and **MUST** mint a new **Phase** in `EditionSeries`.  

### 4.6 The Component Model of an Epistemic Holon

**Aim.** Turn the classic semiotic triangle (Sign ↔ Meaning ↔ Referent) into a **holonic composition** for `U.Episteme`, aligned with **A.7 Strict Distinction**, **A.14 Advanced Mereology**, **B.3 Trust & Assurance**, and **C.2 KD‑CAL**.

**The three vertices (triangle) and their holonic realization**

1. **Symbol (Notation) — S‑vertex.**
   *Component:* **`Symbol`** — the **notation/representation** bundle (syntax, signature, term dictionaries). A **single** Symbol component MAY hold a **Notation‑Set** (`U.Collection<NotationDescriptor>`), e.g., {SBVR, OWL 2 DL, Lean/Agda surface}.
   *Relations:* The **episteme** (not the Symbol vertex) uses `isCarriedBy(Carrier)` to reference **Carriers** (files, PDFs, repos).  
  *Mereology guard (normative):* **Carriers are never parts of `U.Episteme`.** They are **external `U.Carrier` encodings** linked via `isCarriedBy`. 
   *Notation‑Bridge (new, normative):* When a Notation‑Set contains multiple notations, authors **SHOULD** register `NotationBridge(n₁,n₂)` edges with **CL** (congruence‑loss) and brief loss notes; use these CLs in KD‑CAL penalties when evidence or claims traverse between notations. 

3. **Meaning / Intension (M‑vertex).**
   *Component:* **`ClaimGraph`** — the **claim & definition graph** (terms, axioms, theorems, models, constraints) **inside one `U.BoundedContext`**.
   *Relations:* `defines(U.Type/Term)`, `asserts(U.Claim)`, `dependsOn(U.Claim)`; **`expresses(Symbol, Concept)`** binds notation to these claims (label the side explicitly).
   *Mereology guard:* The **intension** is not a carrier and not a run; it is the **core substantial component** of the episteme, captured as **A.14 ComponentOf** with **AspectOf** links for optional views (e.g., “mathematical aspect”, “operational aspect”).

4. **Referent / World‑link (R‑vertex).**
   *Component:* **`Designation & Reference Map`** — a **bundle** of (i) *designation rules* (what terms point to in a context), (ii) *measurement templates* and *evaluation clauses* (how claims are tested on real systems), and (iii) *claim scope* (where the episteme claims to hold).
   *Relations:* `appliesTo(U.System or Phenomenon)`, `evaluatedBy(U.MethodDescription)`, `hasEnvelope(CharacteristicSpace)`; label the side **`about/evaluates (Concept↔Object)`** for clarity. F/G/R are computed per KD‑CAL with WLNK/CL. 
   *Mereology guard:* Reference maps are **components** of the episteme’s **meaning‑to‑world interface**; they are **not** logs of experiments.

**The two indispensable cross‑edges (triangle sides)**

**S↔M (Expression).** A many‑to‑one relation **`expresses(Symbol, Concept)`** (notation expresses intension).  
*Notational independence (normative):* Multiple notations (one **Symbol component** possibly realized as a `U.Collection`) may **express the same Concept**. **Do not** equate carrier identity with meaning identity. Carriers connect to the episteme via `isCarriedBy`; there is **no** Symbol→Carrier mereology.

**M↔R (Aboutness & Testability).** Use **`about(Object, TopicHolon)`** and **`evaluatedBy(Object, MethodDescription)`**; the **Object/Reference Map** hosts designation rules and evaluation templates. This side is where **B.3 (F–G–R)** lives: **Formality** via the claim’s structure, **ClaimScope** via the envelope, **Reliability** via evaluation semantics and evidence.

* **Green rule (A.12 + A.7).** 
**No S→R action (normative):** No S→R action; only systems perform Work. A notation or carrier never changes the world. Only **`U.Work` performed by a `U.System` playing roles** can transform or observe. (Matches B.3’s separation of design‑time assurance from run‑time evidence.) 

**Mandatory internal components of `U.Episteme` (minimal, composable bill‑of‑materials)**

* *`ClaimGraph`** *(core)* — the meaning network.
* **`Symbol (Notation)`** — the notation/representation bundle (one component; carriers are linked via the **structural carrier** relation `isCarriedBy`. 
* **`Designation & Reference Map`** — terms → world, measurement templates, acceptance clauses, claim scope.
 
*Attached structures (not parts):* **JustificationGraph**, **Evidence Bindings** (per‑claim `U.EvidenceRole` assignments), **EditionSeries**, **Scope Card**.

Semantic Parallelogram (optional): vertices = {Symbol, Concept, Object, TopicHolon}; edges = triangle(S–C–O) + about(Object→TopicHolon). **Carriers are linked via `isCarriedBy` (structural carrier link)**.  No direct S→TopicHolon edge.

## 5 · Conformance Checklist 

Preview kernel-level:

* **CC‑EPI‑1 (Locality).** Every `U.Episteme` **MUST** declare a `U.BoundedContext` and speak only with that Context’s vocabulary and invariants.
* **CC‑EPI‑2 (Triangle present).** Every U.Episteme MUST expose the three components `{Object, Concept, Symbol}` and the two external links `about(Object→TopicHolon)` and `isCarriedBy(Episteme→Carrier)`. `ClaimGraph`, `JustificationGraph`, and `EditionSeries` are attached/internal structures, not triangle vertices.
* **CC‑EPI‑3 (Strict Distinction).** It is **non‑conformant** to treat carriers or notations as the episteme, or to place Work/execution facts inside `ClaimGraph`.
* **CC‑EPI‑4 (No self‑evidence).** Edges in `JustificationGraph` that rely on evidence **MUST** point to **external Work** and **evidence roles**; self‑support is forbidden.
* **CC‑EPI‑5 (Aboutness explicit).** `about` **MUST** name **topic holons** (systems or epistemes). **Note (assurance gating).** Epistemes lacking `about(Object→TopicHolon)` **or** a declared **ReferencePlane** (C.2.3 **CC‑UE‑06**) may be published as didactic/template, but **do not satisfy Effective guards** in assurance (see B.3 SCR duties).
* **CC‑EPI‑6 (Phase discipline).** Content change implies a **new phase** in `EditionSeries`; carrier changes without content change are not new phases.

Normative:

**CC–KD‑1 · Evidence anchoring.** Every normative epistemic claim **MUST** be backed by an `U.EvidenceRole` binding on a `U.Episteme` (holder), with `claimRef`, `claimScope`, `polarity`, and a `timespan`; carriers **MUST** be SCR/RSCR‑anchored (A.10).
**CC–KD‑2 · Formal vs empirical line.** Each binding **MUST** declare `epistemicMode ∈ {formal, postulative}`; formal bindings are fenced to a `U.TheoryVersion`; empirical bindings **MUST** include method/protocol references (`U.MethodDescription`) and `fromWorkSet` (external `U.Work`).
**CC–KD‑3 · No self‑evidence.** The producing `U.Work` **MUST** be performed by a **system** (A.2/A.3). Epistemes never enact `U.Work`.
 **CC–KD‑4 · F–G–R computation.** The F–G–R triple **MUST** be computed **in‑Context** (same `U.BoundedContext`). Cross‑context inputs require an explicit Bridge (F.9) and apply a **CL penalty** (see C.2.11).
**CC–KD‑5 · Γ_epist discipline.** Composition over evidence paths **SHALL** use the Γ_epist defaults:
   • **R** = min over path reliabilities (weakest‑link),
   • **G** = intersection‑like restriction to overlapping applicability windows,
   • **F** = min over formality along the path.
   Contexts MAY tighten these folds but MUST NOT weaken monotonicity.
**CC–KD‑6 · Decay & debt.** Empirical bindings **MUST** specify a refresh/expiry policy; expired bindings accrue **Epistemic Debt** (B.3.4) that MUST be resolved by **Refresh / Deprecate / Waive** with a dated `U.SpeechAct`.
**CC–KD‑7 · Weight models.** If a numeric weight/score is used, the binding **MUST** cite a named `weight.modelRef` and provide all required inputs; ad‑hoc numbers are non‑conformant.
**CC–KD‑8 · TA/VA/LA attribution.** Each binding **MUST** declare `assuranceUse ∈ {TA, VA, LA}`. Aggregation **MUST** keep the three contributions separable through to the computed `AssuranceLevel` (B.3.3).
**CC–KD‑9 · Version fences.** Any version bump of the claim host or the episteme **MUST** yield a new binding; in‑place mutation is forbidden.
**CC–KD‑10 · Service separation.** KPIs for services are computed from `U.Work` and then **may** be bound as evidence epistemes; `U.Service` itself never carries actuals (A.2.3).
**CC–KD‑11 · Run/design split.** Do not attach run facts to `U.MethodDescription`; do not treat logs as descriptions. Temporal duality (A.4) applies.
**CC–KD‑12 · Reproducibility tag.** Empirical bindings **MUST** carry a reproducibility status {independent, internal, not‑replicated, irreproducible}.

**Epistemic Constituent Mereology (additive clause, normative)**  
**CС‑EPI‑M1 (Domain/Range).** The only _epistemic_ mereological relation admitted into a Γ‑foldable `DependencyGraph` is **`ConstituentOf`** with **`Domain = Range = U.Episteme`**. It captures **logical/content inclusion** among epistemes.  
**CС‑EPI‑M2 (No mapping‑as‑parthood).** Relations like **`RepresentationOf`**, **`UsageOf`**, **`Implements`**, and any _mapping/alignment_ links **MUST NOT** be used as `PartOf`‑family edges in `D`. Keep them at **value‑level** (with their own evidence/CL); `D`’s admissible edge set remains **{`ComponentOf`, `ConstituentOf`, `PortionOf`, `PhaseOf`}**.  
**CС-EPI-M3 (No cross-kind derivation).** Do **not** derive `EpiPartOf` from `StructPartOf` or reuse **Γₘ** traces **across relation kinds**. Epistemic composition is justified in **KD-CAL** (Γ\_epist, LOG-shoulder), not by importing **structural** Constructive traces (**Γₘ**). 
 
## 6 · Consequences (manager’s view, informative)

**Benefits.**

* Clear **division of labour**: content vs justification vs carrier; fewer category errors in specs and standards.
* **Trust by design**: justification is not an appendix but a first‑class component; F‑G‑R scores can be read off the graph.
* **Pluralism without chaos**: aboutness localises scope; cross‑context reuse goes through explicit bridges rather than by label reuse.

**Costs.**
* A small up‑front discipline to draw the triangle; paid back by lower integration and audit costs later.

## 7 · Rationale & Alignment (short)

* **Kernel fit.** Uses A.1 (Episteme as holon), A.7 (Strict Distinction), **I/D/S** (E.10.D2), and the design–run split (A.4/A.15) to keep meaning clean.
* **KD‑CAL fit.** Prepares **F‑G‑R** computation (B.3) by making justification explicit and scope (aboutness) measurable.
* **Mereology fit.** Uses A.14: **ClaimGraph** and **JustificationGraph** are **components** of the episteme; **PhaseOf** handles editions; carriers stay **outside** mereology (representation link).
* **Curry–Howard fit.** Where adopted, it lives **inside** Claim/Justification roles (types vs proofs) without forcing it on non‑formal contexts.

## 9 Worked micro‑examples (informative)

**(a) Formal)** `Lemma42.proof#AxiomaticProofRole:GraphTheory`  
`F≈high, G=finite DAG, R=checker status`; no decay; CL penalty applies only if bridged to another Context’s vocabulary.

**(b) Empirical)** `Trial‑R3.csv#ModelFitEvidenceRole:Cardio_2026`  
`F` from protocol formalisation; `G` = {adults 40–65, env L}; `R` from replication ledger and sensor calibration; annual decay; debt if not refreshed.
 
**(c) Service KPI as evidence)** `SLA‑Q2.md#ServiceEvaluationRole:Ops_2026`  
Aggregates `U.Work` KPIs; binds as `supports` a policy claim “service meets target ≥ X%”.
 
## 10 Authoring & migration notes (informative)

* **Low-F authoring path (F0–F3).** Keep narrative short; defer heavy checklists until you raise **F**. At low-F it is sufficient to (i) state the **BoundedContext**, (ii) draw the triangle (Object/Concept/Symbol) and (iii) link any **external Work** you already have; formal templates and decay models are **optional**.
* **High-F authoring path (F≥7).** Publish full **ClaimGraph/JustificationGraph**, evidence freshness policy, and edition fences. Deductive proofs are fenced to **TheoryVersion**; empirical evidence declares **relevance windows** and decay (§4.3); bindings are renewed on theory or envelope change. **If machine-checked proofs are present (F≥7), declare `ProofKernel` and attach TA; proofs themselves do not decay.**
* **Context discipline.** Always write **Contexts on bindings**; relate Contexts via **Bridges** and **CL** only; never rely on label equality for meaning.
* **Assurance lanes.** Keep **TA/VA/LA** lanes separate through to the computed `AssuranceLevel`; do not average across lanes. # B.3.3 levels and lanes.
* **Weight models.** If numeric weights are used, they must cite a named model; ad-hoc numbers are discouraged even at **low-F** и **forbidden** at **high-F** gating.

## 11 · Didactic Cards (carry‑away lines for managers)

* **Triangle first.** Say what is claimed, why to trust it, where it lives; then point to whom it is about.
* **Documents don’t act.** Epistemes constrain; **systems** perform work.
* **Content change ⇒ new phase.** Carrier swaps alone do not change content.
* **Proof ≠ program (unless declared).** Curry–Howard applies only inside a declared **ProofKernel** and **BoundedContext** (see §12.3).
* **Label the sides.** Always write **expresses (S↔M)** and **about/evaluates (M↔O)** on the triangle.

## 12 · KD‑CAL Interfaces — What `U.Episteme` Must Export/Obey

This pattern sits as the **front door** of **KD‑CAL (C.2)**: it turns epistemic holons into **well‑formed participants** of the knowledge calculus: composition, F‑G‑R scoring, provenance, and decay. *(KD‑CAL is listed in Part C as the calculus for epistemic holon composition, F‑G‑R characteristics, and provenance; this pattern provides its structural “shape”.)*

**12.1 Exports to KD‑CAL (normative)**

* Export‑E0 (Aboutness minimum).** Every U.Episteme that is consumed by KD‑CAL / Assurance MUST surface:
(a) an explicit `about` edge to its TopicHolon (Object component),
(b) `ReferencePlane ∈ {world | concept | episteme}`,
(c) declared evidence lanes (TA/LA/VA) intended to support R.
These fields MUST be readable to SCR/RSCR consumers.

* **Export-E1 (Low-F minimal).** A resolvable **`ConceptHandle`** (may be a single root claim or a short list); **BoundedContext** declared.
* **Export‑E2 (Assurance L1+).** **claim scope** and **evaluation templates** from the **Object** component; **Evidence slots** exposed for `supports|refutes|constrains`. # Maps to L1 “Substantiated”. 
* **Export-E3 (Assurance L2 / high-F).** **`ClaimGraphRoot`** with typed nodes, **JustificationGraph** hooks, **EditionSeries** fence, and decay policy on empirical bindings (B.3.4).
* **Export‑E4 (Cross‑context).** Bridge metadata (CL, losses) for any exported handle that leaves the Context.

**12.2 Obligations under KD‑CAL (normative; tiered)**

* **Obl‑A (F‑G‑R determinacy).** The episteme must allow KD‑CAL to compute an **assurance triple** ⟨F, G, R⟩ for **each** named claim. At **low-F (≤F3)**, F/G/R may be **ordinal proxies**; at **high-F (≥F7)** they follow the numeric/coverage rules of B.3 (§4.4 skeleton).
* **Obl‑B (Weakest‑Link safety).** When claims compose, **Γ\_epist** uses **conservative folds** (min/∧/“weakest‑link”) unless the episteme provides a stricter, justified rule (B.1.3).
* **Obl‑C (Bridge transparency).** Cross‑context use **MUST** declare **CL (congruence level)** and **loss notes**; KD‑CAL will penalise **R** accordingly (B.3).
* **Obl‑D (Decay discipline).** Empirical evidence **MUST** carry a **relevance window**; expired items accrue **epistemic debt** until **Refresh/Deprecate/Waive** is recorded.

**12.3 ProofKernel declaration (formal contexts)**
* **Kernel.** `ProofKernel ∈ {Classical‑LOG, Constructive‑LOG, Univalent‑LOG}` MUST be declared when **claims at F≥7** rely on machine-checked proofs; each kernel constrains admissible proof objects and transports (e.g., proof terms in Lean). # Allows constructive/univalent maths explicitly.
* **CH scope.** Curry–Howard identifications (proposition↔type; proof↔program) are **valid only within the declared ProofKernel & Context** and **do not** imply executability claims about systems.


## 13 · Mereology of Knowledge — Using A.14 Safely Inside `U.Episteme` (clarifications)

**Why this matters.** Many modelling errors come from stuffing *roles, runs, or recipes* into an episteme’s part tree. This section fixes the **only** mereological edges allowed **inside** an episteme.

**13.1 Allowed edges (A.14 subtypes)**

* **ComponentOf** *(structure of meaning & interface)*: `ClaimGraph`, `Designation&ReferenceMap`, `Symbol` (notation bundle; may be a `U.Collection` of notations), “Front‑matter” (glossary, scope card), “Back‑matter” (index).
* **PortionOf** *(extensional subsets)*: a **selected subset** of claims or examples (e.g., “Ch. 3 as a portion of the treatise”).
* **AspectOf** *(orthogonal views)*: formal aspect vs narrative aspect of the same claim set.
* **PhaseOf** *(editions)*: v1 → v2 → v3 (no backward mutation of prior phases).

**13.2 Forbidden edges**

* **No roles in BoM.** Roles (Author, Reviewer, Standard) are **masks** worn via **RoleAssigning**; they are **not parts**.
* **No Work as part.** Executions/observations are **external** and referenced via **Evidence Bindings**; they never become parts.
* **No Method/Service as part.** Recipes and promises are **separate holons**; an episteme may **reference** them (e.g., `evaluatedBy`), not **contain** them.

> **Manager’s check.** If a box would consume energy in the real world, it’s **not** a part of your episteme; it’s a **system** out on the S→R path.

## 14 · Conformance Checklist (pattern‑level, normative)

The episteme passes the soundness checks below:

**Common Norms (apply at any declared F level, per C.2.3)**
* **CC‑UE‑01 (EP‑1 triangle).** Exactly three components {Object, Concept, Symbol}.
* **CC-UE-02 (Strict Distinction).** Carriers relate to an episteme by a **structural relation kind** `isCarriedBy` (**Constructive-grounded; not mereological _part-of_**); carriers are **never parts** of an episteme. When invoking a **structural** relation to warrant soundness, authors **SHALL** declare `validationMode=axiomatic` and cite the **Constructive** grounding (Γₘ narrative). **Epistemic** relations instead declare `validationMode ∈ {inferential, postulate}` and follow **Logical/Mapping** and/or **Empirical Validation** assurance.
* **CC‑UE‑03 (Aboutness explicit).** `about` names topic holons; scope is context‑local.
* **CC‑UE‑04 (Identity invariants).** Identity = (i) persistent root `U.Episteme` id **within its `U.BoundedContext`**, plus (ii) **role‑complete** occupancy of `{Object, Concept, Symbol}`. Slot‑cardinality changes or slot‑value swaps that alter `ClaimGraph` or `Designation & Reference Map` **MUST** mint a new `PhaseOf` edition; `Symbol` Notation‑Set/NotationBridge tweaks alone **do not**.
* **CC‑UE‑05 (Notation‑Bridge).** If multiple notations are present, register `NotationBridge(n₁,n₂)` with **CL** and loss notes; apply CL in KD‑CAL folds when traversed. 
* **CC‑UE‑06 (ReferencePlane).** Declare `ReferencePlane ∈ {world | concept | episteme}`; verification/validation obligations follow accordingly.
* **CC‑UE‑07 (Formal proof no‑decay; TA line).** Formal proof bindings do **not** decay; attach **Tool Assurance** metadata and manage its decay separately under B.3.4. 
* **CC‑UE‑08 (Episteme‑about CL).** If a claim is **about an episteme** (e.g., a review or a bridge spec), declare **`aboutEpisteme`** and apply **`CL^plane`** penalties when crossing Contexts; penalties reduce **R_eff** only; **F** invariant.
* **CC‑UE‑09 (Informal rationale auto‑debt).** `InformalRationale` MAY support *Candidate* at **low-F (≤F3)** but accrues **Epistemic Debt** and cannot alone satisfy *Effective* guards.
* **CC‑UE‑10 (Change classes).** Apply **S/M/O** classification: **S‑change** (Symbol‑only notation/bridge) ⇒ no edition; **M‑change** (ClaimGraph) ⇒ new edition; **O‑change** (Envelope/Evaluation templates/designation rules) ⇒ new edition; and **any** change that affects computed ⟨F,G,R⟩ ⇒ new edition (see §19.3 and §19.2 C2‑E6).
* **CC‑UE‑11 (Formality declaration).** Every U.Episteme MUST declare U.Formality = Fk per C.2.3; ESG guards and acceptance policies SHALL reference F thresholds instead of legacy “modes/tiers”. Formal proof bindings do not decay; Tool Assurance is managed separately under B.3.4. 
* **CC‑UE‑12 (Plug‑in layering, P‑5).** Normative semantics **MUST** be interpretable without Tooling or Pedagogy assets; mentions of notations, file types, or toolchains are **informative only**. Cross‑layer dependencies **MUST** obey **E.5.3 Unidirectional Dependency**.

**Assurance‑gated Norms**
**CC‑UE‑A0 (Aboutness surfaced).** KD‑CAL consumers MUST be able to read `about` and `ReferencePlane` directly on the episteme edition; absence of either makes the episteme non‑conformant for assurance consumption.
* **CC‑UE‑A1 (L1+).** Export **Envelope handle** and **Evaluation templates**; expose evidence slots with polarity.
* **CC‑UE‑A2 (F‑mode/L2).** Export **ClaimGraphRoot**, **JustificationGraph**, **EditionSeries**; provide decay policies for empirical bindings; compute ⟨F,G,R⟩ per B.3 skeleton. 
* **CC‑UE‑A3 (Cross‑context).** Any export used outside the Context must name **Bridge** and **CL**; KD‑CAL applies **R** penalties accordingly.
  
## 15 · Worked Examples (engineer‑manager vignettes)

**15.1 “Pump Curve Note” (operations engineering)**

* **S (Carrier):** a one‑page sheet taped to the skid.
* **M (ClaimGraph):** the note’s claim graph: *“For fluid X at 20 °C, ΔP–Q obeys curve C within ±3% up to 40 m³/h.”* Definitions point to *Q* (flow), *ΔP* (head), units.
* **R (Reference Map):** applicability: *fluid X, 15–25 °C, supply pressure 2.0–2.5 bar*; evaluation: *test rig measure Q, ΔP; accept within ±3%*.
* **Evidence Bindings:** last calibration dataset “Rig‑Apr‑12” as `MeasurementEvidenceRole (supports)`, relevance 12 months.
* **Manager’s use:** Before ramp‑up, verify evidence window is fresh and envelopes match; if not, either **refresh** or accept **epistemic debt** with a time‑boxed waiver.

**15.2 “Service Acceptance Spec” (internal service)**

* **S:** a numbered acceptance sheet at the team board.
* **M:** claims like *“Incident response: TTA ≤ 5 min (P95)”*, *“Backlog age ≤ 10 days (P90)”* with definitions.
* **R:** envelope “Prod‑Cluster‑EU; hours 08:00–20:00”; evaluation templates that read **Work** logs and compute verdicts; link to **U.Service.acceptanceSpec** by reference.
* **Evidence:** weekly observation reports `ValidationEvidenceRole (supports)`; failed weeks bind as `CounterEvidenceRole`.
* **Manager’s use:** When changing hours, update the **envelope** and spin a **new phase**; do **not** rewrite history.

**15.3 “Market Hypothesis Brief” (strategy)**

* **S:** a two‑page memo.
* **M:** claims: *“Within SME‑Segment‑A, problem P exists; solution S cuts cost by ≥ 15%.”* Definitions of *Segment‑A*, *cost*.
* **R:** envelope: *Region R, firm size 20–200, 2026–2027*; evaluation: *two pilots, predefined KPIs*.
* **Evidence:** pilot 1 result as `ModelFitEvidenceRole (supports)` with limited scope; pilot 2 as `CounterEvidenceRole`; **ClaimScope (G)** narrows to the supported niche.
* **Manager’s use:** Keep “success” local to the measured envelope; resist global roll‑up without bridges or new evidence.

---

## 16 · Authoring Cues & Heuristics (for busy leads)

* **Triangle on the card.** Fill **Object–Concept–Symbol** explicitly: where written (Symbol), what is claimed (Concept), where and how it is tested (Object).
* **Multi‑notation is allowed.** One **Symbol** may represent several notations (SBVR/LaTeX/Lean); carriers stay external via `isCarriedBy`.
* **Pin the Context.** Claim meaning is **context‑local**. Always write the `U.BoundedContext` (edition) at the top.
* **Claims come with tests or reasons.** If a claim is **axiomatic**, say so; else provide an **evaluation template**.
* **Evidence is external.** Cite *which* observation or proof supports/refutes the claim; name **polarity** and **window**.
* **Never act by paper alone.** Specs constrain; **systems** perform **Work**.

## 17 · Anti‑Patterns (and the safe rewrite)

| Anti‑pattern                              | Symptom in prose                 | Why it breaks the kernel                                  | Safe rewrite                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **“The spec enforces X.”**                | Treats a document as an actor.   | Violates A.12 (external transformer) & A.7.               | *Spec holds `RequirementRole`; a **system** performed the **Work** that enforces X.* |
| **“Our method is part of the standard.”** | Puts recipe inside episteme BoM. | Method is a separate holon; mereology error (A.14).       | *Standard **references** `MethodDescription`; it does not **contain** it.*           |
| **“Proof/data inside the claim.”**        | Blends evidence with content.    | Content vs evidence conflation; breaks KD‑CAL provenance. | *Keep claim in **ClaimGraph**; bind proof/data via **`U.EvidenceRole`**.*        |
| **“Global truth by name.”**               | Uses claim out of context.       | Breaks context locality & bridge policy.                  | *Declare a Bridge with CL & loss notes or restate the claim in the new Context.*        |
| **“One file = one truth.”**               | Equates carrier with meaning.    | Violates notational independence.                         | *Allow many carriers for one **Symbol**; editions as **PhaseOf**; meaning lives in **Concept**.* |

## 18 · Episteme State‑Change: Overview & Objects

+**Scope.** KD‑CAL treats a `U.Episteme` as (i) **structured over editions** via **`PhaseOf`** (A.14), and (ii) **governed by a *context‑local* state graph**—the **Episteme State Graph (ESG)**—with statuses such as *Draft*, *Candidate*, *Effective*, *Superseded*, *Deprecated*. ESG applies to the **episteme** itself (not to roles) and **replaces** any “lifecycle” wording. # Consistent with B.1.4 Γ_time.
**Episteme State Graph (ESG)**—which names admissible **statuses** such as *Draft*, *Candidate*, *Effective*, *Superseded*, *Deprecated*. The ESG is analogous to a Role State Graph (A.2.5) but **applies to the episteme itself** rather than to a role.

**Objects introduced (notation‑free).**

* **`Edition`** — an instantaneous **phase** of an episteme; linked by `PhaseOf(rootEpisteme)` forming a time‑ordered DAG (not a mereology tree).
* **`ESG(Context, EpistemeKind)`** — finite, **named** state set with transitions and guards **local to a `U.BoundedContext`**.
* **`StateAssertion(E, state, Window)`** — evaluation verdict that **edition E** of the episteme **is in `state`** over the **Window**, with evidence anchors.
* **`Γ_time`** — temporal fold over **edition sequences** (selection, windowing, roll‑up) used in queries, evaluation, and acceptance, conforming to **Contextual & Temporal Aggregation** (B.1.4), with explicit selectors and no implicit “latest”. For **low-F (≤F3)** `most_recent` MAY be permitted when the Context explicitly opts‑in; for **high-F (≥F7)** a selector MUST be named (e.g., `effective_at(t)`). 

 **Trajectory normative hooks**  
 *`traj_episteme(E, selector, space)`* → piecewise path of `E` in a declared **Epistemic CharacteristicSpace** (e.g., ⟨F,G,R⟩ or per‑corner coordinates) obtained by sampling editions via `Γ_time.selector` and evaluating assurance per edition.  
 *`traj_vertex(E.corner ∈ {Object,Concept,Symbol}, selector, space)`* → per‑corner trajectory (e.g., notation lineage for **Symbol**; envelope evolution for **Object**).  
 *`drift(E, metric, threshold)`* → detects change‑points on a trajectory; emits *StateAssertions* such as *Regressed/Improved/Stable*.  
 *`project(E, space)`* → current coordinate(s) (with CL penalties applied); compatible with B.3 assurance roll‑up.  // Γ_time + KD‑CAL basis. 

**Context‑local ESG.** State names and guards are **context‑local**; they **do not travel** without an explicit **Bridge** (kind, **CL**, loss notes). Out‑of‑Context ESG labels are **Inconclusive** unless bridged, and any assurance computed across the bridge carries the **CL penalty** on **R** (B.3). 

>**Why state graphs?** KD‑CAL is about **governing what is admissibly said** about knowledge **now**, not narrating “life stories”. States + guards make the **current admissibility** explicit and checkable; `PhaseOf` keeps the **edition lineage** auditable.

### **18.1 Rigor‑Aware Gating by `U.Formality` (F) and Assurance**  
**Intent.** Avoid one‑size‑fits‑all checklists. ESG/Γ\_time duties are **graded by the artifact’s declared `U.Formality` (F)** and the target Assurance Level (B.3).  
**Guards (skeleton):**  
* **G‑ESG‑1 (State set).** Contexts **SHALL** define which states are admissible **per F thresholds** (e.g., `F < 3` MAY use a minimal ESG; `F ≥ 6` MUST use the full ESG).  
* **G‑ESG‑2 (Anchors).** Guards **MUST** use observable anchors (A.10); **numeric criteria REQUIRED** whenever defined for the episteme kind.  
* **G‑ESG‑3 (Evidence).** For higher assurance (e.g., L2), guards **MUST** bind concrete evidence with freshness windows (B.3.4).  
* **G‑ESG‑4 (Proof facet).** Where a guard relies on formal proof, it **SHALL** declare `proofMode ∈ {classical | constructive | type‑theoretic}` and checker anchors `{tool, version, proof‑object‑hash}`.  
* **G‑ESG‑5 (Selectors).** All decisions **MUST** name an explicit `Γ_time` selector; no implicit “latest”.  
_Note._ F thresholds are **context‑local**; do not infer sameness across Contexts without a **Bridge** and **CL**. 

## 19 · Edition Graph (PhaseOf) — Structure & Invariants

**19.1 Structure.**
For any episteme **K**, its editions form a **DAG** with edges **`PhaseOf(K)`** and each node **Eᵢ** carrying:

* an **immutable content hash** of the carrier(s) (A.10),
* **timestamps** (`createdAt`, optional `effectiveAt`, `retiredAt`),
* **parent set** (branch/merge), and
* **Context** (context of meaning) where it is **interpreted**.

**19.2 Invariants (normative).**

* **C2‑E1 (No lifecycle).** The edition DAG is a **PhaseOf graph**; do not model it as parts or as a workflow.
* **C2‑E2 (Immutability).** Edition payloads are **immutable**; any content change yields a **new** edition node. Carrier swaps that do **not** alter the **ClaimGraph** or mappings (CL) **do not** constitute a new edition; carriers remain **external** via `isCarriedBy`. See **Γ_epist**: use `ConstituentOf/UsageOf/MemberOf`; **never** use **ComponentOf** for knowledge and keep **PhaseOf** for versions only. 
* **C2‑E3 (Merge discipline).** A **merge** produces a **new edition** with `mergedFrom = {E_a,…,E_b}`; parents remain unchanged.
* **C2‑E4 (Branch admissibility).** Multiple children of the same edition are allowed; branch semantics live in the Context (e.g., *jurisdictional variants*).
* **C2‑E5 (Context locality).** Meaning of statuses and admissibility is **scoped to a `U.BoundedContext`**; cross‑context reuse requires a **Bridge** with CL/loss notes (F.9). Γ rules and selectors referenced here remain **in‑Context**; Cross‑context queries must first rebase via the Bridge.
* **C2‑E6 (Characteristic‑aware fences).** Any change that alters computed ⟨F,G,R⟩ for any declared claim MUST mint a new edition (PhaseOf), regardless of carrier/notation changes. S/M/O classes apply as defined; Symbol‑only tweaks that do not alter ClaimGraph or Reference Map do not mint a new edition.
  
** 19.3 Change classes (normative) — S/M/O**
* ***S‑change (Symbol).** Changes limited to the `Symbol` component’s **Notation‑Set** or to `NotationBridge` metadata **without** changing the `ClaimGraph` or the `Designation & Reference Map` ⇒ **no new edition**.
* ***M‑change (Concept).** Any change to the `ClaimGraph` (add/remove/alter claims, definitions, or entailment structure) ⇒ **new edition (PhaseOf)**.
* ***O‑change (Object).** Any change to the `Designation & Reference Map`—envelope narrowing/widening, method/evaluation‑template swap, or designation‑rule edits ⇒ **new edition (PhaseOf)**.
* ***F/G/R trigger (superseding rule).** Regardless of the S/M/O label, any change that alters computed ⟨F,G,R⟩ for any declared claim ⇒ **new edition (PhaseOf)** (§19.2 C2‑E6).

## 20 · ESG (Episteme State Graph) — States, Guards, Assertions

**20.1 ESG definition (by Context, episteme kind).**
`ESG(Context, EpistemeKind) = ⟨States S, Enactable S_en=∅, Transitions T, Guards⟩`
*Note.* Episteme states are **status‑only** (not enactable Work); **`S_en = ∅`** by design. They **gate decisions** (e.g., can be cited as binding) but cannot “perform Work.”

**20.2 Typical ESG (templates to specialise per Context).**

* **NormativeStandard ESG:** *Draft → Candidate → Effective → Superseded → Deprecated*.
* **Dataset ESG:** *Collected → Verified → Validated → Obsolete* (+ *Contested* side branch).
* **Model ESG:** *Trained → Evaluated → Accepted → Retired* (guards reference evaluation protocols).
 
  **Guards MUST be observable** (A.10) and **time‑windowed** per **Evidence Decay** (B.3.4); stale assertions expire and **MUST NOT** silently persist.  **Formality-aware gating** from §18.1 applies.
 
**20.3 StateAssertions.**
A **StateAssertion(E, s, W)** holds when the **checklist** for **state `s`** is proven from observable facts (A.10: SCR/RSCR anchors) within **Window `W`**. Assertions **expire** with their windows; no silent perpetuity. Selectors **MUST** be explicit (e.g., `effective_at(t)`, `windowed(W, policy)`) and are interpreted by **Γ_time** (B.1.4). 

**Proof‑mode declaration (guard facet).** When a state is gated **via formal proof**, the assertion **MUST** declare `proofMode ∈ {classical, constructive, type‑theoretic}` and cite `{tool, version, proof‑object‑hash}` where applicable. _(This facet is independent of F; F is defined by C.2.3.)_

**Constructive acceptance (optional, F‑mode).** For `proofMode ∈ {constructive, type‑theoretic}`, a **proof‑object** (e.g., Lean/Agda) MAY serve as the observable for the guard if its checker run is recorded as `U.Work` and anchored (A.10); such assertions **do not decay**, but **toolchain trust** is accounted for via TA in B.3.

**20.4 Guards (examples).**

* **Admission:** “ratification speech‑act exists within 90 days” (for *Effective*).
* **Cross‑context admissibility:** If a consumer is in a different `U.BoundedContext`, a **Bridge** with declared kind and **CL ≥ threshold** **MUST** exist; otherwise the consumer’s status is **Inconclusive** (advisory to B.3). 
+ * **Freshness:** For empirical states (e.g., *Validated*), at least one supporting **EvidenceBinding** **MUST** be within its relevance window (B.3.4). 

* **Maintenance:** “no newer conflicting Effective edition in the same Context scope.”
* **Exit:** “superseding edition E′ exists & is Effective.”
* **Low-F minimal guard:** For *Candidate*, **low-F (≤F3)** MAY accept a qualitative rationale plus at least one `EvidenceBinding` stub; for **high-F (≥F7)**, quantitative thresholds and binding windows are REQUIRED.

* **Formal‑proof guard (F‑mode).** States satisfied via formal proof MUST declare `ProofKernel`, checker `{tool,version}`, and proof‑object hash; **no decay** on the binding; **TA** tracked separately. 
* **ReferencePlane guard.** For `external`, at least one empirical `EvidenceBinding` within its relevance window is required for *Validated/Effective*; for `coincident`, verification suffices.
 
**20.5 Invariants.**

* **C2‑S1 (Observable).** Checklists and guards must be **observable** (Observation, Work, SpeechAct, or derived Evaluation).
* **C2‑S2 (Windowed).** Every assertion is **Window‑bound**; stale assertions **MUST** be renewed or explicitly waived.
* **C2‑S3 (No role leakage).** ESG is **not** a RoleStateGraph; keep role readiness (A.2.5) separate from episteme status.
* **C2-S4 (Formality-aware gating).** ESG obligations are **filtered** by §18.1. **High-F (≥F7) / L2** MUST satisfy the full guard set; **Low-F (≤F3) / L0–L1** MAY satisfy the minimal set but MUST NOT claim states whose guards they did not meet.

## 21 · Branch & Merge Semantics (No Conflation)

**21.1 Branch kinds (illustrative).**

* **Applicability branch** (*same claim, different scope*): e.g., Standard v2 for **EU**, Standard v2 for **US**.
* **Methodological branch** (*different derivation, same intent*): two independent replications of a dataset.
* **Policy branch** (*different acceptance thresholds*): safety case for *SC2* vs *SC3*.

**21.2 Merge policy.**
Merging **never edits parents**; it **creates** a new edition with explicit `mergedFrom` and an **Evaluation** that states how conflicts were resolved (e.g., *prefer higher AssuranceLevel; tie‑break by recency*). For any merged claim, compute provisional **R_eff** under **WLNK** with **congruence penalty** `Φ(CL_min(path))` including **NotationBridge**/**aboutEpisteme** CLs where traversed. 

**21.3 Safety rule.**
* **C2‑BM1 (No silent merge).** Any merge **MUST** cite the **policy episteme** (how to reconcile) and record **loss notes** including **effective CL** over used Bridges (min over edges). 
* **C2‑BM2 (Scope monotonicity).** A merge must **not** silently widen the **ClaimScope**; widening requires an explicit Context decision.
* **C2‑BM3 (Assurance floor).** Parents participating in a **normative** merge MUST have at least **AssuranceLevel L1**. If the merged edition is intended to be **Effective**, the merge MUST satisfy **declared F-thresholds per §18.1** (e.g., F≥4 for constraint-style guards; F≥7 for machine-checked proofs) and recompute ⟨F,G,R⟩

## 22 · Temporal Composition with Γ\_time

**22.1 Purpose.**
`Γ_time` gives **time‑aware selection/folding** over edition streams: **which** edition is **effective** for a given query window and policy.

**22.2 Canonical selectors (context‑local).**

* **`effective_at(t)`** → the unique edition **E** with StateAssertion *(Effective, W)* s.t. *t ∈ W*.
* **`latest_effective_before(t)`** → last effective E before *t*.
* **`windowed(W, policy)`** → set of editions effective within **W**, folded per **policy**.

**22.3 Folding policies (examples; all **IDEM/MONO/WLNK**‑safe per B.1):**

* **`max_assurance`** — choose the edition with maximal ⟨F,G,R⟩ (B.3).
* **`most_recent`** — pick the most recent **Effective**.
* **`conservative_intersection`** — intersect claim‑scopes across effective editions (weakest‑link).
* **`approval_lineage(Authority)`** — select editions approved by a named authority.
**Cross‑context discipline.** Selectors operate **in‑Context**; Cross‑context selection requires a prior **Bridge** and communicates the **CL penalty** alongside results (advisory to B.3 roll‑ups). 

**22.4 Invariants.**

* **C2‑T1 (Selector explicitness).** Every temporal query **MUST** name its **selector** (no implicit “latest”).
* **C2‑T2 (Closed‑world within Context).** `Γ_time` operates **within** one `U.BoundedContext`; Cross‑context folds require a **Bridge** that explicitly states CL and losses.
* **C2-T3 (Formality-graded defaults).** For **low-F (≤F3)** content a context MAY allow `most_recent` in pedagogy/exploration; for **high-F (≥F7)** content a selector **MUST** be declared (e.g., `effective_at(t)` or `max_assurance`) per use case.

## 23 · Interaction: ESG × Evidence × Services

**23.1 Evidence binding.**
An episteme **edition** can wear **`U.EvidenceRole`** (A.2.4) in a Context (e.g., “this dataset **supports** claim C for population P over Window W”). ESG governs **admissibility** (e.g., only *Validated* datasets may be bound as evidence). Evidence **MUST** anchor to **external `U.Work`**; knowledge does **not** “evidence itself” (A.15; B.3.2). Empirical bindings carry **relevance windows** (B.3.4). 
 
* **23.2 Formal/constructive proofs as evidence (F≥7).** A formal proof checked by a tool (e.g., Lean/Coq/Agda) **MAY** serve as `verifiedBy` evidence **provided** the checker run is recorded as `U.Work` and the `{tool, version, proof‑object‑hash}` are captured. For **constructive/type‑theoretic** proofs, authors MUST declare `proofMode = constructive|type‑theoretic`; **no decay** applies to such bindings, but **typing/toolchain assurance (TA)** remains in scope (B.3).

**23.3 Service evaluation as episteme.**
Service KPIs are computed from **`U.Work`** (design/run split), then captured as a **report episteme edition**. Its ESG (**e.g.,** *Published → Audited → Accepted*) gates whether the report may be used in **policy** or **assurance** decisions; do **not** attach “actuals” to the Service itself. (A.15; B.3). 

**23.4 Role‑gated decisions.**
Method steps that **require** a knowledge status (e.g., “use **Effective** Standard”) must reference **ESG states** explicitly. At run‑time, validators check `StateAssertion(edition, Effective, W)` via `Γ_time.effective_at(now)`.

## 24 · Conformance Checklist (additions)

> **IDs continue from earlier KD‑CAL CC items; here we add CC‑C2‑12 … CC‑C2‑19.**

* **CC‑C2‑12 (Edition graph not mereology).** `PhaseOf` **MUST** be used for editions; editions **MUST NOT** appear as parts in any `partOf` tree (A.14 guard).
* **CC‑C2‑13 (Immutability).** An edition’s content hash **MUST NOT** change; any change yields a **new** edition node.
* **CC‑C2‑14 (ESG locality).** ESG definitions are **per Context** and **per episteme kind**; labels like “Effective” **do not travel** across contexts without a Bridge.
* **CC‑C2‑15 (Observable ESG).** Every ESG state **MUST** have a checklist of observable criteria; StateAssertions **MUST** cite evidence carriers (A.10).
* **CC‑C2‑16 (Temporal selector required).** Any consumption of an episteme “now” **MUST** declare a `Γ_time` selector (e.g., `effective_at(now)`).
* **CC‑C2‑17 (Merge provenance).** A merge edition **MUST** carry `mergedFrom`, cite the **reconciliation policy episteme**, and record **effective CL** for all Bridges used; silent merges are non‑conformant. 
* **CC‑C2‑18 (Scope monotonicity).** A merge **MUST NOT** broaden claim‑scope unless the Context grants it via a **SpeechAct** or policy record.
* **CC‑C2‑19 (No lifecycle wording).** Core narrative and metadata **SHALL** avoid “lifecycle”; authors **MUST** use “state‑change / ESG / PhaseOf / Γ\_time” wording.
* * **CC‑C2‑20 (Evidence freshness).** Any empirical **EvidenceBinding** used to justify an ESG state or an acceptance verdict **MUST** be within its declared relevance window (B.3.4). 
* **CC‑C2‑21 (Selector explicitness).** Every consumer that reads or enforces an ESG state **MUST** name its `Γ_time` selector; implicit “latest” is non‑conformant (B.1.4). 
* **CC‑C2‑22 (Design/run hygiene).** Service acceptance and run‑time KPIs **MUST** be computed from **`U.Work`**; Services carry **acceptance specs** only; no “actuals” attached to the Service (A.15; B.3). 
* **CC‑C2‑23 (Trajectory API).** If trajectories are used for governance, the context MUST publish the `selector`, the `space`, and the `drift` metric; implicit “latest” trajectories are non‑conformant.

## 25 · Worked Examples (engineer–manager thinking)

**25.A Standard (regulatory).**
*Goal.* Always apply the right edition of **Brake‑Test Standard** during runs in 2026.

* **ESG (Standards):** *Draft → Candidate → Effective → Superseded*.
* **Quarterly runs use selector**: `effective_at(run.startTime)`; dashboards surface the **specific edition id** and **Bridge CL** if a Cross‑context mapping was required. 
* **Change management:** when v2026‑06 becomes *Effective*, no code changes are needed: validators select the correct **edition** by time, and dashboards show **which edition** governed each run.

**25.B Dataset (analytics).**
*Goal.* Use only **Validated** datasets younger than 12 months.

* **ESG (Datasets):** *Collected → Verified → Validated → Obsolete*.
* **Guard:** `Validated` requires two independent replications (evidence bindings to two external `U.Work` sets).
* **Selector:** `latest_effective_before(now)` with additional freshness guard on `StateAssertion` window (B.3.4).
* **Assurance note:** When combining replications across labs, compute **R_eff** with **WLNK** and apply `Φ(CL_min)` from the weakest mapping used.
* **Manager’s cue:** “Badge + bounds”: insist on the ESG state (*Validated*) **and** the freshness window.

**25.C Knowledge merge (jurisdictions).**
*Goal.* Publish a **Merged‑Tax** episteme combining **EU** and **US** tax interpretations.

* **Merge:** create `Merged‑Tax‑2026.01` with `mergedFrom={EU‑2025.12, US‑2025.11}` and an **Evaluation** that records **effective CL** and **loss notes** for each mapping. Consumers outside either Context **must** traverse the **Bridge** before applying selectors. 
* **Policy episteme:** “Prefer stricter clause when conflicts” (cited in the edition metadata).
* **Bridge notes:** Cross‑context mapping documented with **CL=2** (minor loss: differing carve‑outs).
* **Auditability:** every consumer can see **exact parents** and **policy** used.

### 26 · Regression Harness (what to re‑check on changes)

* **RH‑E1 (ESG change).** When ESG states/guards change, re‑evaluate all open **StateAssertions**; mark those that lapse and schedule renewals.
* **RH‑E2 (Selector semantics).** If a selector policy is revised (e.g., from `most_recent` to `max_assurance`), re‑run acceptance checks that depended on the old policy and record deltas.
* **RH‑E3 (Branching).** On adding a new branch, verify **no “default” selector** accidentally swallows it; require consumers to pick a branch or use an approved merge.
* **RH‑E4 (Bridge drift).** If a Bridge’s CL/loss notes change, recompute **assurance penalties** for all decisions that traversed the bridge.
* **RH‑E5 (No lifecycle creep).** Lint the text: block “life‑cycle”/“LC” tokens; suggest “state‑change”/ESG/PhaseOf/Γ\_time rewrites.

### 27 Manager’s pocket summary 

* **Don’t say “lifecycle”.** Think **edition DAG (PhaseOf)** + **status gates (ESG)** + **time selector (`Γ_time`)**.
* **Always name the selector.** Never rely on “the latest”; say `effective_at(t)` or the policy you use.
* **Merges create, they don’t mutate.** A merge produces a **new edition** with a named policy; parents stay intact.
* **States gate decisions.** Only ESG states like *Effective*/*Validated* make an edition admissible for use; assertions are **windowed** and **evidence‑anchored**.
* **Keep it local.** Meanings live **in the Context** (Context); to reuse across Contexts, build a **Bridge** and accept its CL penalty.

##  28 · Conformance Checklist (CC‑KD.\*)

> *All clauses are normative in the Core; any reference to tools, formats, or pipelines belongs to the Tooling Reference, not here.*

**CC‑KD‑01 — Episteme as holon; action externalization.**
Every `U.Episteme` **is a holon** with a boundary and internal parts (axioms/claims/datasets/arguments). **All actions that change an episteme occur via systems** bearing behavioral roles operating on **carriers** of that episteme; **no self‑evidence and no self‑editing** by the episteme itself (A.7, A.12, A.15).

**CC‑KD‑02 — Episteme State Graph (ESG) replaces “lifecycle”.**
KD‑CAL **forbids** the term *lifecycle* for epistemes. A context **MUST** define an **Episteme State‑Change Graph (ESG)** — a finite, named set of states and guarded transitions (e.g., *Draft → Reviewed → Adopted → Superseded/Deprecated*). ESG nodes **may** be status‑only; they **never** authorize `U.Work` by themselves.

**CC‑KD‑03 — Edition, branch, merge = PhaseOf + Γ\_time.**
KD editioning **MUST** use `PhaseOf` (A.14) for **editions** and **Γ\_time** events for **branches/merges**. A merge **MUST** preserve the **EPV‑DAG** of both parents; loss requires an explicit *LossNote* in the receiving context (B.1.4; A.10).

**CC‑KD‑04 — Provenance minimum (EPV‑DAG).**
Every normative KD claim **MUST** be reachable from at least one **evidence‑bearing episteme** via an **Evidence–Provenance DAG** edge set: `claims ⟵ evidencedBy ⟵ carriers ⟵ producedBy(Work)`; cycles that make a claim **its own unique support** are **forbidden** (A.10).

**CC‑KD‑05 — Assurance triad F–G–R with Congruence penalty.**
When KD evidence rolls up, **Formality (F)**, **ClaimScope (G)**, and **Reliability (R)** are computed per B.3 with **weakest‑link** semantics along each dependency path and a **Congruence penalty** for cross‑context steps. If any leg is *postulative*, the leg’s mode is *postulative*.

**CC‑KD‑06 — Evidence decay & debt.**
Empirical evidence **MUST** declare a relevance window; on expiry it accrues **Epistemic Debt** and **MUST** be routed through one of: *Refresh*, *Deprecate*, *Waive (with SpeechAct & rationale)* (B.3.4).

**CC‑KD‑07 — Context locality and Bridges.**
Meanings of KD roles, state names, and acceptance criteria are **local to a `U.BoundedContext`**. Cross‑context reuse **MUST** use an explicit **Bridge** with a **Congruence Level (CL)** and **loss notes** (F.9). Label equality **never** implies meaning equality.

**CC‑KD‑08 — Design‑run split for KD operations.**
Design‑time KD assets are **`U.Episteme`** and **`U.MethodDescription`**; run‑time assets are **`U.Work`** and **`U.Observation`**. It is **non‑conformant** to mutate an episteme inside a `U.Work` record or to treat a run log as a design‑time edition (A.4, A.15).

**CC‑KD‑09 — Role hygiene for KD.**
Behavioral roles (Transformer/Observer/Speech) **bind to systems**; KD status roles (e.g., `U.EvidenceRole`, `NormativeStandardRole`) **bind to epistemes** and are **status‑only**; they never enact `U.Work` (A.2, A.2.4, A.2.5).

**CC‑KD‑10 — Γ\_epist operators are conservative.**
`Γ_epist` **MUST** be *conservative*: (i) for trust it uses **min/weakest‑link** per dependency path; (ii) for scope it **intersects** claim scopes; (iii) for counts it prohibits double‑counting across *aliases* unless a Bridge declares equivalence with CL≥2 and a counting policy.

**CC‑KD‑11 — Acceptance is a test over Work, not over Service.**
Acceptance verdicts for KD claims and services **MUST** be computed from **Work** facts, against **acceptance specs** carried by epistemes (A.2.3). Services carry no “actuals”.

**CC‑KD‑12 — Units, envelopes, and windows.**
Measures used in KD reasoning **MUST** name units, envelopes, and windows; *percentages* **MUST** be anchored to a PortionOf measure (A.14; B.1.3).

**CC‑KD‑13 — UTS registration.**
All KD exports (types, relations, operators) **MUST** be registered into the **Unified Term Sheet** for their architheory thread, with twin labels (tech/plain) and scope notes (F.17).

**CC‑KD‑14 — Notational independence.**
Any normative KD rule **MUST** be readable without binding to OWL, PROV‑O, BPMN, Lean, or SQL. Examples may appear in Pedagogy, not in the Core (E.5.2).

**CC‑KD‑15 — Guard‑rails.**
Narratives **MUST** respect DevOps Lexical Firewall, Unidirectional Dependency, and Cross‑disciplinary Bias Audit (E.5.\*): no CI/CD jargon in the Core and no back‑edges from tools to norms.

## 29 · Regression Suite (RSCR‑KD.\*) — *what to re‑check when KD assets evolve*

> *Use this mental diff when you change ESGs, Bridges, weights, or Γ policies.*

**RSCR‑KD‑01 — ESG churn.**
On adding/renaming/removing a **state** in an Episteme ESG, re‑evaluate: (i) gating policies that reference that state; (ii) all Bridges that map this state across contexts; (iii) any “status‑only” invariant.

**RSCR‑KD‑02 — Merge integrity.**
After a merge event (Γ\_time), verify that **all provenance paths** from both parents are preserved or explicitly loss‑noted; recompute **R\_eff** on affected claims.

**RSCR‑KD‑03 — Bridge drift.**
If any side of a Bridge changes checklists or state criteria, **do not carry CL forward by default**. Re‑score CL with a one‑line rationale and capture **lost/added** RCS characteristics.

**RSCR‑KD‑04 — Weight model change.**
When the context changes the KD weight model, snapshot the former model; re‑compute scores for a sample to detect discontinuities; publish migration guidance.

**RSCR‑KD‑05 — Decay thresholds.**
If evidence freshness windows change, flag all bindings now past threshold; trigger *Refresh/Deprecate/Waive* workflow.

**RSCR‑KD‑06 — Γ policy edits.**
Any change to Γ\_epist fold functions or counting rules requires: (i) monotonicity proof sketch; (ii) re‑run of trust roll‑ups on a representative slate; (iii) note of KPI impacts.

**RSCR‑KD‑07 — UTS/alias stability.**
Name edits **MUST** keep identity stable (aliases), unless semantics changed materially; if semantics changed, mint a **new export** and update UTS rows.

## 30 · Consequences

| Benefit                                   | Why it matters                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No “magical documents.”**               | Epistemes don’t act; systems do. Category errors vanish and audits are reproducible.               |
| **Evolution without amnesia.**            | ESG + PhaseOf + Γ\_time let knowledge change indefinitely without rewriting history or provenance. |
| **Trust that composes conservatively.**   | Min/weakest‑link + CL penalties prevent optimism bias in roll‑ups.                                 |
| **Context‑pluralism with explicit loss.** | Bridges carry CL + loss notes; Cross‑context reuse is honest and reviewable.                          |
| **Clean separation of promise vs proof.** | Services are promises; **Work** is proof; KD ties them with acceptance specs and evidence anchors. |

**Trade‑offs.** Authors must define ESGs and loss notes and keep Bridges current. This adds visible ceremony; it pays back in fewer invisible errors.

## 31 · Rationale (cross‑domain fit, 2016 → now)

Post‑2015 practice converges on **explicit provenance**, **externalized action**, and **conservative integration** of evidence. KD‑CAL codifies those as first principles and binds them to Core invariants (A.7/A.12/A.14/A.15) and Γ‑algebra (B.1). The Part E authoring discipline guarantees didactic readability while keeping implementation details out of the Canon.

* **Say “state‑change,” not “lifecycle.”** Publish the **ESG** in the role/episteme’s **RoleDescription**/**EpistemeCard**.
* **Badge + bounds.** Gate critical steps using **badge (RoleAssignment)** + **bounds (WorkScope)**; judge services from **Work**.
* **Weakest‑link first.** Trust folds downhill; if you must average, you are in Pedagogy, not in Core.
* **local contexts, explicit bridges.** Names don’t travel without a **Bridge (CL + losses)**.
* **No self‑evidence.** Every KD binding points to **external Work**.
* **Register in UTS.** Every KD export gets a UTS row with twin labels.

* **CL^plane** uses the penalty function described in the row above; wire it into the existing CL pipeline (no change to CL levels, only an adjustment term).
* **NotationBridge** adopts the existing **CL=3..0** lattice and the *Waiver SpeechAct* path for CL=1 substitutions.
* **Naming discipline:** keep **tech/plain twin labels** as shown; “aka `traj.reach`” is an allowed alias in the *tech* register within the same context.
* **Didactic flags:** `U.InformalRationale` instances must open a **refresh task** in your DRR index until replaced or supported by a formal episteme carrying an EvidenceRole.

## 37 · Didactic distillation (60 s)

> *KD‑CAL makes knowledge **changeable** without losing **truth trails**. Epistemes move by a **State‑Change Graph**; editions/branches/merges are **PhaseOf + Γ\_time**. Evidence is a **status** of an episteme, never an action. Trust rolls up by **weakest‑link** with **CL penalties** on Bridges. Services promise; **Work** proves; acceptance is a test over Work. Keep everything local to a **Context of meaning** and register exports in **UTS**.*

> **One‑line summary.** Defines **Formality (F)** as a single, ordinal **Characteristic** (`U.Formality`) with **polarity “up”**, anchored by a **default ladder F0…F9** from **free prose** to **proof‑grade foundations**. This unifies how rigor is declared and compared across all epistemes and contexts, and supplies the **F‑coordinate** in the F–G–R assurance space.

### 0 · Status & Scope

**Status.** Normative pattern in **KD‑CAL / Part C.2**. It **replaces** the legacy “modes/tiers” language and any parallel “formality ladders.” The letter **F** hereafter denotes the **Formality** characteristic in the **F–G–R** triple.

**Scope.** Conceptual only. The pattern **does not** prescribe workflows, toolchains, or team procedures. It specifies *what Formality is and how to measure/declare it*, so that any team, discipline, or architheory can think and communicate rigor with the same yardstick.

**Non‑goals.**
– Not a publication process, not a governance gate.
– Not a reliability metric (R) and not a scope/abstraction metric (G).
– Not tied to any notation, repository layout, or CI/CD practice.

## 1 · Context

Transdisciplinary work (physics, software, systems, policy, data) needs a **shared notion of rigor** that travels across context of meaning. A controller invariant stated in a theorem prover, a research hypothesis framed in constrained English, and a managerial decision rule written as acceptance criteria must be **comparable**—not by their domain lore, but by **how strictly they are expressed**.

Historically, FPF texts carried **multiple signals of rigor** (narrative “modes,” editorial tiers, ad‑hoc “formal vs. informal” talk). These signals mixed with status labels (e.g., “Draft/Effective”), obscuring whether an “approved” artifact was **actually precise** or merely **organizationally accepted**. To reason soundly in KD‑CAL and to compose artifacts safely, we standardize a **single Formality characteristic F**:

* **Portable:** works for math, code, models, requirements, policies.
* **Ordinal & minimal:** few clear anchors from “sketch” to “foundations.”
* **Composable:** participates in the F–G–R calculus and weak‑link invariants.
* **Context‑extensible:** Contexts may introduce **intermediate anchors** without breaking comparability.

---

## 2 · Problem

Absent a unified **F**:

1. **Rigor whiplash.** Either everything is forced into premature formalism (blocking exploration), or informal artifacts drift into high‑assurance use (creating silent risks).
2. **Incomparability.** Each Context’s labels mean different things. Reviewers, integrators, and auditors cannot align expectations or compute trustworthy composites.
3. **Lost continuity.** Moving from sketch to proof often becomes a **rewrite**, severing provenance; the same idea looks like different artifacts at each “mode,” inviting translation errors.
4. **Confused roles.** Status (e.g., “accepted here”) gets conflated with rigor (“precise enough”), undermining governance and the KD‑CAL trust math.

## 3 · Forces

| Force                                             | Tension to resolve                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Human ↔ Formal system**                         | Natural language is fast and legible; formal systems are unambiguous and checkable. We need a spectrum, not a cliff.                           |
| **Local freedom ↔ Global comparability**          | Contexts must be free to set thresholds; cross‑context reasoning requires a shared scale and anchors.                                          |
| **Readability ↔ Precision**                       | Rich narrative aids understanding; tight syntax prevents misinterpretation. The characteristic must not force one at the expense of the other. |
| **Open‑world thinking ↔ Closed‑world guarantees** | Exploration benefits from openness; certification needs explicit closure. F must support gradual “closing” without renaming the artifact.      |

## 4 · Solution — The **Formality Characteristic F**

### 4.1 · Identity and Type (MM‑CHR)

* **Name:** `U.Formality` (nicknamed **F** in F–G–R).
* **Type:** `U.Characteristic`.
* **Scale:** **ordinal** (no arithmetic; comparisons and thresholds only).
* **Polarity:** **up** (higher ⇒ more strictly and unambiguously expressed).
* **Unit:** **formality step** (qualitative anchor).
* **Value domain:** default anchors **F0…F9** (see §4.4).
* **Carrier:** any `U.Episteme` (claim/theory/spec/model/policy/etc.).
* **Notation‑agnostic:** the same F semantics apply regardless of symbol system; bridges between notations do **not** change F (they may affect R via CL, see C.2.2).

**Normative reading.** “F = k” states *how strictly the content is expressed*, not whether it is true (R) nor how broadly it applies (G).

---

### 4.2 · Relationship to KD‑CAL (F–G–R)

* **F in the triple.** F is the **Formality coordinate** in the F–G–R assurance space. It influences trust **indirectly**: higher F reduces ambiguity, enabling stronger evidence and safer composition, but **does not** substitute for evidence (R) or scope (G).
* **Composition invariant (weakest‑link).** For any composite episteme,
  **F\_composite = min(F\_parts on support paths)**.
  *Rationale:* the formal rigor of a whole cannot exceed its least‑formal essential part.
* **Orthogonality.** Changing **G** (envelope/scope) or **R** (evidence) does not, by itself, change **F**; conversely, raising **F** does not imply broader G or higher R.

---

### 4.3 · Extensibility and Local Anchors

FPF provides **default anchors F0…F9** (next subsection). **Contexts MAY**:

* introduce **intermediate anchors** (e.g., F6.5) or **named sub‑anchors** (e.g., “F4‑OCL” vs “F4‑TLA‑constraints”),
* publish **domain exemplars** for anchors,
* define **thresholds** (e.g., “claims of type X must be F≥7”).

**Constraints (normative):**

* **Monotonic order is preserved.** New anchors **MUST NOT** invert or blur the ordering.
* **Anchor meaning is conserved.** Local elaborations **SHALL** map to the nearest global anchor without shifting global semantics (e.g., anything called “F8.x” remains **proof‑grade**).
* **No proxy scales.** Do **not** invent alternative “formality modes/tiers” as surrogates; use **F** explicitly.

---

### 4.4 · Default **F0…F9** Anchors (overview)

> *Full anchor definitions with cross‑disciplinary examples appear in §5 (next part). Below is the overview for orientation.*

* **F0 — Unstructured prose.** Free narrative; ambiguous; human interpretation only.
* **F1 — Scoped notes.** Informal but term‑consistent scope; clearer than F0.
* **F2 — Structured outline.** Template present; coherent sections; criteria mostly “TBD”.
* **F3 — Controlled narrative.** Complete template; constraints sketched in constrained NL or pseudo‑formal phrasing.
* **F4 — First‑order constraints.** Explicit invariants/properties expressible at ≈FOL level (checkable conditions exist).
* **F5 — Executable math/algorithmics.** Precisely defined computational semantics; outcomes checkable by execution/simulation.
* **F6 — Hybrid formalism.** Mixed discrete/continuous methods; model‑checking or equivalent obligations identified.
* **F7 — Higher‑order verified.** Core claims encoded and checked in HOL‑style systems.
* **F8 — Dependent/constructive proofs.** Proof‑carrying content (programs‑as‑proofs).
* **F9 — Univalent/higher foundations.** Equality‑as‑structure; frontier‑grade formal foundations.

**Intent of anchors.** They form a **gentle gradient** from “thinker‑friendly” (F0–F3) through “formalizable” (F4–F6) to **proof‑grade** (F7–F9), allowing the **same artifact** to climb without renaming or forking.

---

### 4.5 · Usage Obligations (declaration, not governance)

* **Declare F.** Every normative episteme **SHALL** declare its **F** (one value) in its context. There is **no default**.
* **Use F in reasoning.** Any comparison, composition, or alignment that depends on rigor **SHOULD** reference **F** explicitly rather than implicit labels like “draft/final.”
* **Do not conflate F with status.** Status systems (ESG/RSG) may **refer** to F in their guards, but **F ≠ status**. This pattern defines **what** rigor is, not **when** a Context should require it.

---

## 5 · Canonical Anchors **F0…F9** (normative)

> **How to read this section.** Each anchor defines *what is minimally true* of an episteme to be rated at that level — across disciplines. The anchors are **ordinal**: F7 is strictly more formal than F6, etc. Levels are **about expression**, not truth; Reliability (R) and ClaimScope (G) are separate.

For every anchor we state **Definition**, **Inclusion criteria**, **Non‑examples** (to prevent over‑rating), and **Indicative artifacts** (cross‑disciplinary, post‑2015).

---

### 5.1 · **F0 — Unstructured Prose**

**Definition.** Free natural language; ambiguous; unstated assumptions; no required sections; meaning depends on reader context.
**Inclusion criteria.** Narrative exists but lacks stable structure; terms may shift meaning; no explicit acceptance/denial conditions.
**Non‑examples.** Any document with a consistent outline and stable vocabulary is at least F1.
**Indicative artifacts.** Whiteboard photos; impromptu email threads; notes from a hallway discussion; an ad‑hoc wiki page with mixed jargon.

---

### 5.2 · **F1 — Scoped Notes**

**Definition.** Informal narrative with a **consistent scope** and **stable terms**; some headings; the central claim/problem is bounded.
**Inclusion criteria.** Key terms are used consistently; scope is named (e.g., “for single‑node scheduling”); still no explicit criteria.
**Non‑examples.** If each requirement already names a check or scenario, that is F2+.
**Indicative artifacts.** A design note that consistently uses the same nouns/verbs and states “this applies to v2 of the service”; a lab memo defining a focus population.

---

### 5.3 · **F2 — Structured Outline**

**Definition.** A **complete template** (Context/Problem/Forces/Solution/…) is populated; content is coherent end‑to‑end; criteria are mostly placeholders.
**Inclusion criteria.** All expected sections exist; cross‑references are consistent; open items are marked (e.g., “TBD acceptance”).
**Non‑examples.** If acceptance criteria are explicit per claim, that is F3+.
**Indicative artifacts.** A draft pattern/spec with fully populated sections but qualitative language; an experiment plan with all slots filled yet non‑operational metrics.

---

### 5.4 · **F3 — Controlled Narrative**

**Definition.** Narrative remains human‑readable but uses **constrained phrasing**; each claim has a **clear, singular interpretation**.
**Inclusion criteria.** Use of controlled NL or disciplined templates (e.g., “shall/if/then”); per‑claim **acceptance statements** exist in prose.
**Non‑examples.** If properties are encoded as logical constraints or typeable contracts, that is F4+.
**Indicative artifacts.** Requirements written in Attempto‑style controlled English; decision rules with explicit pre‑/post‑conditions phrased in a fixed schema.

---

### 5.5 · **F4 — First‑Order Constraints**

**Definition.** Key claims are expressible at **≈ first‑order logic** (FOL) granularity; invariants/constraints are **explicit and checkable in principle**.
**Inclusion criteria.** Each critical statement can be rendered as a predicate over well‑typed variables; conflict/consistency checks are conceivable.
**Non‑examples.** Bare unit tests or executable code without stated invariants is not automatically F4.
**Indicative artifacts.** TLA+ or OCL constraints on a model; an API spec where pre/postconditions and invariants are written as logic‑like rules; well‑typed schema constraints with quantification over entities.

---

### 5.6 · **F5 — Executable Math / Algorithmics**

**Definition.** Content has **precise execution semantics**; results can be checked by **running** (simulation or computation).
**Inclusion criteria.** A model is encoded so that outcomes are deterministic (modulo declared randomness); simulations/tests demonstrate the claims’ executable shape.
**Non‑examples.** “It runs” without a statement of what is guaranteed is not enough; opaque notebooks with side effects but no declared semantics stay F3–F4.
**Indicative artifacts.** Differential‑equation models in code; a reference implementation with clear contract comments linked to tests; an ML training recipe where the algorithmic pipeline and metrics are fully explicit (yet not proven).

---

### 5.7 · **F6 — Hybrid Formalism**

**Definition.** Combination of **discrete and continuous** reasoning or multiple formal layers; **model‑checking obligations** or equivalent are identified and traceable.
**Inclusion criteria.** Hybrid claims (e.g., controller + plant) are spelled out with both sides’ formalisms and the glue; property checks are specified.
**Non‑examples.** A prose description of cyber‑physical behavior without model obligations is ≤F5.
**Indicative artifacts.** Safety envelopes for autonomous motion expressed as state‑space invariants plus controller logic; hybrid automata with stated safety properties; contracts linking simulation to discrete decisions.

---

### 5.8 · **F7 — Higher‑Order Verified**

**Definition.** Core claims are encoded in a **higher‑order logic (HOL)** or equivalent, and **machine‑checked**; proof scripts or structured proofs exist.
**Inclusion criteria.** The kernel/tool verifies each inference step; failing changes break proofs.
**Non‑examples.** A hand proof attached to F4 constraints without machine checking remains F4–F5.
**Indicative artifacts.** A theorem in Isabelle/HOL or HOL‑Light proving a protocol invariant; a verified algebraic property of a cryptographic scheme.

---

### 5.9 · **F8 — Dependent / Constructive Proofs**

**Definition.** **Programs‑as‑proofs** (Curry–Howard) or **dependent type** artifacts; proof terms are part of the artifact; compilation/type‑check is verification.
**Inclusion criteria.** Types capture the property; changing the property changes the type and breaks the build.
**Non‑examples.** A typed program whose types do not encode the critical property is ≤F5.
**Indicative artifacts.** A Coq/Lean implementation whose type encodes sortedness/safety; a certified compiler pass with proof objects maintained by the build.

---

### 5.10 · **F9 — Univalent / Higher Foundations**

**Definition.** Frontier‑grade **higher foundations** (e.g., homotopy type theory / univalence); equality is treated as **structure**; proofs live at that level.
**Inclusion criteria.** Equivalences are recognized as identities by construction; properties rely on higher equalities.
**Non‑examples.** Any proof that does not hinge on higher‑dimensional equality is ≤F8.
**Indicative artifacts.** Formal developments where isomorphic structures are path‑equal by univalence; higher‑inductive types used to encode core invariants.

---

### 5.11 · Cross‑anchor cautions (normative)

* **Execution ≠ Proof.** Running code/examples (F5) is not a proof (F7+) unless proof obligations are explicitly encoded and checked.
* **Schema ≠ Semantics.** Parseable schemas (F2) are not logical constraints (F4) without semantic predicates.
* **Labels ≠ Levels.** “Approved,” “Final,” or “Published” are **status labels** and have no bearing on F unless they explicitly bind to these anchors.

---

## 6 · Assigning **F** in Practice (guidance)

This section is **informative**. It offers practical heuristics so engineers‑managers can triage artifacts quickly and consistently.

### 6.1 · Three questions to place a first guess

1. **Can a competent reader misread the claim?**
   If yes, you are likely ≤F2. If no (unique reading by construction), you are ≥F3.
2. **Are constraints stated as predicates over typed things?**
   If yes, you are around **F4**; if they are only executable tests without predicates, you’re **F5**.
3. **Would a tool *reject* an incorrect change?**
   If “only by rerunning examples,” that’s **F5**; if “because the logic kernel/type checker refuses it,” that’s **F7–F8**.

### 6.2 · Decision steps (quick rubric)

* **Has complete template?** If not, **F0–F1**. If yes →
* **Are per‑claim acceptances written (even informal)?** If not, **F2**. If yes →
* **Are they predicate‑like (quantifiers, implies, forall/exists)?** If yes, **F4**; if no, **F3**.
* **Is there an executable model with declared semantics?** If yes, **F5–F6** (hybrid if both discrete/continuous).
* **Are core properties machine‑proved?** If yes, **F7**; if types carry the property, **F8**; if higher equivalence is essential, **F9**.

### 6.3 · Litmus tests (do/don’t)

* **Do** point to the **lowest** rigor segment that is essential to the artifact; **F is capped by the weakest required part**.
* **Do** keep **F** independent from **R** and **G**: a well‑verified but informal hypothesis is **low F, high R**; a formal theorem without empirical content is **high F, R=N/A or VA‑lane only**.
* **Don’t** “average” levels: a long F8 appendix does not make an F3 body F8; F sticks to the **claim** or the **episteme**, not to page counts.
* **Don’t** upgrade F just because a tool was used; tooling matters only if the **content** reaches the anchor’s semantics.

### 6.4 · Anti‑patterns

* **Terminology inflation.** Calling acceptance criteria a “specification” without predicates → F3 at most.
* **Notebook mirage.** Treating an executable notebook with hidden state as formal proof → remains F5 without explicit obligations.
* **Schema worship.** Equating JSON Schema validity with logical safety → F2/F3, not F4.
* **Proof‑by‑CI.** “The pipeline is green” is not a logic kernel; without proofs or dependent types, F≤F6.

### 6.5 · Edge cases and how to rate them

* **Generated docs from formal sources.** Rate **by the source**, not the rendered prose. If the source is F7 proofs, the generated PDF remains **F7** as long as it is a faithful view.
* **Natural‑language with embedded formulas.** If formulas are illustrative only, keep **F3**; if they define obligations and are checkable, move **F4–F6** accordingly.
* **Contracts in code comments.** If they constrain behavior and are enforced (e.g., via runtime/type checks), consider **F4–F5**; otherwise **F3**.
* **Hybrid ML systems.** The training procedure (executable) suggests **F5**; safety guards as formal constraints can raise parts to **F4/F6**; certified components may reach **F7/F8**.

### 6.6 · Raising **F** (ΔF moves, informative)

Typical **ΔF** steps (see KD‑CAL motion primitives):

* **F2→F3:** Introduce controlled phrasing; per‑claim acceptances.
* **F3→F4:** Recast acceptances as typed predicates/invariants.
* **F4→F5:** Provide executable semantics with declared contracts.
* **F5→F7:** Encode properties in a proof‑capable logic; prove core invariants.
* **F7→F8/9:** Migrate property into types / adopt higher‑equality foundations.

> **Note.** ΔF does not require changing **G** or **R**. Many projects raise F while holding scope and evidence constant, then tackle R (validation) separately.

## 7 · Conformance (normative)

This section defines what it means to **use F correctly** in KD‑CAL. All “**SHALL**/**MUST**/**SHOULD**/**MAY**” statements here are normative.

### 7.1 · Declaration & Semantics

* **CC‑F‑1 (Declaration).** Every normative `U.Episteme` **SHALL** declare exactly one value for `U.Formality` (**F ∈ {F0…F9}**, or a context‑defined sub‑anchor that maps to one of these).
* **CC‑F‑2 (Ordinality).** F is an **ordinal Characteristic**: implementations **MUST NOT** perform arithmetic on F; only comparisons and thresholds are valid.
* **CC‑F‑3 (Polarity).** The polarity of F is **up**: a larger F value denotes **strictly greater or equal** expressive rigor than a smaller one.
* **CC‑F‑4 (No proxies).** Contexts **MUST NOT** introduce alternative “formality modes/tiers” as surrogates for F. If additional labels are desired, they **SHALL** be published as named **sub‑anchors** of F (see §4.3).

### 7.2 · Locality, Extensibility, and Anchors

* **CC‑F‑5 (Local extensibility).** A bounded context **MAY** introduce intermediate anchors (e.g., F6.5) and domain‑named anchors (e.g., “F4‑OCL”), **provided that** (a) the global F0…F9 order is preserved, and (b) each sub‑anchor is explicitly mapped to a parent anchor.
* **CC‑F‑6 (Anchor conservation).** Sub‑anchors **SHALL NOT** redefine the global meaning of their parent anchor (e.g., anything under F8 remains **proof‑grade**).

### 7.3 · Composition & Granularity

* **CC‑F‑7 (Weakest‑link fold).** For any composite episteme (theory, spec, model), the effective Formality **F\_composite** along any essential support path **SHALL** be computed as the **minimum** F of its essential parts on that path.
* **CC‑F‑8 (Granularity rule).** If different parts of an episteme carry different F values, the **episteme‑level F** is the **minimum** over all **essential** parts (non‑essential/illustrative parts are excluded).
* **CC‑F‑9 (No averaging).** Implementations **MUST NOT** average or otherwise combine F values numerically; the min rule suffices.

### 7.4 · Orthogonality & Non‑Interference

* **CC‑F‑10 (Orthogonality to G/R).** Changes in scope/envelope (G) or evidence (R) **SHALL NOT** alter F unless the **expression form** of the claims changes. Conversely, raising F **SHALL NOT** be interpreted as raising R or broadening G.
* **CC‑F‑11 (Notation‑agnostic).** Changing notations or carriers (Symbol side) **does not** change F if the claim graph and its formal content are preserved. Any translation loss is accounted for by **CL** penalties in R, not by altering F.

### 7.5 · Bridges & Cross‑Context Use

* **CC‑F‑12 (Bridges keep F stable).** When a claim is used across bounded contexts via a Bridge, the original F value **SHALL** be preserved in attribution. If the receiving context requires a different expression form, it **MUST** produce a **new episteme** (with its own F).
* **CC‑F‑13 (CL is for trust, not F).** Any mismatch across contexts **SHALL** be handled via Congruence Level (CL) and its effect on R; CL **MUST NOT** be used to down‑rate F.

### 7.6 · Traceability & Change

* **CC‑F‑14 (Observable basis).** An assigned F **SHALL** be justifiable by observable content (e.g., presence of predicates/invariants for F4; mechanized proofs for F7+).
* **CC‑F‑15 (ΔF disclosure).** A **ΔF** move (raising or, if justified by discovered error, lowering F) **SHALL** be recorded as a content change to the episteme. Whether a context versions that change is outside this pattern’s scope.

---

## 8 · Composition & Interaction (normative + informative notes)

### 8.1 · Inside one episteme (normative)

* **Essential paths.** Identify essential parts/claims that are required for the episteme’s truth. Apply **min‑F** along each support path; the **episteme‑level F** is the min over essential paths (CC‑F‑7, CC‑F‑8).
* **Episteme‑about (ReferencePlane=episteme).** Descriptions about other claims/epistemes carry their **own** F and do **not** raise the target’s F; any cross‑plane penalty flows via **CL^plane → R**.

> **Note (informative).** A long formal appendix (F8) attached to a largely narrative body (F3) does **not** make the whole F8; the episteme remains **F3** unless the core claims move into the formal appendix.

### 8.2 · Relation to **G** (scope/envelope) (normative)

* F concerns the **expression form** of the claim; G concerns its **claim scope**. Tightening the envelope without changing how the claim is expressed does not change F; re‑expressing the claim in a stricter form (e.g., predicates) can raise F without changing G.

> **Caution (informative).** Raising F often **reveals** hidden assumptions, which may lead to a **ΔG** (narrower envelope). Treat this as a **separate** change: update G explicitly rather than smuggling scope changes under F.

### 8.3 · Relation to **R** (evidence/assurance) (normative)

* **F ≠ R.** Proof‑grade expression (F7+) still requires binding to appropriate assurance lanes (VA/LA/TA) in the trust calculus; empirical claims may have high R with low F if they remain informal.
* **Decay independence.** F **does not decay** with time; R may decay (empirical freshness) or shift due to CL. Tool assurance (TA) is tracked independently of F.

> **Note (informative).** Higher F typically **enables** stronger R (easier to test or prove), but no automatic relationship is assumed.

### 8.4 · CL & Bridges (normative)

* **CL effects.** Using content across context boundaries requires a Bridge with a CL rating. CL affects **R** (penalties) and **never** changes **F** (CC‑F‑12/13).
* **Semantic change ⇒ new episteme.** If a cross‑context mapping **alters** the claim (e.g., coarsens predicates, drops obligations), treat it as a **new episteme** with its own F rather than “the same F with lower CL.”

### 8.5 · Motion primitives (informative)

* **ΔF** raises or (rarely) lowers the rigor of expression. Plan ΔF moves independently of **ΔG**/**ΔR**: projects often alternate “raise F” (make the claim checkable) with “raise R” (gather proof/validation) at a fixed G.
* **Cost signals.** Typical costs: authoring overhead (F3→F4), model encoding (F4→F5/6), proof engineering (F6→F7/8). The benefit is reduced ambiguity and safer composition.

### 8.6 · Gaps & thresholds (informative)

* **F‑gap** = ordinal difference between two F anchors (no arithmetic). Large gaps signal translation risk: an F8‑level component will not accept informal inputs (F2) except via additional formalization (ΔF) or robust alignment (CL‑guarded).

---

## 9 · Worked Examples (informative)

> Each mini‑case states the artifact, assigns **F**, and notes interactions with **G/R**. Examples are deliberately cross‑disciplinary to stress transdisciplinary comparability.

### 9.1 · Research hypothesis (physics)

**Artifact.** Short note proposing a new scaling law; clear vocabulary; scope “low‑Reynolds flows in microchannels.”
**F.** **F3** (controlled narrative with per‑claim acceptance in prose).
**G/R.** G is a narrow physical envelope; R is initially low (hypothesis).
**Next ΔF.** Recast acceptance as predicates over variables → **F4**; encode a simple simulation harness → **F5**.

### 9.2 · API specification (software)

**Artifact.** REST API doc with request/response schemas and explicit pre/postconditions; invariants like “idempotent under retry.”
**F.** **F4** (first‑order constraints).
**G/R.** G = stated resource model; R improves via conformance tests (independent).
**Next ΔF.** Reference implementation and executable test suite with declared contracts → **F5**; model‑check idempotence under failure injection → **F6**.

### 9.3 · Safety controller (cyber‑physical)

**Artifact.** Controller with plant model; safety distance invariant and braking envelope defined and verified in a hybrid model checker.
**F.** **F6** (hybrid formalism with obligations checked).
**G/R.** G = operating envelope (speed ranges, road conditions); R increases via track tests and simulation coverage.
**Next ΔF.** Encode key invariants in HOL and prove monotonicity → **F7**; migrate safety property into dependent types in the control kernel → **F8**.

### 9.4 · Decision policy (management)

**Artifact.** Escalation policy: if risk score ≥ θ and budget slack ≤ β, escalate to committee; otherwise defer.
**F.** **F3→F4** depending on phrasing. If the thresholds and variables are typed and the rule is predicate‑like, rate **F4**.
**G/R.** G = organizational scope (which portfolios, time windows); R entails retrospective calibration (did escalations match outcomes?).

### 9.5 · Verified algorithm (theory/software)

**Artifact.** Sorting function implemented with a dependent type ensuring output is ordered and a permutation of input; proof included.
**F.** **F8** (dependent/constructive proof).
**G/R.** G = data types and preconditions; R (empirical) is irrelevant; VA lane suffices (proof stands).

### 9.6 · ML classifier (data/ML)

**Artifact.** Training pipeline fully specified; metrics defined; OOD detection configured; no formal invariants.
**F.** **F5** (executable algorithmic semantics).
**G/R.** G = data distributions and deployment envelope; R grows with validation/monitoring.
**Next ΔF.** Add formal constraints for safety (e.g., monotonicity in features) → **F4/F6** for those aspects; certified post‑processing may achieve **F7** for a slice.

### 9.7 · Meta‑specification (method description)

**Artifact.** A guideline on how to review specs; it includes checklists and litmus tests.
**F.** **F3–F4** depending on whether checks are predicates.
**Interaction.** Its F does **not** lift the F of the reviewed artifacts; it only affects **R** via better CL (clearer alignments and fewer losses).

## 10 · Authoring & Review Guidance (informative)

This section helps engineering managers, architects, and researchers **assign F consistently**, plan **ΔF moves**, and **review** claims without slipping into status/process language.

### 10.1 · For authors — placing and raising **F**

* **Start honest.** If you’re drafting ideas in plain prose, declare **F0–F1**. You are not “behind”; you’re **appropriately early**.
* **Stabilize vocabulary first.** Move to **F2–F3** by making terms stable and acceptance statements unambiguous (controlled phrasing).
* **Name predicates next.** When acceptance can be written as **typed predicates** (“for all …, if … then …”), you have reached **F4**.
* **Give semantics to execution.** When readers can **run** a model/algorithm with *declared* semantics and see outcomes aligned with the predicates, you are in **F5** (hybrid + obligations → **F6**).
* **Prove what matters.** When the **logic kernel/type system** will **reject** incorrect changes to core claims, you are at **F7–F8**; if equality as structure is essential, **F9**.
* **Keep identity.** Prefer **ΔF** on the *same* episteme (raising rigor stepwise) over creating new documents; this keeps provenance and reduces translation error.

**Typical ΔF plan:** *Sketch (F1) → Controlled narrative (F3) → Predicates (F4) → Executable semantics (F5/6) → Machine‑checked core (F7/8).* Scope (G) and evidence (R) can remain fixed while F rises.

### 10.2 · For reviewers — verifying the declared **F**

Use **observable checks**:

* **F2?** Template is complete; terms don’t drift; “TBD” acceptance is explicitly marked.
* **F3?** Every claim has a **single reading** via constrained phrasing; hidden ambiguity is flagged.
* **F4?** Each critical claim is **predicate‑like** (typed variables, quantifiers/implication allowed); conflicts are **checkable in principle**.
* **F5?** Executable **semantics are declared**; runs/tests are not ad‑hoc but trace back to claims.
* **F6?** Hybrid obligations are **identified and linked** (discrete + continuous, or layered formalisms).
* **F7/8?** Incorrect edits to core claims are **rejected by the kernel/type system**; proof/scripts or proof‑objects exist and are traceable.
* **F9?** Higher equalities are **first‑class** (e.g., univalence), and core results rely on them.

**Failure modes to watch:** “green CI” as proof; schema validation treated as semantics; notebooks without declared semantics; long formal appendix while the main claim stays informal (rate by the **weakest essential part**).

### 10.3 · For integrators & architects — using **F** in composition

* **Plan around the minimum.** In any composition, **F\_composite = min F\_parts** along essential paths. Identify the **bottleneck F** first; your ΔF effort goes there.
* **Mind the F‑gaps.** Large ordinal gaps (e.g., F7 vs F2) imply translation risks and alignment costs. Either **raise** the low‑F part or insert **bridges** with explicit scope and confidence impacts (handled in **R** via **CL**).
* **Don’t upgrade by proximity.** An F8 component does not “elevate” an F3 neighbor. Keep F independent and visible.

### 10.4 · For assurance leads — relating **F** to **G/R** without conflation

* **F enables, R assures.** Raising **F** makes evidence easier to formulate and check; it does not **create** evidence. Rate R separately (calibration/validation/monitoring vs proof lanes).
* **G is separate.** Tightening **G** (scope/envelope) may accompany ΔF (as assumptions become explicit) — treat this as a **ΔG** move, not a side effect.
* **Use thresholds explicitly.** If a context expects “formalized before use,” write guard conditions as **`F ≥ k`**, not as status labels.

### 10.5 · Common pitfalls & remedies

| Pitfall                                   | Remedy                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Calling structured prose a “formal spec.” | If acceptance isn’t predicate‑like, rate **≤F3** and plan **ΔF: prose → predicates (F4)**.      |
| Treating runnable code as proof.          | Declare **F5**; add **stated obligations** and property checks to progress **F6–F7**.           |
| Averaging F across parts.                 | Use **min over essential parts**; if unsure which parts are essential, audit the support graph. |
| Letting status leak into F.               | Keep **status** (e.g., “accepted here”) separate; **F** is about expression only.               |

## 11 · Glossary & Notation (normative where noted)

**Formality (F).** `U.Formality` — an **ordinal Characteristic** with polarity **up**; default anchors **F0…F9** (§5). *(Normative)*

**Anchor (F‑anchor).** A named qualitative milestone on the F scale (e.g., F4 “first‑order constraints”). Sub‑anchors are context‑local refinements that **preserve order**. *(Normative)*

**ΔF.** A change to the expression form that alters F (usually **up**). Record as an episteme content change. *(Normative)*

**Essential part/path.** A part or claim without which the episteme’s central assertion does not hold. Composition applies **min‑F** along essential support paths. *(Normative)*

**Predicate / Invariant.** A typed, checkable statement about objects/states; at **F4** and above, critical claims are expressed as such.

**Machine‑checked / Proof‑carrying.** Content for which a logic kernel/type system rejects incorrect changes (F7+) or where programs and proofs are the same artifact (F8).

**Higher equality / Univalence.** Treatment of equivalence as identity in higher foundations relevant at **F9**.

**Notation & examples.**

* Declare as `F = Fk` (e.g., `F = F4`).
* Sub‑anchor: `F = F4[OCL]` or `F = F7[HOL]`.
* Thresholds in prose: “requires **F ≥ F6** for core claims.”
* Mixed parts: list per part if useful (e.g., “Body F3; Appendix proofs F7 — **episteme F3**”).

## 12 · Change Log & Patch Notes (normative migration)

**12.1 Supersession.**
This pattern **supersedes** the legacy “modes/tiers” language. Any references to “M‑mode/F‑mode”, “publication tiers”, or parallel “formality ladders” are **deprecated**. From now on, **Formality** is expressed **only** as **F** with default anchors **F0…F9** (and optional sub‑anchors per §4.3).

**12.2 Impacted cross‑references.**

* **C.2.2 (F–G–R).** Replace any generic “F‑ladder” description with a normative reference to **C.2.3** and treat **F** in the triple as defined here (including **min‑F** composition).
* **ESG/RSG text.** Where guards previously referenced “modes/tiers,” rewrite guards as **`F ≥ Fk`** conditions.
* **Meta‑descriptions.** Ensure meta‑artifacts carry **their own F** and do not “lift” a target artifact’s F; use **CL→R** for cross‑context penalties, not F changes.

**12.3 Transitional guidance.**

* **Legacy artifacts without F.** Assign an initial F by applying the rubric in **§6**; record the assignment as a content attribution (not as a status change).
* **Legacy labels in prose.** Replace them with explicit **F** declarations. If prose implies mixed rigor, rate by the **weakest essential** segment (see §7.3).
* **No dual systems.** Do not keep “modes” alongside F; remove proxies and speak **F directly**.

**12.4 Backward compatibility (non‑normative note).**
During editorial refresh, it is acceptable to annotate historical records with both the **new F** and the legacy note for provenance. Forward‑looking reasoning and composition, however, **SHALL** use **F only**.

**12.5 Versioning & edits.**
Raising or (exceptionally) lowering **F** constitutes a **content change** (ΔF). Whether such a change triggers a new edition in a given Context is **outside this pattern**; respect the Context’s edition policy while keeping **F** accurate.

# C.3 · **Kind‑CAL — Kinds, Intent/Extent, and Typed Reasoning**  \[A]

> **One‑line summary.** Establishes **`U.Kind`** as the **minimal, context‑local intensional carrier** of “what a statement is about,” separates **intent** (KindSignature + its own **F**) from **extent** (*which* instances belong to the kind **in a given Context slice**), and situates **typed reasoning** alongside **USM Scope (G)** and **F–G–R** without conflation. Details of the core objects and operations live in **C.3.1–C.3.5**; guard shapes are standardized in **C.3.A**.

---

## 0 · Status, Placement, Dependencies & Sub‑pattern Map  \[A]

**Status.** Normative architheory in **Part C**. Identifier **C.3**. This pattern lays the **architectural invariant** and manager‑level guidance. The **mechanics** are defined by its child patterns.

**Readers.** Engineering managers, architects, and assurance leads who must reason about *typed claims* across Contexts without mixing up **aboutness** (Kinds), **applicability** (**G**), and **assurance** (**R**).

**Depends on.**
— **A.2.6 USM** (Context slices & Scopes): **`U.ClaimScope` = G**, **`U.WorkScope`**, ∈/∩/**SpanUnion**/translate, **Γ\_time** policy, Bridges + **CL** (scope).
— **C.2.2 F–G–R**: weakest‑link composition; penalties to **R** for Cross‑context congruence (CL).
— **C.2.3 Unified Formality F**: F0…F9 as an **ordinal Characteristic** (expression rigor).

**Sub‑patterns (normative unless noted).**
— **C.3.1** · `U.Kind` & `U.SubkindOf` (partial order).
— **C.3.2** · `KindSignature` (**intent**, with **F**) & `Extension/MemberOf` (**extent** in a slice).
— **C.3.3** · **KindBridge** & **`CL^k`** (type‑congruence; penalties route to **R**).
— **C.3.4** · **RoleMask** (context‑local adaptation without cloning kinds).
— **C.3.5** · **KindAT** (K0…K3, **informative facet**, not a Characteristic).
— **C.3.A** · **Typed Guard Macros** (annex): admit/compose, masks, Cross‑context reuse; AT is **forbidden** in guards.

**Deprecations.**
— “**Generality ladder**” for **G**; **G is Scope** only (set‑valued over `U.ContextSlice`).
— Any “**Kind scope**” characteristic (Kinds carry **intent/extent**, not Scope).
— **Mark as legacy** any uses of **‘validity’ as a Characteristic** or **‘operation’ as a Scope‑like Characteristic**; **redirect** to **`U.ClaimScope`** / **`U.WorkScope`** (A.2.6) for applicability. Editors SHOULD add glossary redirects in Part E.

**Editorial note (cut‑over).** Content formerly in C.3 that defined guard shapes, decision trees, and macro anti‑patterns now resides in **C.3.A**. Membership **evaluation obligations** live in **C.3.2** with `MemberOf`.

## 1 · Purpose & Rationale  \[A/I]

**What you get.**

1. A **neutral typed layer**: name *what* a claim quantifies over (**Kinds**) without binding to any particular “type technology” (OWL, PL types, shapes…).
2. A clean **split of characteristics**:
   – **Scope (G)** = *where* a claim holds (USM, set‑valued over **Context slices**).
   – **Kind extent** = *which instances* belong to a kind **inside** a given slice.
   – **F** = *how strictly* content is expressed (C.2.3).
   – **R** = *how well supported* (evidence & congruence penalties).
3. **Typed reuse across Contexts**: a dedicated **KindBridge** with **`CL^k`** (type‑congruence), so you can predict risk **without** touching F or G.
4. **Manager‑oriented maps**: when to invest in **formalization** (F), when to expand/narrow **Scope** (ΔG), when to test across **subkinds** (R), and what kind of **bridge** you should expect.

**Why it helps.**
Teams routinely overspend on proofs for **instance‑level** questions and underspecify scope for **class‑level** claims. By naming the **Kind**, you plan **ΔF/ΔR** correctly and keep **G honest**. Typed checks also block unsafe compositions (“we were talking about different things”).

---

## 2 · Context  \[I]

Cross‑disciplinary work mixes artifacts that *look like “types”* but behave differently: ontology classes, schema “shapes,” programming types, BORO super/sub categories, ad‑hoc labels. At the same time, **USM** made “scope” precise. What was missing was a *small, neutral* notion of **aboutness** that (a) **does not** re‑invent a global “type system,” (b) composes with USM and F–G–R, and (c) lets Contexts keep their idioms—**with bridges** when crossing boundaries.

---

## 3 · Problem  \[I]

1. **Scope–type conflation.** Authors try to widen **G** by “abstracting the wording,” yielding claims that *sound* general but are only supported on a thin slice.
2. **Silent drift across Contexts.** A “vehicle” here is not the same as a “transport unit” there; reuse proceeds without a declared mapping or risk accounting.
3. **Wasteful planning.** Without a signal about the *kind‑level*, teams either over‑formalize single‑slice decisions or under‑test class‑level claims (no variant coverage along subkinds).
4. **Unsafe composition.** Claims about incompatible “things” get composed because the aboutness was implicit in prose.

---

## 4 · Forces  \[I]

| Force                             | Tension to resolve                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local freedom vs global sense** | Contexts need their own vocabularies; Cross‑context work needs a common skeleton for **aboutness**.      |
| **Minimality vs utility**         | The notion of kind must be tiny yet powerful enough to guide ΔF/ΔR/bridges/composition.            |
| **Intent vs extent**              | Kinds come with a **definition** and a **population in place**; both are needed and must not mix.  |
| **Typed discipline vs F–G–R**     | Typed safety must not distort **G** (Scope) nor introduce a parallel “assurance math.”             |
| **Abstraction vs applicability**  | “Higher abstraction” is **not** “wider applicability”; the framework must make this split obvious. |

## 5 · Solution — Architectural Decisions (overview)  \[A]

**C.3‑D1 — `U.Kind` is intensional and context‑local.**
Kinds name *what a claim quantifies over*. They form a partial order **`⊑`** (**SubkindOf**). *(See C.3.1.)*

**C.3‑D2 — Separate **intent** and **extent**.**
— **KindSignature(k)**: the intensional content (predicates/invariants/contracts). It carries its **own F** (C.2.3).
— **Extension(k, slice)**/**MemberOf**: which instances belong to `k` **in a given `U.ContextSlice`**. *(See C.3.2.)*

**C.3‑D3 — Kinds do **not** carry Scope.**
**Scope** lives with **claims/capabilities** (USM): a set of **Context slices** where the statement holds. Kinds carry **intent/extent** only. *(USM A.2.6 + C.3.2.)*

**C.3‑D4 — Typed reuse across Contexts is explicit.**
Use a **KindBridge** with **`CL^k`** (type‑congruence) and loss notes. Its effect is **only via R** penalties; **F/G remain unchanged**. *(See C.3.3.)*

**C.3‑D5 — Local adaptation without cloning.**
Use a **RoleMask** to bind a kind to Context‑specific constraints/aliases; promote to a **subkind** if the mask becomes stable and widely reused. *(See C.3.4.)*

**C.3‑D6 — An **informative** “abstraction tier” exists for Kinds (AT: K0…K3).**
A facet (not a Characteristic) that helps plan **ΔF/ΔR** and forecast bridge style; **AT never appears in guards**. *(See C.3.5.)*

**C.3‑D7 — Guard shapes are standardized and fail‑closed.**
Typed compatibility first (same‑Context **`⊑`** or **KindBridge**), then **Scope coverage** (USM), then **R** penalties and freshness. *(See C.3.A.)*

> **Manager’s picture — Two characteristics (keep them separate).**
> – **characteristic 1 (USM, G):** *Where* the claim holds → set of **Context slices**; composed by ∈ (membership) / ∩ (intersection) / **SpanUnion** (union across independent lines) / translate (scope mapping).
> – **characteristic 2 (Kind extent):** *Which instances* in a **given slice** belong to the kind → `MemberOf(e, k, slice)`.
> **Never “widen G” by abstract wording; widen only by ΔG with support.**

## 6 · Core Concepts (informative summary; authoritative norms live in C.3.1–C.3.5)  \[I]


> This section fixes the **contract** of terms used in C.3 and points to the sub‑patterns for complete mechanics. All “**SHALL/MUST**” statements here are normative.

**Editorial note.** This section is **informative**. It restates manager‑level takeaways and **points to** the canonical, normative rules in **C.3.1–C.3.5**. Where this section summarizes a rule, treat the cited sub‑pattern (and rule ID) as the **source of truth**.


### 6.1 · `U.Kind` & `U.SubkindOf (⊑)`  \[A]

**Definition.** `U.Kind` is a **context‑local intensional object** naming a “kind of thing” that claims may quantify over.
**Order.** `U.SubkindOf (⊑)` is a **partial order** (reflexive, transitive, antisymmetric). We write `k₁ ⊑ k₂`.

**Summary of norms** *(authoritative text: **C.3.1 K‑01–K‑02**)*.
— Contexts treat `⊑` as a partial order and document any computed meets/joins if they provide them.
— Kinds do not carry Scope; Scope remains on claims/capabilities (USM).

> *Full treatment:* **C.3.1** (definitions, invariants, examples).

---

### 6.2 · **KindSignature** (intent) & **F**  \[A]

**Definition.** `KindSignature(k)` is the **intent**: predicates/invariants/contracts that define the kind in the Context. Its expression rigor has an explicit **`U.Formality`** (C.2.3).

**Summary of norms** *(authoritative text: **C.3.2 K‑03–K‑04**)*.
— `KindSignature(k)` declares its F (C.2.3). Claim‑level F does **not** auto‑inherit; weakest‑link applies on the claim’s own support paths.
— If a signature change alters membership, treat it as a content change (Contexts may version kinds).

> *Full treatment:* **C.3.2** (signature/intent with F; relation to claims).

---

### 6.3 · **Extension** & **MemberOf** (extent in a slice)  \[A]

**Definition.** `Extension(k, slice) ⊆ EntitySpace(slice)` = set of instances that belong to `k` **in the given `U.ContextSlice`**. `MemberOf(e, k, slice)` is the membership predicate: `e ∈ Extension(k, slice)`.

**Summary of norms** *(authoritative text: **C.3.2 K‑05–K‑08**)*.
— Membership is deterministic for a fixed `(k, slice)` (no hidden “latest”).
— If `k₁ ⊑ k₂`, then `Extension(k₁,slice) ⊆ Extension(k₂,slice)` for all slices.
— Definedness may be bounded; outside it, guards fail closed.
— Keep **Scope (G)** and **MemberOf** as distinct guard predicates.

> *Full treatment:* **C.3.2** (extent semantics, examples, authoring hints).

---

### 6.4 · **KindBridge** & **`CL^k`** (type‑congruence)  \[A]

**Summary of norms** *(authoritative text: **C.3.3 KB‑01–KB‑12**)*.
— A KindBridge states Contexts/versions, kind mapping/rules, preserved order links, **`CL^k`** anchors, loss notes, and definedness.
— No inversions of preserved subkind links; collapses must be declared.
— When classification depends on a KindBridge, apply a monotone penalty **Ψ(`CL^k`)** to **R** (scope‑bridge **Φ(CL)** applies separately). **F** and **G** remain unchanged.
— Chaining uses weakest‑link on **`CL^k`**.

> *Full treatment:* **C.3.3** (bridge shape, anchors, examples).

---

### 6.5 · **RoleMask** (adaptation without cloning)  \[A]

**Definition.** `U.RoleMask(kind, Context)` is a **named binding** that carries constraints (optional **narrowing** of membership), vocabulary/notation aliases, and intended use for local procedures—**without** creating a new Kind.

**Summary of norms** *(authoritative text: **C.3.4 RM‑01–RM‑08**)*.
— Masks are registered/versioned; constraints are observable/deterministic at guard time.
— Do not treat masks as kind synonyms; promote frequently reused constraint masks to explicit subkinds (`⊑`).


> *Full treatment:* **C.3.4** (mask taxonomy, guard discipline, promotion rule).

---

### 6.6 · **KindAT (K0…K3)** — *informative facet*  \[I]

**Status.** A **facet** attached to `U.Kind`, not a Characteristic: no algebra, **never** used in guards or composition.

**Anchors (intentional view).**
**K0** Instance; **K1** Behavioral pattern; **K2** Formal kind/class; **K3** Up‑to‑Iso.

**Use.** Helps plan **ΔF/ΔR** and forecast bridge style (e.g., K3↔K3 suggests up‑to‑iso mapping). Do **not** conflate AT with **G** or **R**.

> *Full treatment:* **C.3.5** (manager heuristics, anti‑misuse).

---

### 6.7 · Quick examples (two‑characteristic awareness)  \[I]

**E‑Sketch 1 — Policy over `Vehicle`.**
Claim: “For all `x ∈ Vehicle`: brakeDistance(x) ≤ 50 m (dry), ≤ 40 m (wet).”
– **Aboutness:** `Vehicle` (Kind, typically K2) — *what* we quantify over.
– **Scope (G):** `{surface∈{dry,wet}, speed≤50, rig=v3, Γ_time=rolling 180d}` — *where* the claim holds.
– **Extent in slice:** which instances the lab currently classifies as `Vehicle` (via `MemberOf`).
Typed checks happen **before** Scope intersection; **G** is not widened by “abstract wording.”

**E‑Sketch 2 — API rule over `AuthenticatedRequest`.**
Producer A emits `Request`; consumer B expects `AuthenticatedRequest`.
– If `Request ⊑ AuthenticatedRequest` **does not** hold, add an **adapter** or adopt a **subkind**; do **not** force fit by widening **G**.
– Scope remains independent (API version, Γ\_time policy); evidence/freshness sits in **R**.

## 7 · How to use typed reasoning \[A/I]

## 7.1 How typed reasoning plugs into **F–G–R & USM**

### 7.1.1 · The basic shape of a typed claim (manager view)  \[I]

A typed claim has two independent parts:

1. **Aboutness (Kind).** *Which things the statement talks about.*
   “For every item of kind **k** in the **target context** (the selected **TargetSlice**) …”.
   — The **definition** of kind **k** lives in **KindSignature(k)** (with its **F**, C.3.2).
   — **Which items count as “k”** is evaluated in the **TargetSlice** (C.3.2) by a deterministic membership check.

2. **Applicability (Scope, G).** *Where the statement holds.*
   `U.ClaimScope(Claim)` is the **collection of contexts** where the claim is valid (USM A.2.6). Guards test: “Scope **covers** the TargetSlice”.

**Discipline.** The guard first checks **typed compatibility** (in the same Context: “is‑a / subkind‑of”; across Contexts: a **KindBridge**, C.3.3), then **Scope coverage** (USM), then **R** freshness and any bridge congruence penalties. See **C.3.A Guard\_TypedClaim**.

---

### 7.1.2 · Composition of typed claims  \[A]

**Rule C‑T‑1 (typed pre‑check).** To compose a **producer claim** with a **consumer claim**, where the producer quantifies over kind **k (source)** and the consumer expects kind **k (expected)**:

* **same Context:** require **“is‑a / subkind‑of”** to hold (the source kind is a subkind of the expected kind) (C.3.1).
* **Cross‑context:** require a **KindBridge** that maps the source kind to a **local kind that is a subkind of the expected kind** in the target Context (C.3.3). If neither holds, the composition is **unsafe**; introduce a subkind, add an adapter (or a RoleMask), or decline.

* **Role‑aware option (same Context):** if the consumer expects a **RoleMask** over the expected kind, you may satisfy the mask’s explicit constraints (C.3.4) instead of changing kinds, provided those constraints are observable at gate time.

**Rule C‑T‑2 (scope after type).** After typed compatibility is satisfied, compute Scope as in USM:

* **Serial path:** take the **intersection** of the contributors’ claim scopes.
* **Parallel independent lines:** use **SpanUnion** of the serial scopes (only if independence is justified).

**Rule C‑T‑3 (no type‑by‑scope).** A kind mismatch **MUST NOT** be “fixed” by widening **G**. Changes in aboutness require **subkind introduction**, **signature edits**, or a **KindBridge**—not a scope change.

**Manager hint.** First confirm the **port shape** matches (kinds line up), then check the **operating area** (scope), and finally look at **confidence** (evidence freshness plus any bridge congruence penalties).

---

### 7.1.3 · F–G–R with typed claims (what changes, what doesn’t)  \[A/I]

* **F (Formality).**
  – **Claim‑level F** follows C.2.3 (weakest‑link along the claim’s support paths).
  – **KindSignature F** is declared **on the kind** (C.3.2) and influences claims **only** if the claim essentially depends on those predicates (weakest‑link again).
  – **Raising F** can *reveal* hidden assumptions (which may trigger ΔG in the claim), but **does not change G** by itself.

* **G (Scope).**
  – Always **set‑valued over Context slices** (USM A.2.6).
  – Typed reasoning does not alter G’s algebra (∈/∩/SpanUnion/translate).
  – Never infer Scope from “how general the wording sounds.”

* **R (Reliability).**
  – Evidence freshness/decay (validation windows) remains separate from Scope coverage.
  – **Cross‑context penalties** split cleanly: a **scope‑bridge penalty** (USM) and a **kind‑bridge penalty** (C.3.3). Both **reduce R only**; neither changes **F** or **G**.

**Manager rule of thumb.**
Start with the reliability from your support; then **apply the scope‑bridge penalty**; then **apply the kind‑bridge penalty**. Each step can only reduce reliability.  
You never add or average **F/G**: you **compose scope** per USM rules and apply **weakest‑link** for F/R along support paths.

---

### 7.1.4 · ESG gating with typed claims  \[A]

* **Gate on F**, if your Context requires rigor before use (e.g., `U.Formality(Claim) ≥ F4`).
* **Gate on Scope coverage** (USM) and an explicit **time selector** (Γ_time) policy.
* **Gate on R freshness** and **minimum congruence** for bridges (e.g., `CL ≥ 2`, `CL^k ≥ 2`).
* **Do not** gate on **AT** (C.3.5); it is an informative facet only.
* Use **C.3.A guard macros** to keep guards short and auditable.

### 7.2 · How typed reasoning plugs into the CAL chain (Lang‑CHR → Role‑CAL)  \[A/I]

> **Intent.** Show a clear, end‑to‑end path a manager can follow to take a typed claim from words to safe reuse across Contexts—without any tool or data‑governance assumptions. Each stage says **what it supplies**, **what it needs**, and **what it hands off** to the next stage.

---

#### 7.2.1 **Lang‑CHR** — stable words first  \[A/I]

**What it supplies.** A disciplined vocabulary and controlled phrasing so that terms like *Vehicle*, *AuthenticatedRequest*, *AdultPatient* have **one meaning** in the Context.

**What it requires.** Authors use controlled narrative (C.2.3 **F3**) at minimum: single‑meaning terms, explicit “shall / if / then”, and no drifting synonyms.

**Hand‑off.** A small, curated lexicon entry for each candidate *Kind‑word*; these become **`U.Kind` names** in the next step.

> *Manager hint.* If two teams cannot agree on the noun, you are not ready to type the claim. Resolve the noun in Lang‑CHR before introducing a Kind.

---

#### 7.2.2 **Kind‑CAL** (this Part) — name the *aboutness*  \[A]

**What it supplies.**
• **`U.Kind`** objects for those nouns; a partial order **`⊑`** (subkind‑of).
• **KindSignature(k)** (intent), with declared **F**.
• **Extension(k, slice)** and **`MemberOf(e,k,slice)`** (extent).
• (Optional) **AT (K0…K3)** as an **informative facet**.

**What it requires.**
• Deterministic membership (no “latest” defaults) and a clear rule for where membership is defined in each context.
• No “Kind scope”: Scope remains with claims/capabilities (USM).

> *Manager hint.* Use the kind’s **AT tag** only as a planning signal (where to invest rigor and tests). AT never gates decisions and never widens scope.

**Hand‑off.** Typed quantifier sites for claims: “∀ x ∈ **Extension(k, slice)** …”, plus a visible **`⊑`** lattice for compatibility checks down the line. Typed claim sites written in Plain language: “for every item of kind **k** in the **target context** …”, plus a visible **subkind‑of** lattice for compatibility checks down the line.

> *Manager hint.* Decide early whether your Kind is K0 (instance‑ish) or K2 (formal class). It sets your **ΔF/ΔR** budget expectations.

---

#### 7.2.3 **Structure‑CAL** — give Kinds usable shape  \[A/I]

**What it supplies.** Structural building blocks **on Kinds**:
• **combinations** (“and”),
• **alternatives** (“either/or”),
• **records** (named fields),
• **functions** (inputs to outputs),
plus relations like **has‑attribute** and **part‑kind**, and the minimal invariants those structures must respect.

**What it requires.**
• Do not hide Scope inside structure.
• Put structural rules into the **KindSignature** as checkable statements (ideally **F4+**).

**Hand‑off.** Typed *ports and shapes* of claims/specifications (“this policy expects `PassengerCar × ControllerConfig`”), making compatibility checks crisp before any Scope math.

> *Manager hint.* If two claims expect different shapes (for example, one needs “Vehicle with ABS”, the other just “Vehicle”), plan a **subkind** or an **adapter**. Do not “solve” it by rewording the claim.

**Note (informative).** If a Context declares structural constructors on kinds (e.g., product/sum/record/function), editors SHOULD document the corresponding **Extension** inclusion laws for those constructors. Keep Scope in USM; do not hide it in structure.

---

#### 7.2.4 **Compose‑CAL** — compose with typed pre‑checks  \[A]

**What it supplies.** The **order of checks** you must follow for safe composition:

1. **Typed compatibility**: in the same Context, the producer’s kind **is a subkind of** the consumer’s kind; across Contexts, a **KindBridge** maps the producer’s kind to a local kind that fits, with an acceptable **kind‑bridge congruence level** (C.3.3).
2. **Scope checks** (USM): along dependency paths, take the **intersection** of scopes; use **SpanUnion** only when support lines are truly independent.
3. **Assurance wiring**: apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** and the **kind‑bridge penalty** to **R**; check evidence freshness separately.

**What it requires.** Independence justification for **SpanUnion**; no “type‑by‑scope” fixes.

**Hand‑off.** A typed, scope‑checked composition that survives audit because each risk is accounted for in **R**.

> *Manager hint.* Run the **typed pre‑check** first. It is the cheapest failure to catch and prevents “scope gymnastics” that mask a type mismatch.

---

#### 7.2.5 **CT2R‑LOG** — speak the logic, keep the math honest  \[A/I]

**What it supplies.**
• A clear logical reading of your typed claim: “for every item of kind **K**, condition **φ** holds” (or “there exists an item …”).
• Rules for refinement and substitution that respect the **subkind‑of** relation.
• When appropriate (K3), reasoning that treats structures as **equivalent up to isomorphism** (useful where exact identity is the wrong notion).

**What it requires.**
• Pick a logic that matches the **Formality** you declare (e.g., machine‑checked logic for higher **F**).
• When the logic travels across Contexts, use a **KindBridge** to keep meaning aligned; any mismatch is reflected as a **kind‑bridge penalty** in **R**.

**Hand‑off.** Proof obligations or reasoning templates that are consistent with your Kind/Structure setup and do not alter **G**.  **Shall‑note CT2R‑1.** Transferring typed formulas that depend on `MemberOf` across Contexts **uses a KindBridge**; any mismatch is accounted as **Ψ(`CL^k`)** in **R**. **F** and **G** remain unchanged. For **up‑to‑iso** situations, see **C.3.5 (AT)** for when K3 is appropriate.

> *Manager hint.* If your proof keeps failing when you move between Contexts, add a **bridge at the Kind level**; do not try to “fix” it by changing scope.

---

#### 7.2.6 **Role‑CAL** — adapt without cloning  \[A]

**What it supplies.** **RoleMask(kind, Context)**: a named, registered adaptation (extra constraints or local aliases, with optional narrowing) that reuses the **same** kind instead of creating a new one.

**What it requires.**
• Constraints must be testable at gate time and give deterministic answers.
• If a constraint mask is reused often, **promote it to a subkind**.

**Hand‑off.** Context‑specific views that keep identity intact and make typed guards practical (“use `PaymentAccount@PCI` mask in these steps”).

> *Manager hint.* If the same mask appears in several guards, **promote** it to a subkind. This reduces future bridge and audit effort.

---

#### 7.2.7 Mini end‑to‑end example (manager‑oriented)

> **Scenario.** A risk gate for API requests must be reused by another program across Contexts.

**Lang‑CHR.** Settle on *Request*, *AuthenticatedRequest*, *RiskScore*, *BudgetSlack*; write them in controlled phrases (F3).

**Kind‑CAL.**
• Define `Kind Request` (K2) and a **subkind** `AuthenticatedRequest ⊑ Request`;  publish a **KindBridge** for the PCI taxonomy with **kind‑bridge congruence level 2** (loss note: token class is collapsed).
• Membership `MemberOf(e, AuthenticatedRequest, slice)` is deterministic under API v2.3 and Γ\_time policy.

**Structure‑CAL.**
• `AuthenticatedRequest` is a **record kind** with fields (headers, tokenProof, body); invariants relate tokenProof to headers.

**Compose‑CAL.**
• Policy P says in Plain terms: “for every **AuthenticatedRequest** in the **target context**, deny the call when **riskScore** is at or above the set **risk threshold** and **budgetSlack** is at or below the set **budget limit**.”
• Another service S expects `PCIRequest`. Typed pre‑check: does `AuthenticatedRequest ⊑ PCIRequest`? No.
• Remedy: adapter A proves `AuthenticatedRequest → PCIRequest` in this Context; if reusing across Contexts, publish a **KindBridge** for the PCI taxonomy with **`CL^k=2`** (loss: token class collapsed).

**CT2R‑LOG.**
• State P in a state P in a proof‑checked logic (where appropriate for F7+), so that changes to token rules break proofs. Proofs rely on the **AuthenticatedRequest** definition, not on the consumer’s scope.

**Role‑CAL.**
• Register a **RoleMask** over `PCIRequest` for the consuming team; guards must be able to test the mask’s constraints at gate time.

**Outcome.**
• **Typed guard** approves only when: (i) the type pre‑check passes (same‑Context subkind‑of or a KindBridge with an acceptable congruence level), (ii) **Scope** covers the target context (API v2.3, explicit time selector), and (iii) **R** reflects the **scope‑bridge** and **kind‑bridge** penalties and evidence is fresh.
• No one widened Scope to hide a type mismatch; the adapter + bridge made the semantics explicit and auditable.

---

> **Takeaway.** If you keep these six hand‑offs in view—words → kinds → structure → composition → logic → roles—you get **predictable reviews**, **clean risk accounting**, and **reusable claims** that travel across Contexts without silent meaning drift.

### 7.3 · Compliance & Regulatory Alignment — profile  \[A/I]

Treat regulatory categories as **Kinds**, carry their **intent** in `KindSignature` with declared **F**, move them across Contexts with a **KindBridge** (type‑congruence **`CL^k`** + loss notes), and express applicability as **Claim scope** over `U.ContextSlice` (with explicit **Γ_time**). Any Cross‑context uncertainty is routed to **R** via **Ψ(`CL^k`)** (kind) and **Φ(CL)** (scope); **F** and **G** remain unchanged.

> **Authoritative obligations and guard macros** (C‑REG‑1…8, Guard_RegAdopt / Guard_RegChange / Guard_RegXContextUse) and worked scenarios live in **C.3.A, Annex A (Regulatory adoption profile)**.


### 7.4 · How typed reasoning plugs into **Assurance Lanes (VA/LA/TA) & Evidence design**  \[A/I]

**Intent (manager’s view).** Typed reasoning turns “prove/test/qualify” into a **repeatable plan** by making *what the rule talks about* explicit (named **Kinds**, their **subkinds**, optional **RoleMasks**) and keeping **Scope (G)** over `U.ContextSlice` separate from **membership** inside the slice. Cross‑context uncertainty (Scope Bridge **CL**, KindBridge **`CL^k`**) always routes to **R** as penalties **Φ/Ψ**; it never changes **F** or **G**.

**Evidence matrix (sketch).**

| Row set                       | Column set                                                   | Cell content                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kinds** (subkinds or masks) | **Context slices** (contract versions, env ranges, `Γ_time`) | **Evidence unit** (proof fragment, test batch, monitoring window), with **Scope** and **MemberOf** predicates attached |

*Tip.* For formal kinds and “up‑to‑iso” kinds (AT K2/K3), expect **more rows** (variants). For instance‑like kinds (AT K0), expect **fewer rows** and **tighter columns** (narrow slices, stricter freshness).

> **Authoritative evidence obligations and guard macros** (planning/attachment, VA/LA/TA duties, anti‑patterns) are in **C.3.A, Annex B**.

### 7.5 · How typed reasoning plugs into **ESG and Method–Work gating**  \[A]

> Intent. Make state changes and work admissions deterministic, auditable, and safe by separating (1) **typed compatibility** (what the statement or capability is about) from (2) **scope coverage** (where it holds or can run). Any Cross‑context uncertainty is routed to **R** (reliability) only—never to **F** (form) or **G** (scope).

---

#### 7.5.1 · Scope & fit

This subsection defines **normative guard obligations** for:

* **ESG** (Episteme State Graph) transitions whose assertions **quantify over kinds**, and
* **Method–Work** admissions where a **capability** expects inputs/outputs of specified kinds.

It reuses:

* **USM** (A.2.6): `U.ClaimScope` (G) and `U.WorkScope` coverage + `Γ_time`,
* **Kind‑CAL core** (C.3.1–C.3.2): `U.Kind`, `MemberOf(e,k,slice)`, `⊑`,
* **KindBridge** (C.3.3) with **`CL^k`** and loss notes,
* **Scope Bridge** (Part B) with **CL** and loss notes,
* **RoleMask** (C.3.4) when local adaptations of a kind are used,
* **Formality F** (C.2.3) when transitions gate on rigor,
* **Assurance R** (C.2.2) for evidence freshness and penalties Φ/Ψ.

**Guard macros.** The **normative guard shapes** for ESG and Method–Work (**Guard_TypedClaim**, **Guard_TypedJoin**, **Guard_MaskedUse**, **Guard_XContext_Typed**) are specified in **Annex C.3.A С**. Use those shapes; the present section is a manager‑level overview only.

#### 7.5.2 · Inputs & roles (at guard time)

* **TargetSlice** — the specific context you are deciding for: Context, versioned contracts, environment parameters, and an explicit **time selector (Γ_time)**.
* **Typed carriers**

  * **ESG:** the **Claim** quantifies over one or more **Kinds** (e.g., “for all vehicles in the target context …”).
  * **Method–Work:** the **Capability** declares expected input/output kinds (and possibly RoleMasks).
* **Thresholds** (context‑local policy):

  * Minimum **F** level for the Claim (if the Context gates on rigor),
  * Minimum **congruence** for **scope bridges**,
  * Minimum **type‑congruence** for **KindBridges**,
  * Evidence **freshness windows** (R‑lane).
* **Evidence bundle** (if the transition implies trust): references, dates, windows.

---
#### 7.5.3 · Manager’s 7‑step checklist (operational)

1. **Name the slice.** Write the full `TargetSlice`/`JobSlice` tuple including **`Γ_time`**.
2. **Check coverage.** Claim/Work scope **covers** the slice (USM).
3. **Check typed definedness.** A deterministic membership check is available in this context for every kind you use (and any masks are registered).
4. **Check typed compatibility.** same Context: `⊑` (or mask constraints met). Cross‑context: **KindBridge** with **`CL^k ≥ c`**.
5. **Bridge scope if needed.** Scope Bridge with **CL ≥ c** for Cross‑context scope.
6. **Apply penalties to R.** Apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** and the **kind‑bridge penalty**; then check evidence **freshness** windows.
7. **(If gated) Check F.** Enforce `Formality ≥ F_k` for the transition.

> **Remember:** **F** and **G** never change because of bridges; only **R** is penalized. AT (K0…K3) is informative and **not** used in guards.

---

#### 7.5.4 · Cross‑references

* **USM / A.2.6:** Scope coverage, `Γ_time`, serial **∩**, **SpanUnion**, Bridge+CL.
* **Kind‑CAL / C.3.1–C.3.4:** `U.Kind`, `⊑`, `MemberOf`, RoleMask, KindBridge + **`CL^k`**.
* **Formality / C.2.3:** `U.Formality` thresholds (when ESG gates on rigor).
* **Assurance / C.2.2:** Freshness windows; **Φ(CL)** and **Ψ(`CL^k`)** penalties to **R** (weakest‑link on paths).

This subsection is **normative** for guards in ESG and Method–Work that **use kinds**.

## 8 · Cross‑context typed reuse & assurance accounting  \[A/I]

### 8.1 · The **two‑bridge rule** (mandatory)  \[A]

When any part of the use crosses Contexts:

1. **Scope Bridge** (USM/Part B) with **CL** → penalty **Φ(CL)** to **R**.
2. **KindBridge** (C.3.3) with **`CL^k`** → penalty **Ψ(`CL^k`)** to **R**.

Both bridges carry **loss notes**; neither changes **F** or **G**. See **C.3.A Guard\_XContext\_Typed**.

---

### 8.2 · Narrowing after mapping (best practice)  \[I]

If a bridge’s loss notes indicate material mismatch (dropped invariants, collapsed subkinds):

* **Narrow the mapped Scope** to areas where those losses are benign.
* **Or** introduce an **adapter** (plus evidence) that restores the needed properties in the target Context.
* Document the decision; the penalties still land in **R**.

---

### 8.3 · Typical Cross‑context patterns (manager’s catalog)  \[I]

* **Name‑level overlap only (low `CL^k`).**
  Expect significant Ψ penalty. Limit quantification, add local checks, or refuse reuse until the kind mapping is improved.

* **Up‑to‑iso mapping (high `CL^k`).**
  Often seen for K3 kinds. Ψ penalty is small; treat as “shape‑preserving” transfer. Still apply the appropriate **Φ(CL)** for Scope.

* **Mask‑to‑subkind evolution.**
  If receivers repeatedly use the same **RoleMask** to make a transfer safe, promote it to an explicit **subkind** and update the bridge to preserve that link.

---

### 8.4 · Decision pattern (fast path)  \[I]

1. **Typed pre‑check:** `k_A ⊑ k_B` (same Context) **or** `KindBridge(k_A → k′_B)` with acceptable **`CL^k`**.
2. **Scope coverage:** `translate(Scope_A)` covers `TargetSlice_B`.
3. **Apply penalties:** **Φ(CL\_scope)** and **Ψ(`CL^k`)** to **R**.
4. **Freshness:** windows/decay for all bound evidence.
5. **Publish:** a short “Bridge and Loss Notes” box; include any **narrowing** or **adapters** used.

---

## 9 · Authoring guidance (engineers‑managers)  \[I]

### 9.1 · When to mint a `U.Kind`  \[I]

Create a Kind when:

* multiple claims refer to the **same “aboutness”** using unstable labels;
* you need **subkinds** (refinement) or repeated **RoleMasks**;
* different Contexts must **map** this “aboutness” via bridges;
* you need to **quantify** over a population (and plan variant coverage) instead of over a single exemplar.

Avoid creating a Kind for **one‑off** instance references—prefer a clear **K0** facet or just a literal exemplar in the claim.

---

### 9.2 · Writing a **KindSignature** (and picking **F**)  \[I]

* Start with a concise **intent**: the invariants/constraints that make membership meaningful.
* Aim for **F4** (predicate‑like) if the kind is intended for reuse; rise to **F7+** only where proof‑grade is justified.
* Use **observable** terms (no “latest”); if a contract matters, **name its version**.
* If defining a Kind reveals systematic **narrowings** in use, introduce explicit **subkinds** (`⊑`) rather than accumulating opaque masks.

> **Example (sketch).**
> `Kind Vehicle` — intent: “has VIN; has brake system; has propulsion {ICE, EV, Hybrid}; …” (F4 predicates).
> Subkind: `PassengerCar ⊑ Vehicle`.
> RoleMask: `Vehicle@ABSRequired` for processes that demand ABS (deterministic constraints; candidates for promotion to subkind if widely reused).

---

### 9.3 · Setting the **AT** facet (K0…K3)  \[I]

Use **AT** to **aim effort**, not to gate:

* **K0**: instance/cohort — focus **R** on the TargetSlice; don’t over‑formalize.
* **K1**: behavioral pattern — clarify contracts; plan ΔF (F3→F4).
* **K2**: formal class — invest in F4–F7; plan **variant coverage** across subkinds in **R**.
* **K3**: up‑to‑iso — expect high‑quality bridges; consider F7–F9 for critical invariants.

Never treat **AT** as “wider/narrower” **G**.

---

### 9.4 · Writing a typed claim (with USM blocks)  \[I]

**Skeleton.**

* **Kinds used:** `Vehicle` (K2), subkinds `PassengerCar`.
* **Claim scope (G):** `surface∈{dry,wet}; speed≤50; rig=v3; Γ_time=rolling 180d`.
* **Statement:** `∀ x ∈ Extension(Vehicle, TargetSlice) …`
* **Guards:** use **C.3.A Guard\_TypedClaim**; if Cross‑context, add **Guard\_XContext\_Typed** (two‑bridge rule).

**Tip.** Keep **Scope**, **MemberOf definedness**, **F thresholds**, and **freshness** as **separate** guard predicates—the auditor should be able to tick each box independently.

---

### 9.5 · Minimal “Kind card” contents (Context catalog)  \[I]

* **Name** and **intent summary** (KindSignature snippet + **F**).
* **`⊑` links** (parents/children).
* **Examples of `MemberOf@slice`** (what membership looks like in practice).
* **Known RoleMasks** (type, constraints, determinism).
* **Known KindBridges** (source/target Contexts, **`CL^k`**, loss notes, definedness).
* *(Optional)* **AT** facet with one‑line rationale.

---

## 10 · Review & integration guidance  \[I]

### 10.1 · Reviewer’s 8‑point checklist

1. **Named aboutness.** Does the claim state **what** it quantifies over (`U.Kind`)?
2. **Scope explicit.** Is **G** declared (no “domain” placeholders, no implicit “latest”)?
3. **Typed compatibility.** For compositions, do we have `⊑` (same Context) or a **KindBridge**?
4. **RoleMasks.** If used, are they **registered**, **deterministic**, and not masquerading as kinds?
5. **Two‑bridge rule.** For Cross‑context use, do we have **both** Scope Bridge (**CL**) and **KindBridge** (**`CL^k`**)?
6. **Penalties.** Are **Φ(CL)** and **Ψ(`CL^k`)** applied to **R**, not smuggled into F/G?
7. **Freshness.** Are validation/monitoring windows separate from Scope coverage?
8. **Evidence fit.** For class‑level claims, does the test plan cover **subkinds/variants**?

---

### 10.2 · Integrator’s composition playbook (typed first, then scope)

* **Step 1:** Check `k_A ⊑ k_B` (or KindBridge).
* **Step 2:** Compute **Scope\_serial** = `Scope(A) ∩ Scope(B)` (USM).
* **Step 3:** If parallel supports exist, **SpanUnion** them (only where independent).
* **Step 4:** Apply **Φ**/**Ψ** penalties to **R**; enforce freshness.
* **Step 5:** If a **mask** is repeatedly required, consider promoting it to a **subkind**.

---

### 10.3 · Assurance lead: wiring penalties and windows

* Identify channels used: **Scope bridge? KindBridge?**
* Apply **Φ(CL)** and **Ψ(`CL^k`)** to **R** (monotone; higher congruence ⇒ smaller penalty).
* Verify **freshness windows** for all bound evidence (independent of bridges).
* Publish a **one‑box summary**: bridges, levels, loss notes, any narrowing/adapters, net impact on **R**.

---

### 10.4 · Red flags (stop‑the‑line)

* “**We widened G because we reworded the type.**” → **Reject**; redo as subkind/bridge or revise Scope honestly.
* “**Mask equals kind.**” → **Refactor**; register mask properly or promote to subkind.
* “**Cross‑context without KindBridge.**” → **Block**; demand mapping and **`CL^k`**.
* “**No Γ\_time.**” → **Block**; add explicit time policy (point/window/rolling).

---

## 11 · Worked examples (end‑to‑end)  \[I]

+> *Each example shows the typed pre‑check, Scope composition, penalties to **R**, and the managerial decision. Full guard clauses for these scenarios are in **Annex C.3.A**.*

### 11.1 · Cyber‑physical braking policy across labs and plants

**Claim (Lab Context).**
“∀ `x ∈ Vehicle`: brakingDistance(x) ≤ 50 m (dry), ≤ 40 m (wet).”
**Kinds.** `Vehicle` (K2, KindSignature F4); subkind `PassengerCar ⊑ Vehicle`.
**Scope (Lab).** `{surface∈{dry,wet}, speed≤50, rig=v3, Γ_time=rolling 180d}`.

**Reuse at Plant B.**
– **KindBridge:** `Vehicle ↦ TransportUnit` with **`CL^k=2`** (loss: EV subkind collapsed).
– **Scope Bridge:** `Lab → PlantB` with **CL=2** (rig bias ±2 %).
– **Narrowing:** loss notes indicate wet‑surface bias; Plant B **narrows** mapped Scope to temp/adhesion ranges with acceptable bias.

**Decision.**
Typed pre‑check: **OK** via KindBridge. Scope coverage after translate/narrow: **OK**.
Penalties: apply **Φ(2)** and **Ψ(2)** to **R**; freshness windows checked.
**Outcome:** Adopt with reduced **R**; action item: qualify rig v4 to raise CL in the future.

---

### 11.2 · API decision rule with adapter and subkind promotion

**Consumer claim.**
“∀ `x ∈ AuthenticatedRequest`: deny if riskScore(x) ≥ θ ∧ budgetSlack ≤ β.”

**Producer reality.**
Service A emits `Request` (no auth guarantee).
**Option A:** A proves it emits `AuthenticatedRequest` (introduce subkind or strengthen contract).
**Option B:** Insert **adapter** that filters/annotates `Request → AuthenticatedRequest`.

**Typed check.**
Before: no `Request ⊑ AuthenticatedRequest`. After **Option B**: adapter supplies the guarantee; repeated use leads to promoting **mask** to **subkind**.

**Scope.**
API v2.3; Γ\_time = rolling 30 d.
**R.**
No Cross‑context reuse; no Φ/Ψ. Evidence: adapter correctness on the TargetSlice.

**Outcome.**
Adopt via Option B; open task: generalize producer to subkind and remove adapter later.

---

### 11.3 · Clinical dosage rule across jurisdictions (bridge + mask)

**Claim (Hospital X).**
“∀ `x ∈ AdultPatient`: dosage ≤ D per kg for drug M.”
**Kind.** `AdultPatient` (K2, F4).
**Mask.** `AdultPatient@ClinicMask` narrows to the clinic’s cohort (deterministic DOB policy).

**Reuse in Jurisdiction Y.**
– **KindBridge:** `AdultPatient ↦ AdultPerson_Y`, **`CL^k=1`** (18 vs 21 years boundary).
– **Scope Bridge:** coding systems differ (CL depends on mapping quality).
– **Narrowing:** restrict Scope to datasets where DOB granularity supports boundary reconciliation.

**Decision.**
Typed pre‑check via KindBridge: **OK**. Scope coverage after translate/narrow: **OK**.
Penalties: **Φ(CL\_scope)** and **Ψ(1)** applied to **R**.
**Outcome:** Adopt with strong **R** penalty; plan: negotiate a harmonized boundary to raise `CL^k`.

---

### 11.4 · ML fairness constraint with typed quantification

**Claim (Product Context).**
“∀ `x ∈ EligiblePerson`: TPR difference ≤ δ across groups `G`.”

**Kind.** `EligiblePerson` transitions from **K1→K2** as attributes and cohorts are formalized (KindSignature F4).
**Scope.** `{pipeline=P, features=F, Γ_time=rolling 180 d}`.

**Cross‑context use.**
Model team Context has `Resident` with different feature basis.
– **KindBridge:** `EligiblePerson ↦ Resident` with **`CL^k=1`** (feature loss).
– **Scope Bridge:** `pipeline P → P′`, **CL=2**.

**Decision.**
Typed pre‑check **OK** via bridges; mapped Scope **covers** the subset where features align.
Apply **Φ(2)** and **Ψ(1)** to **R**; restrict groups to mapped subset; require monitoring freshness.
**Outcome:** Adopt with reduced **R** and a mitigation note; action items: improve feature mapping and raise KindSignature F.

## 12 · Anti‑patterns & how to fix them  \[I/A]

> *Use this section as a “red flags” sheet in reviews. Each item links to a concrete remedy that preserves F–G–R & USM discipline (F/G/R separation, USM algebra, typed pre‑checks).*

| Anti‑pattern (what goes wrong)                                   | Why it’s wrong (conceptual fault)                                                               | The fix (normative/informative pointers)                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **“We widened G because we reworded the type.”**                 | Confuses **aboutness** (kind) with **applicability** (scope). Abstract wording ≠ broader scope. | Keep typed pre‑check separate (C.3.1 `⊑` or C.3.3 KindBridge). Widen **G** only via **ΔG+** with support (USM A.2.6).                                 |
| **“Kind scope” block attached to a Kind.**                       | Kinds don’t carry Scope; they carry **intent/extent**.                                          | Remove the block. Scope stays on claims/capabilities (USM). If you meant classifier definedness, state it via **K‑07** (C.3.2).                       |
| **Inferring scope from extension size.**                         | **Scope ≠ Extension**; extension is “which instances in a slice,” not “where the claim holds.”  | Keep **G** set‑valued over `U.ContextSlice` (USM). Use `MemberOf` only inside the typed quantifier.                                                   |
| **Mask used as a hidden kind (“just call it the masked kind”).** | Opaque drift; reviewers can’t see constraints.                                                  | Register a **RoleMask** (C.3.4). If reused across guards, **promote to subkind** with `⊑`.                                                            |
| **Cross‑context reuse with only one bridge.**                       | Contexts differ on two characteristics: Scope **and** Kind.                                                   | Apply the **two‑bridge rule**: Scope Bridge (**CL** → Φ) **and** KindBridge (**`CL^k`** → Ψ). Both penalties land in **R**.                           |
| **Using AT (K0…K3) as a gate/threshold.**                        | AT is an **informative facet**, not a Characteristic; gating on AT recreates a G‑ladder.        | Remove AT from guards. Use it only to **aim ΔF/ΔR** and to set **bridge expectations** (C.3.5).                                                       |
| **“Automated execution success proves the type claim.”**                            | Execution success (F5/6) is not proof (F7+); also confuses **R** with **F**.                    | If you need proof‑grade properties, raise **F** for the claim/KindSignature (C.2.3) or restrict the claim. Keep **R** as evidence freshness/coverage. |

## 13 · Governance & conformance pull‑ups  \[A]

> *Contexts adopt Kind‑CAL by meeting the **Context‑level** obligations below. They summarize, not duplicate, the formal requirements in **C.3.1–C.3.5** and **C.3.A**. Use this as an adoption checklist.*

### 13.1 · Context‑level obligations (must‑haves)

1. **Kinds & order.** Maintain a Context catalog of `U.Kind` with an explicit **partial order** `⊑`.
   – Conformance: **C.3.1** (K‑01/K‑02).

2. **Kind signatures (intent).** For each Kind, publish a **KindSignature** with declared **F** (C.2.3).
   – Conformance: **C.3.2** (K‑03/K‑04).

3. **Deterministic membership.** Ensure `MemberOf(e,k,slice)` is **deterministic**; declare any definedness domain.
   – Conformance: **C.3.2** (K‑05/K‑07).

4. **Typed guards.** When a claim quantifies over kinds, guards SHALL use the **typed guard macros** (or equivalents) from **C.3.A**; **Scope coverage** and **typed checks** are separate predicates.

5. **Role masks.** If a local projection is needed, register a **RoleMask** (type: constraint/vocabulary/composite); avoid cloning kinds.
   – Conformance: **C.3.4** (RM‑01…RM‑06).

6. **Two‑bridge rule for Cross‑context use.**
   – **Scope Bridge** (Part B) with **CL** → Φ(CL) to **R**.
   – **KindBridge** (C.3.3) with **`CL^k`** → Ψ(`CL^k`) to **R**.
   – Conformance: **C.3.3** (KB‑01…KB‑10).

7. **Decision records.** For each typed state change, record: **TargetSlice tuple**, typed compatibility outcome (`⊑` or KindBridge), **Scope coverage**, applied **Φ/Ψ** penalties to **R**, and **freshness** checks.

### 13.2 · ESG / Method‑Work template inserts (normative snippets)

* **Kinds used:** list `U.Kind` and any expected **subkinds** or **RoleMasks**.
* **Claim scope (G):** explicit predicates over `U.ContextSlice` inc. **Γ\_time**.
* **Typed guard lines:**
  – same Context: `k_A ⊑ k_B` *checked*.
  – Cross Context: `KindBridge(k_A → k′_B)`, `CL^k ≥ c_k` *checked*.
* **Scope bridge lines:** `Bridge(Context_A → Context_B)`, `CL ≥ c_s` *checked*.
* **Assurance lines:** `Φ(CL)`, `Ψ(CL^k)` applied to **R**; **freshness windows** hold.

### 13.3 · Audits & levels of adoption (informative)

* **USM‑Typed‑Ready.** Catalog exists; `⊑` declared; guard macros installed.
* **USM‑Typed‑Guarded.** All typed claims use **C.3.A** guard shapes; **Γ\_time** explicit; two‑bridge rule enforced.
* **USM‑Typed‑Auditable.** Decision records capture **TargetSlice**, typed checks, bridges, penalties, freshness.
* **USM‑Typed‑Composed.** Compositions use typed pre‑check before Scope algebra; independence justified for **SpanUnion**.

---

## 14 · Migration & editorial impact  \[A]

> *Apply these edits incrementally; you do not need to stop other work. The aim is to eliminate synonym drift, restore F/G/R separation, and make typed reasoning routine.*

### 14.1 · Inventory & refactor (steps)

1. **Inventory** claims that implicitly talk about “things” (vehicles, requests, accounts, cohorts…).
2. **Name kinds** for recurring “aboutness”; start at **K1**; promote to **K2** as invariants stabilize.
3. **Extract KindSignature** (aim **F4**); declare **F**.
4. **Refactor claims** to typed quantification: `∀ x ∈ Extension(k, slice) …` plus **Scope (G)** predicates.
5. **Publish bridges** where reuse is Cross‑context: Scope Bridge (**CL**) and KindBridge (**`CL^k`**) with loss notes; wire penalties **Φ/Ψ** to **R**.
6. **Normalize masks**: register RoleMasks; if reused, promote to subkinds (`⊑`).

### 14.2 · Edits to other parts (normative redirects, no new math)

* **A.2.6 (USM).**
  – Add “no Scope on kinds” note.
  – In typed examples, show `MemberOf` definedness + Scope coverage.
  – Two‑bridge rule for Cross‑context typed reuse.

* **C.2.2 (F–G–R).**
  – Replace any “generality/abstraction” wording with **Claim scope (G)**.
  – Before scope composition, require typed pre‑check (`⊑` or KindBridge).
  – Distinguish penalties: **Φ(CL)** vs **Ψ(`CL^k`)** → both to **R**.

* **C.2.3 (F).**
  – Add note: **KindSignature** has its own **F**; claim‑level F remains by weakest‑link.

* **Part B (Bridges).**
 – Introduce **KindBridge** with **`CL^k`**, monotone order preservation, loss notes; determinism.
 – Chaining uses **min** of levels (weakest‑link) **for both** **CL** (Scope bridges) **and** **`CL^k`** (KindBridges).


* **Role‑CAL.**
  – Add **RoleMask** for kinds; determinism; promotion rule to subkind when reused.

* **Compose‑CAL.**
  – Add typed pre‑check before Scope algebra; forbid “type‑by‑scope”.

* **Part E (Lexicon).**
  – Add: `U.Kind`, `U.SubkindOf (⊑)`, `KindSignature`(+F), `Extension`, `MemberOf`, `U.RoleMask`, **KindBridge**, `CL^k`, **AT (kinds, facet)**.
  – Mark as **legacy aliases** (not characteristic names): *generality (as ladder), kind scope, validity (as characteristic), capability envelope*; redirect to **Claim/Work scope** or **Kind** entries.

### 14.3 · Backwards compatibility

* Historical prose may keep legacy words. **Guards, conformance text, and state assertions** MUST use the Kind‑CAL/USM vocabulary and guard shapes.
* When annotating older records, add a small “typed note” box: **Kinds**, **Scope**, **Bridges (CL/`CL^k`)**, **loss notes**, **penalties to R**.

---

## 15 · Extended rationale & design notes  \[I]

> *This section explains the design choices that keep Kind‑CAL compact and interoperable with F–G–R & USM without drifting into tooling or technology stacks.*

### 15.1 · Why **no Scope on kinds**

Scope answers **“where the claim holds”** (set of Context slices, USM); kinds answer **“what the claim is about”**. Putting Scope on kinds would either (a) duplicate claim Scope, or (b) smuggle applicability into a classifier. We prevent both by: **intent/extent on kinds** (C.3.2), **Scope on claims/capabilities** (USM).

### 15.2 · Why **two bridges** (Scope vs Kind)

Contexts diverge along **context** (contracts, parameters, time) and **classification** (what counts as a member). A single bridge hides which characteristic is mismatched. Two explicit bridges keep fixes targeted: **ΔG / narrowing** for context misfit; **subkind/adapter** for classification misfit. Both risks land in **R** as separate penalties (**Φ/Ψ**).

### 15.3 · Why **AT is a facet**

AT (K0…K3) improves **planning** (ΔF/ΔR, bridge style) and **navigation** without introducing new algebra. Making AT a Characteristic would recreate a “G‑ladder,” blur applicability with abstraction, and invite gating on AT. As a facet, AT remains helpful but **toothless in math**, which is precisely what we want.

### 15.4 · Why **RoleMask** and not “clone a kind”

Operational tweaks (extra constraints, local aliases) are real but temporary. Cloning kinds creates drift and duplicate bridges. **RoleMask** documents the tweak **without breaking identity**; promotion to subkind occurs when practice stabilizes. This keeps catalogs small and bridges honest.

### 15.5 · Fit with **Compose‑CAL** and **LOG‑CAL**

Typed pre‑checks (same‑Context `⊑` or KindBridge) act like **port compatibility** before any Scope arithmetic. LOG‑CAL benefits from explicit quantification `∀ x : Kind` with substitution rules aligned to `⊑`. Neither alters F/G/R algebra; they prevent category mistakes before we do trust math.

### 15.6 · CT2R lens (intuition)

A **KindBridge** behaves like a **functor** that (approximately) preserves structure between Contexts; **`CL^k`** is a practical knob for “how functorial” it is. At **K3** (up‑to‑iso), this is literal: we expect bridges to preserve equivalences, hence higher `CL^k` and smaller Ψ penalties.

## 15bis · Rationale (Part E form)  \[I]

**Problem.** (recap)
— Authors conflate *aboutness* with *applicability*, widening G by abstract wording.
— Cross‑context reuse drifts semantically without declared mappings or risk accounting.
— Planning misfires: over‑formalization for instance claims; under‑testing for class claims.
— Unsafe compositions when aboutness is implicit.

**Forces.** (recap)
— Local freedom vs global sense; minimality vs utility; intent vs extent; typed discipline vs F–G–R; abstraction vs applicability.

**Decision (C.3‑D1…D7).**
— D1: `U.Kind` is intensional and context‑local (`⊑` partial order).
— D2: Separate intent (KindSignature + F) and extent (Extension/MemberOf@slice).
— D3: No Scope on kinds (Scope lives with claims/capabilities via USM).
— D4: Typed reuse is explicit: KindBridge + `CL^k`, penalties route to **R** only.
— D5: Local adaptation via RoleMask; promote stable masks to subkinds.
— D6: AT (K0…K3) as **facet**, not a Characteristic; never used in guards.
— D7: Guard shapes: typed pre‑check → scope coverage → penalties/freshness.

**Consequences.**
(+) Predictable Cross‑context reuse: two‑bridge rule, separate penalties (Φ/Ψ) to **R**.  
(+) Manager‑friendly planning: AT guides ΔF/ΔR; typed pre‑check blocks category mistakes.  
(+) Clean F–G–R discipline: no “G‑ladder,” no hidden scope inside classifiers.  
(−) Editorial discipline required: no “Kind scope”; masks must be cataloged; promote when stable.  
(−) Initial bridge authoring cost; mitigated by loss‑notes and reuse.

**Alternatives considered.**
— *Global U.Type*: rejected as either too thin or too prescriptive across Contexts.  
— *“Kind scope” in USM*: rejected; duplicates/obscures Scope vs Extension split.

**Known uses.**
— §11.1 (cyber‑physical braking); §11.2 (API with adapter); §11.3 (clinical dosage); §11.4 (ML fairness).  
— ESG guard shapes in **C.3.A**; typed pre‑check in Compose‑CAL (§7.2.4).

**Related patterns.**
A.2.6 (USM), C.2.2 (F–G–R), C.2.3 (F), Part B (Bridges), Role‑CAL, Compose‑CAL, C.3.1–C.3.5, C.3.A.

## 16 · Quick reference for managers  \[I]

### 16.1 · 10‑minute start

1. Name the **Kind** your claim talks about.
2. Write **Scope (G)** as slice predicates (with **Γ\_time**).
3. If composing, check **`⊑`** or **KindBridge** first.
4. Use the **typed guard macro** (C.3.A).
5. Route bridge levels to **R** (Φ/Ψ); check freshness.

### 16.2 · 30‑day rollout plan

Week 1: Inventory & name Kinds (K1); adopt guard macros.
Week 2: Draft **KindSignature** for the top 5 Kinds (aim **F4**); register masks.
Week 3: Wire **two‑bridge rule** into ESG; add CL/`CL^k` lines to decision templates.
Week 4: Promote repeated masks to subkinds; publish first **KindBridge** records with loss notes.

# C.3.1 · **U.Kind & SubkindOf (Core)**  \[A]

> **One‑line summary.** Defines **`U.Kind`** as a **minimal, context‑local intensional carrier** for “what a claim is about,” and **`U.SubkindOf (⊑)`** as a **partial order** over kinds. **Kinds do not carry Scope.** Scope remains on **claims/capabilities** (USM). This core pattern supplies only identity, locality, and ordering; **intent & membership** (`KindSignature`, `Extension/MemberOf`) are specified in **C.3.2**, bridges & congruence in **C.3.3**, masks in **C.3.4**, and the AT facet in **C.3.5**.

## ## 0 · Status, Placement & Dependencies

**Status.** Normative architheory in **Part C**. Identifier **C.3.1**.
**Audience.** Engineering managers, architects, assurance leads.

**Dependencies.**

* **A.2.6 USM (Unified Scope Mechanism).** *Scope* is a set‑valued characteristic over `U.ContextSlice` on **claims/capabilities**; algebra: `∈` (membership), `∩` (intersection), `SpanUnion` (union across independent lines), `translate` (scope mapping). 
* **C.2.2 F–G–R.** F = formality of expression; **G = Claim scope**; R = assurance/evidence; weakest‑link for F/R; CL penalties feed **R**, not **F/G**.
* **C.2.3 U.Formality (F).** Ordinal F0…F9; no arithmetic; applies to all content, including Kind signatures (defined in **C.3.2**).
* **Part B Bridges & CL.** Generic (scope) bridges and CL; **Kind bridges** are specialized in **C.3.3**.

**Non‑goals.**

* No data governance or repository/notation mandates.
* No membership or signature semantics here (defined in **C.3.2**).
* No Cross‑context mapping/congruence here (defined in **C.3.3**).
* No role/mask mechanics here (defined in **C.3.4**).
* No AT facet mechanics here (defined in **C.3.5**).

## 1 · Purpose & Audience

This pattern gives **one small, stable vocabulary** to say *what* a claim ranges over (its **aboutness**) without entangling that with *where it applies* (Scope) or *how well it is supported* (R). For managers:

* It prevents the costly mistake “more abstract wording ⇒ wider scope.”
* It enables **typed composition** (you cannot combine claims about incompatible “things”).
* It keeps **Scope** and **Assurance** math unchanged and predictable.

---

## 2 · Context

across Contexts, “type” means OWL class, SHACL shape, code type, BORO category, etc. A **neutral, minimal** object is needed to name *the kind of entities* a claim quantifies over **without** importing a full type system or altering USM. **`U.Kind`** fills that role; **ordering** between kinds captures “is‑a/refines” relationships a Context relies on.

---

## 3 · Problem

1. **Scope–Type conflation.** Teams broaden G by “abstracting” prose, not by adding supported slices.
2. **Unsafe composition.** Claims are joined though they talk about different “things.”
3. **Cross‑context drift.** Without an explicit core notion of kind, bridges blur aboutness vs applicability.

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Minimality vs utility**      | Keep the core tiny yet sufficient for composition and governance.         |
| **Locality vs reuse**          | Kinds are context‑local, but projects reuse claims across Contexts via bridges. |
| **Aboutness vs applicability** | Ordering should not leak into Scope; kinds must not carry G.              |

## 5 · Solution — Core Objects (overview)

* **`U.Kind`** — a **context‑local intensional** object naming a “kind of thing” claims may quantify over.
* **`U.SubkindOf (⊑)`** — a **partial order** on kinds (reflexive, transitive, antisymmetric). `k₁ ⊑ k₂` reads “`k₁` refines `k₂`.”

> **No Scope on kinds.** Scope is for **claims/capabilities** (USM). Kinds supply **aboutness only**; **membership** and **signature** live in **C.3.2**.

---

## 6 · Norms & Invariants (normative)

**C3.1‑K‑01 (Partial order).** `U.SubkindOf (⊑)` **SHALL** be a **partial order** on `U.Kind`: reflexive, transitive, antisymmetric. Editors **SHALL** document any Context‑specific meets/joins if they supply them (optional).

**C3.1‑K‑02 (No Scope on kinds).** A `U.Kind` **MUST NOT** carry a Scope value. Scope lives with **claims** (`U.ClaimScope` = **G**) and **capabilities** (`U.WorkScope`) per **A.2.6**.
*Rationale pointer:* see **C.3.2** for the **intent/extent vs Scope** split.

**C3.1‑K‑03 (Identity & locality).** A `U.Kind` is **context‑local**. Cross‑context mapping of kinds is handled by **KindBridge** (see **C.3.3**); such mapping **MUST NOT** be conflated with Scope bridging.

**C3.1‑K‑04 (Naming).** A Context **SHALL** assign stable identifiers to kinds and **SHOULD** catalog parent/child `⊑` links. Synonyms/aliases **SHALL** point to the canonical kind id.

**C3.1‑K‑05 (Separation of concerns).** This core **does not** define kind intent or membership; those are specified in **C.3.2** (`KindSignature` with its own F; `Extension/MemberOf` and determinism).

---

## 7 · Interactions (informative)

* **With USM (A.2.6).** Guards that quantify over a kind use **two** predicates: “Scope covers TargetSlice” (USM) **and** whatever **membership** predicate is defined for the kind (see **C.3.2**). Kinds themselves carry **no Scope**.
* **With F–G–R (C.2.2).** This pattern does not alter the triple; typed checks happen **before** scope algebra, preventing invalid compositions.
* **Order of checks reference.** See **Annex C.3.A §5 (E‑01)** for the normative evaluation order: typed compatibility first, then Scope coverage, then penalties to **R** and freshness.
* **With Formality (C.2.3).** A **KindSignature** (C.3.2) declares its **F**; claims retain their own F via weakest‑link.
* **With Bridges (Part B).** Use **KindBridge** (C.3.3) for aboutness; use **Scope Bridge** (Part B) for applicability. Penalties land in **R** via different channels.

---

## 8 · Authoring & Review (informative)

**When to mint a kind.**
Mint a `U.Kind` when claims repeatedly quantify over “the same sort of thing” and you need: (i) safe composition, (ii) clear Cross‑context mapping, (iii) a place to collect invariants (in **C.3.2**).

**Don’t over‑mint.**
If a local constraint is temporary or purely procedural, prefer a **RoleMask** (C.3.4) over a new subkind.

**Review prompts.**

1. Does the draft introduce a new *aboutness* concept? → consider a kind.
2. Does prose hint at “is‑a” relationships? → capture as `⊑`, not as scope widening.
3. Are authors trying to widen scope by abstracting wording? → stop; widen **G** only via **ΔG** (USM) with support.

---

## 9 · Examples (informative, technology‑neutral)

1. **Vehicle/PassengerCar.**
   Mint `Kind Vehicle`. Later add `PassengerCar ⊑ Vehicle`. Claims about **Vehicle** may be reused by narrowing to **PassengerCar** without touching **G**. Scope remains an independent predicate over `U.ContextSlice`.

2. **Request/AuthenticatedRequest.**
   If multiple policies speak about “authenticated requests,” declare `AuthenticatedRequest ⊑ Request`. Do **not** widen G to compensate for missing authentication; either change the producer’s kind or insert an adapter (C.3.2/C.3.4) while keeping G honest.

| **C3.1‑K‑05** | **No intent/membership** in this core; refer to **C.3.2** for `KindSignature` and `Extension/MemberOf`. |

---

## 11 · Rationale (informative)

**Why a tiny core?**
Contexts differ wildly in “type” practice. A large, prescriptive core would either (a) force one school’s semantics on all, or (b) become an empty label. The **smallest powerful** core—identity + ordering—gives managers and integrators what they need (safe composition, predictable edits) and leaves intent/membership/bridges/masks to focused sub‑patterns.

**Why “no Scope on kinds”?**
**Scope** (USM) answers “**where** a claim/capability holds” over `U.ContextSlice`. Kinds answer “**what** the claim ranges over.” Blending them recreates the failure mode we are removing (“higher abstraction ⇒ wider scope”). The right split is:

* **Kind**: intensional name + order (`⊑`) *(this pattern)*; intent & membership *(C.3.2)*.
* **Scope**: set of context slices *(A.2.6)*.
* **Assurance**: evidence & penalties *(C.2.2 / Part B)*.

# C.3.2 · **KindSignature (+F) & Extension/MemberOf**  \[A]

> **One‑line summary.** Specifies the **intent and extent** of kinds: (**i**) a **`KindSignature(k)`** (the intensional definition of kind `k`) that **declares its own Formality F**; (**ii**) an **`Extension(k, slice) ⊆ U.EntitySpace(slice)`** and the **membership predicate** `MemberOf(e, k, slice)` that are **deterministic per `U.ContextSlice`**; (**iii**) **monotonicity** of extension under `SubkindOf`; (**iv**) a **definedness policy** that fails **closed** outside its domain. **Kinds still carry no Scope** (that rule lives in C.3.1); Scope stays on **claims/capabilities** (USM). This pattern gives managers and reviewers the **observable basis** to check “what counts as a member here and now” without entangling applicability (G) or assurance (R).

---

## 0 · Status, Placement & Dependencies

**Status.** Normative architheory in **Part C**. Identifier **C.3.2**.
**Audience.** Engineering managers, architects, assurance leads, editors.

**Depends on.**

* **C.3.1** (*U.Kind & SubkindOf Core*): kinds are context‑local; `⊑` is a partial order; kinds carry **no Scope**.
* **A.2.6 USM** (*Context slices & Scopes*): Claim scope (G) and Work scope live on claims/capabilities; algebra `∈` (membership), `∩` (intersection), `SpanUnion` (union across independent lines), `translate` (scope mapping).
* **C.2.3 U.Formality (F)**: ordinal F0…F9; no arithmetic; weakest‑link composition applies to content that depends on the signature.
* **C.2.2 F–G–R**: assurance calculus; CL penalties feed **R**, not **F/G**.
* **Part B (Scope Bridges & CL).** CL (scope congruence) and scope translation live in Part B/USM; **kind‑congruence `CL^k`** and kind mapping live in **C.3.3** (KindBridge).

**Non‑goals.**

* No Scope semantics here (USM); no bridge semantics here (C.3.3).
* No repository/notation mandates; this is concept‑level, not tooling.

## 1 · Purpose & Audience

This pattern makes **aboutness testable** in a Context:

* Authors get a place to write **what defines a kind** (`KindSignature`) and at **what rigor (F)**.
* Reviewers can ask **deterministic** questions: *“Given this `TargetSlice`, which entities are in `k`?”*
* Managers can plan **ΔF** (raise signature rigor) and **ΔR** (evidence over members) **without** changing **G** (applicability).

**No tooling assumption.** The pattern is **conceptual** and notation‑neutral (no OWL/SHACL/type‑system requirement); it specifies reviewer‑checkable obligations that managers can read in plain language.

## 2 · Context

Different Contexts encode “type” intent differently (predicates, schemas, ontologies, contracts). Regardless of notation, a team must be able to answer, reproducibly: **who belongs to the kind at this slice?** If this is not stable, claims quantified over the kind are unverifiable, bridges are opaque, and composition becomes unsafe.

---

## 3 · Problem

1. **Ambiguous membership.** Membership depends on tacit “latest” states or unwritten defaults.
2. **Signature opacity.** A kind’s definition is scattered; no single place to declare rigor (**F**) or assumptions.
3. **Order violations.** Subkind hierarchies do not guarantee subset behavior in practice.
4. **Scope leakage.** Teams smuggle applicability (G) into kind definitions, recreating G‑ladders by another name.

| **Expressivity vs determinism**    | Rich intent is welcome, but membership must be deterministic given `slice`.                          |
| **Intent vs applicability**        | Define “what counts” (intent/extent) without encoding “where valid” (G).                             |
| **Rigor vs cost**                  | Raising signature F has cost; the framework must support low‑F drafts and high‑F safety cores alike. |

## 5 · Solution — Objects & Contracts (overview)

* **`KindSignature(k)`** — the **intensional** definition of kind `k` in the Context; it **declares `U.Formality`** per C.2.3.
* **`U.EntitySpace(slice)`** — the set (or well‑defined universe) of **entities addressable in a given `U.ContextSlice`**.
* **`Extension(k, slice) ⊆ U.EntitySpace(slice)`** — **which entities** belong to `k` **at** `slice`.
* **`MemberOf(e, k, slice)`** — membership predicate: `e ∈ Extension(k, slice)`.

**Design split.**

* **Intent** lives in **`KindSignature`** (with F).
* **Extent** is **computed per `slice`** via `MemberOf`.
* **Applicability** (where a **claim** holds) remains a **Scope** on the claim (USM) and **MUST NOT** be encoded into `KindSignature`.

## 6 · Norms & Invariants (normative)

> IDs **C3.2‑K‑03…K‑08** correspond to the rules announced in C.3; additional local rules use **C3.2‑S‑\***.

### 6.1 · Signature & Formality

**C3.2‑K‑03 (Signature F).** Every `KindSignature(k)` **SHALL declare `U.Formality`** per C.2.3 (F0…F9).
— *Note:* Raising signature F **does not** automatically raise claim‑level F; claims follow weakest‑link along their **own** support paths.

**C3.2‑K‑04 (Signature change = content change).** Any change to `KindSignature(k)` that **alters membership** (i.e., would change `Extension(k, slice)` for some `slice`) **SHALL** be recorded as a **content change** (Contexts may version kinds).

### 6.2 · Extension & Membership

**C3.2‑K‑05 (Deterministic membership).** For fixed `(k, slice)`, `MemberOf(e, k, slice)` **MUST** be deterministically evaluable **from observable content in `slice`**.
— Implication: **“latest” is forbidden**; `Γ_time` must be explicit on `slice` (A.2.6).
— If a classifier makes external assumptions, they **MUST** be named in `KindSignature`.

**C3.2‑K‑06 (Monotone in `⊑`).** If `k₁ ⊑ k₂`, then for **every** `slice`:
`Extension(k₁, slice) ⊆ Extension(k₂, slice)`.

**C3.2‑K‑07 (Definedness & fail‑closed).** Each Context **MAY** restrict the **domain of definedness** for `MemberOf(–, k, –)` (e.g., only when a contract or dataset is present at a given version). Outside that domain, `MemberOf` **MUST** be treated as **not defined** for guard purposes, and guards **MUST fail closed** (deny). Implementations MAY internally return `False`, but there **MUST** be no path where undefined membership yields implicit success.

**C3.2‑K‑08 (Separation from G).** Guards **SHALL** keep **Scope coverage** (USM) and **membership** **as separate predicates**:
“`U.ClaimScope(Claim) covers TargetSlice` **AND** `MemberOf(?, k, TargetSlice)` is defined/used”.

### 6.3 · Entity space & time

**C3.2‑S‑01 (`U.EntitySpace`).** A Context **SHALL** document what counts as `U.EntitySpace(slice)` (e.g., “rows in dataset D at version v,” “live objects in service S at build b,” “ontology individuals at vocabulary v”). This documentation **MUST** be stable and addressable via the `slice` tuple.
**C3.2‑S‑02 (Time).** `slice` **SHALL** specify **`Γ_time`** (point/window/policy). Membership **MUST NOT** rely on implicit recency. 

`U.EntitySpace(slice)` **MUST NOT** expand implicitly via external defaults or time; its extent is fixed by the `slice` tuple (see **C3.2‑S‑02**).

## 7 · Interactions & Placement (informative)

* **With C.3.1.** Kinds carry identity and `⊑`; **no Scope** on kinds. This pattern adds the **intent/extent** layer under those constraints.
* **With A.2.6 (USM).** A typed claim’s guard normally evaluates, in the order specified by **Annex C.3.A §5 (E‑01)**: (1) typed compatibility, (2) **Scope coverage** at `TargetSlice`, (3) **`MemberOf(?, k, TargetSlice)`** definedness and any instantiation, followed by penalties to **R** and freshness checks. Use **Guard_TypedClaim** / **Guard_TypedJoin** rather than ad‑hoc shapes.
* **With C.2.3 (F).** Signature F influences claims **only if** the claim **depends on** the signature content; weakest‑link min applies along the claim’s support path.
* **With C.3.3 (KindBridge).** When `MemberOf` is computed via a **kind mapping across Contexts**, kind‑congruence `CL^k` contributes a **monotone penalty to **R** only (Ψ(`CL^k`)); **F/G MUST NOT** be adjusted. 
* **With Role‑CAL (C.3.4).** A **RoleMask** may **narrow** membership (context‑local adaptation). Frequent masks that encode stable narrowing **SHOULD** be promoted to subkinds (`⊑`).

## 8 · Authoring & Review Guidance (informative)

### 8.1 · Authoring `KindSignature`

* **Be explicit and observable.** Prefer predicate‑like clauses over prose (“has VIN format …”; “axles ≥ 2”).
* **Bind to versions.** Name contracts/schemas by version; avoid “current.”
* **Declare F honestly.** F3 for controlled narrative is fine in early phases; aim F4+ for durable kinds; consider F7+ for safety‑critical cores.
* **Name assumptions.** If membership requires external conditions (e.g., calibrated rig), put them in the signature.

### 8.2 · Authoring membership

* **Define `U.EntitySpace(slice)`.** Write it down once per Context, make it addressable via the `slice` tuple, and reuse.
* **Determinism first.** No hidden IO, no implicit time; membership must be recomputable from the slice.
* **Document definedness.** If `MemberOf` is undefined without a contract, say so; guards will fail closed.
* **Respect `⊑`.** If you declare `k₁ ⊑ k₂`, verify subset behavior (C3.2‑K‑06).

### 8.3 · Review checklist (10 minutes)

1. Is **signature F** declared? Is the signature sufficient to evaluate membership?
2. Is **`U.EntitySpace(slice)`** documented and addressable?
3. Is **membership deterministic** with explicit `Γ_time` (no “latest”)?
4. If `⊑` links exist, does **subset behavior** hold at sample slices?
5. Are **Scope** and **membership** kept **separate** in guards?
6. Any **Cross‑context** classification? If yes, is **KindBridge** referenced (C.3.3)?

---

## 9 · Worked Examples (informative)

### 9.1 · Vehicle (signature F4) and membership

**KindSignature(Vehicle)** *(F4)*:

* `hasVIN(x)` is true and parseable;
* `axles(x) ≥ 2`;
* `hasBrakeSystem(x)`;
* contracts: `registryAPI v1.4`; `Γ_time` policy: rolling 365 d for registry fields.

**`U.EntitySpace(slice)`**: “records in `registryAPI v1.4` for plant `A` at build `b`, as of `Γ_time`.”
**`Extension(Vehicle, slice)`**: all records satisfying the predicates **in that `slice`**.
**Monotonicity:** `PassengerCar ⊑ Vehicle` ⇒ `Extension(PassengerCar, s) ⊆ Extension(Vehicle, s)`.

### 9.2 · AuthenticatedRequest (definedness & fail‑closed)

**KindSignature(AuthenticatedRequest)** *(F4)*:

* `Request` with `authHeader` present and `authSignature` valid according to `AuthContract v2.3`;
* `Γ_time`: point in time for key validity check.

**Definedness:** `MemberOf(–, AuthenticatedRequest, slice)` is **undefined** if `AuthContract v2.3` is **absent** in `slice` ⇒ guards **fail closed** (C3.2‑K‑07).

### 9.3 · Clinical cohort (low‑F signature; deterministic membership)

**KindSignature(AdultPatient)** *(F3→F4 as it hardens)*:

* `ageYears(x, Γ_time) ≥ N` (jurisdictional N varies; recorded in the Context’s signature note).
* `EntitySpace(slice)`: EHR `ehr‑east v7.5` @ `Γ_time`;
* Membership deterministic if DOB present; undefined otherwise (fail closed).

## 10 · Anti‑patterns & Remedies (informative)

| Anti‑pattern                                         | Why it’s wrong                        | Remedy                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Using “latest” implicitly in membership              | Non‑deterministic; unreproducible     | Require explicit `Γ_time`; treat freshness separately in **R**      |
| Encoding Scope (“only in EU plant”) in the signature | Confuses applicability with aboutness | Move such conditions to **Claim scope (G)**; keep signature general |
| Declaring `k₁ ⊑ k₂` but not ensuring subset behavior | Breaks typed reasoning                | Tighten `KindSignature` or drop the `⊑` link                        |
| Treating RoleMask as a different kind                | Catalog sprawl; hidden semantics      | Keep mask as adaptation; promote to subkind if widely reused        |
| Membership relying on external, unnamed assumptions  | Hidden dependencies; review fatigue   | Name assumptions in the signature; point to contracts/versions      |

---

## 11 · Rationale (informative)

### 11.1 · Why give **F** to `KindSignature`?

Because rigor in the **definition of a kind** materially affects how safely teams can quantify over it. A signature at **F4** (predicate‑like) makes membership checkable in principle; **F7+** (machine‑checked) can support proof‑carrying development. Keeping this **separate from claim‑level F** prevents “signature formalization” from inflating unrelated claims.

### 11.2 · Why **Extension** is not **Scope**

* **Extension** answers: *“Which entities count as `k` **in this slice**?”*
* **Scope (G)** answers: *“In which slices does **this claim** hold?”*
  Blending the two recreates the old failure mode where “more abstract wording” was treated as “wider applicability.” USM already gives the set‑algebra for G; Kind‑CAL supplies the **typed universe** the claim quantifies over.

### 11.3 · Why **determinism** and **fail‑closed**?

Guards must be **reproducible** and **auditable**: same `slice` ⇒ same membership result. If inputs are missing (undefinedness), the safest default is **deny** (fail closed), prompting either a richer slice or a scope/claim change.

# C.3.3 · **KindBridge & CL^k — Cross‑context Mapping of Kinds**  \[A]

> **One‑line summary.** Defines **`KindBridge`** as the normative mechanism for moving **kinds** (their **intent** and selected **subkind‑of** links) between bounded contexts (“Contexts”). A bridge declares **how a source kind maps to a target kind**, which parts of the **`⊑`** order are preserved or collapsed, and publishes a **type‑congruence level `CL^k`** with **loss notes** and a **definedness area**. **`CL^k` penalties apply only to Reliability (R)** when a claim depends on Cross‑context classification; **F** (formality) and **G** (Claim scope) remain unchanged. Scope translation continues to use the **USM Bridge + CL** channel; **KindBridge** is a **separate, parallel channel** for aboutness.

---

## 0 · Status, Placement, Dependencies 

**Status.** Normative architheory in **Part C**. Identifier **C.3.3**.
**Audience.** Engineering managers, architects, assurance leads, editors.

**Depends on.**

* **C.3.1 — U.Kind & SubkindOf (Core):** kinds are context‑local intensional objects; `⊑` is a partial order; kinds **do not carry Scope**.
* **C.3.2 — KindSignature (+F) & Extension/MemberOf:** signature declares its own **F**; membership `MemberOf(e,k,slice)` is **deterministic** per `U.ContextSlice`.
* **A.2.6 — USM (Context slices & Scopes):** Claim scope (**G**) and Work scope live on claims/capabilities; scope bridging and **CL** penalties are defined there.
* **C.2.2 — F–G–R:** weakest‑link; penalties land in **R**, not **F/G**.
* **C.2.3 — U.Formality (F):** signature rigor.

**Non‑goals.**
— No repository/notation mandates; conceptual only.
— No Scope mapping here (that’s USM); **KindBridge** maps **kinds**, not scopes.
— No new arithmetic on `CL^k`; it reuses the **ordinal anchor semantics** of CL (Part B) but applies to kinds.

## 1 · Purpose & Audience

Cross‑context reuse fails in two **orthogonal** ways:

1. **Applicability** (G): *where* the claim holds (handled by USM Scope Bridge).
2. **Aboutness** (Kind): *what* the claim quantifies over (handled by **KindBridge**).

**C.3.3** gives managers an explicit, auditable channel for **(2)**, so a team can say, with evidence: *“`Vehicle` in Lab maps to `TransportUnit` in Plant with `CL^k=2`; the EV subkind collapses; here’s what we lost.”* Guards stay deterministic; assurance math stays clean (penalties in **R** only).

---

## 2 · Context

Contexts use different **classifications**: ontology classes vs shape contracts, regulatory cohorts vs app types, etc. Informal “same‑name” reuse silently mutates aboutness. USM already made scope moves explicit. **KindBridge** does the same for kinds: **declare the mapping**, rate its **congruence**, and capture known **losses**.

---

## 3 · Problem

1. **Semantic drift.** Moving a claim into a target‑context with a different taxonomy changes “what counts” without anyone noticing.
2. **Hidden order breaks.** Subkind relationships invert or vanish; downstream proofs/tests are misapplied.
3. **Entangled channels.** Teams conflate “scope mapping” with “kind mapping,” making it impossible to assign penalties coherently.
4. **Incomputable guards.** “We map it somehow” yields non‑deterministic classification at guard time.

---

## 4 · Forces

| Force                                    | Tension to resolve                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Minimal disclosure vs precision**      | Bridges must be light to write yet precise enough to avoid semantic drift.                      |
| **Local autonomy vs global reuse**       | Each target‑context keeps its vocabulary; reuse requires explicit, reviewable mappings.                   |
| **Typed safety vs agility**              | We need typed compatibility checks without blocking exploratory reuse.                          |
| **Separate channels vs operator burden** | Two channels (Scope & Kind) must be explicit, but guard writers shouldn’t drown in boilerplate. |

---

## 5 · Solution — The **KindBridge** object (overview)

A **KindBridge** connects **source** Context **A** and **target** Context **B** for a set of kinds. It declares:

1. **Mapping of kinds**: either to named target kinds or via **signature translation** rules.
2. **Order preservation**: which `⊑` links are preserved (monotone), which are **collapsed**, and which are **unknown** (not claimed).
3. **Type‑congruence `CL^k`**: reuses the **same anchors/labels** as **CL** (Part B) but applies to kind intent/order (not to Scope). *Gloss:* higher `CL^k` ⇒ closer preservation of kind intent and declared `⊑` links.
4. **Loss notes**: human‑readable list of invariants and subkinds **not preserved**.
5. **Definedness area**: the subset of `U.ContextSlice` characteristics where the mapping is **intended** to be used (e.g., certain contracts/versions).
6. **Determinism**: fixed versions + mapping rules ⇒ deterministic result (no “latest”).

**Effect on assurance.** When a **claim** in B depends on classification that goes through this bridge, **reduce R** by a monotone penalty **Ψ(`CL^k`)**. **Do not** change **F** or **G**.

---

## 6 · Norms & Invariants (normative)

> The following formalize the **KB‑01…KB‑12** rules announced in C.3.

### 6.1 · Subject & Scope of a KindBridge

**KB‑01 (Subject).** A KindBridge **maps**:

* one or more **KindSignature**(s) from source to target; and
* an **explicitly declared subset of `⊑` links** (which it claims to preserve or collapse).

**KB‑02 (No Scope).** A KindBridge **MUST NOT** map Claim/Work scope (**G**). Scope translation uses the **USM Bridge + CL** channel (A.2.6, Part B).

**No blended score.** Congruence for Scope (**CL**) and for Kind (**CL^k**) **MUST NOT** be aggregated into a single “interoperability” score in guards; each channel is assessed and penalized **separately**. See **Annex C.3.A §5 (E‑06)**.


### 6.2 · Declaration & Shape

**KB‑03 (Declaration).** A KindBridge record **SHALL** include:

1. source/target Contexts and vocabulary/contract **versions**;
2. a **kind mapping** per source kind `k`: either a **named** target kind `k′` or a **signature translation rule** that constructs the **target‑context** `KindSignature(k′)` (the result is owned and versioned in the target Context);
3. an **order preservation claim** for any `k₁ ⊑ k₂` it covers: *preserved* / *collapsed* / *unknown*;
4. **`CL^k`** value (using the CL anchor ladder) labeled **“kind‑congruence”**;
5. **loss notes** (non‑preserved invariants, collapsed subkinds, equality quirks);
6. **definedness area** (constraints on `U.ContextSlice` dimensions where the bridge is meant to apply).

**KB‑04 (Determinism & local evaluation).** Given fixed Context versions and mapping rules, **translateₖ** **MUST** be deterministic (no implicit “latest”). After mapping to `k′`, **membership SHALL be evaluated using the target Context’s own `KindSignature(k′)` and `MemberOf(–, k′, –)`**; source‑context membership results **MUST NOT** be reused as truth in guards (they may be cited as evidence in **R**).

### 6.3 · Order & Monotonicity

**KB‑05 (Monotone order).** If the bridge claims to **preserve** `k₁ ⊑ k₂`, then in the target Context **`translateₖ(k₁) ⊑′ translateₖ(k₂)`** **MUST** hold.
**KB‑06 (No inversions).** The bridge **MUST NOT** assert preserved links that **invert** order. If real‑world constraints force reversal, the link **MUST** be marked **not preserved** with a **loss note**.
**KB‑07 (Collapse semantics).** Marking a link as **collapsed** is allowed (two subkinds mapped to one target kind), but the record **SHALL** list the merged subkinds and any properties thereby lost.

### 6.4 · Congruence & Assurance

**KB‑08 (Anchor reuse & AT neutrality).** **`CL^k`** reuses the **ordinal anchor semantics** of CL (Part B) but applies **to kinds**. Editors **SHALL** label it explicitly as **kind‑congruence** to avoid confusion with Scope CL. **KindBridge records MUST NOT compute or alter KindAT (C.3.5 AT‑04); AT is editorial and independent of `CL^k`.**
**KB‑09 (Effect on R only).** When a claim in the target Context depends on `MemberOf(–, translateₖ(k), TargetSlice)`, a **monotone penalty `Ψ(CL^k)`** **SHALL** reduce **R** (alongside any `Φ(CL)` penalty from the Scope Bridge). Implementations **MUST NOT** adjust **F or G** due to `CL^k`.
**KB‑10 (Chaining).** For a chain of bridges, **effective `CL^k` = min** of the links (weakest‑link).

### 6.5 · Loss Notes & Definedness

**KB‑11 (Loss notes).** Bridges **SHALL** publish human‑readable **loss notes**: which invariants of `KindSignature` are **not preserved**, which subkinds are **collapsed**, and any **higher‑equality** caveats (e.g., up‑to‑iso only).
**KB‑12 (Definedness & guard use).** The bridge’s **definedness area** **SHALL** be stated. Guards **MUST fail closed** outside it (i.e., if a classification relies on the bridge where it is not defined, the guard denies use).

---

## 7 · Interactions (informative)

### 7.1 · With USM Scope bridges (two channels)

When using a claim across Contexts, expect **two concurrent bridges**:

* **Scope Bridge (USM)**: maps **G**; publishes **CL**; penalty **Φ(CL)** to **R**.
* **KindBridge (this pattern)**: maps **kinds**; publishes **`CL^k`**; penalty **Ψ(`CL^k`)** to **R**.

**Discipline:** compute both; **do not** collapse them into one “interoperability score.”

 See **Annex C.3.A §5 (E‑01)** for the normative evaluation order in guards.

### 7.2 · With membership (C.3.2)

After mapping `k` to `k′ = translateₖ(k)`, the **target Context** evaluates membership **as usual**: `MemberOf(e, k′, TargetSlice)`. If the bridge provides a **signature translation**, that definition becomes the **local** `KindSignature(k′)` (versioned per target Context policy).

### 7.3 · With Role masks (C.3.4)

If a claim uses a **RoleMask(k)** across Contexts, you need:

* a **KindBridge** for `k` (`CL^k` + loss notes), and
* a documented **mask adapter** (how mask constraints translate).
  Penalties still land in **R**. If the mask’s effect is stable and widely reused, consider promoting it to a **subkind** on the target side.

### 7.4 · With guards (Annex C.3.A)

Use the **`Guard_XContext_Typed`** macro (Annex C.3.A), which requires **both bridges** and applies **both penalties** to **R**:

* find Scope bridge (CL≥threshold), translate **G**, check coverage;
* find KindBridge (`CL^k≥threshold`), translate **kind**, check **membership definedness**;
* apply **Φ(CL)** and **Ψ(`CL^k`)** to **R**; keep **F/G** untouched.

---

## 8 · Authoring, Review & Rating Guidance (informative)

### 8.1 · Authoring a KindBridge

* **Start narrow & honest.** Declare only the kinds and `⊑` links you **actually preserve**; mark the rest **unknown**.
* **Prefer named targets.** If the target already has a suitable kind, map to it; use **signature translation** only when necessary, and list what’s preserved vs weakened vs dropped.
* **Write loss notes in plain language.** Example: “EV vs ICE subkinds collapsed; battery‑health invariants dropped.”
* **Fix the definedness area.** Bind to target contracts/versions and any environment selectors essential to classification.
* **Assign `CL^k` from exemplars.** Calibrate on concrete counter‑examples and preserved properties; resist optimistic ratings.

### 8.2 · Review playbook (10 minutes)

1. **Two bridges present?** Scope Bridge **and** KindBridge?
2. **Order claims honest?** Any `⊑` inversions? Collapses disclosed?
3. **`CL^k` plausible?** Based on preserved properties, not name similarity?
4. **Loss notes present?** Will they force narrowing of Scope or extra tests?
5. **Definedness area clear?** Guard will **fail closed** outside it?
6. **Penalties wired to R?** No hidden tweaks to **F/G**?

### 8.3 · Rating `CL^k` (rules of thumb)

* **High `CL^k`**: signature equivalence or **up‑to‑iso**; `⊑` fragment preserved; only cosmetic losses.
* **Medium `CL^k`**: some invariants weakened; selected subkinds collapsed; order preserved on critical path.
* **Low `CL^k`**: name‑only correspondences; properties diverge; order not preserved. Expect significant **R** penalty and/or adapters.

---

## 9 · Worked Examples (informative)

### 9.1 · Vehicle → TransportUnit (manufacturing)

**Source kind:** `Vehicle` (K2, signature F4).
**target Context:** `PlantB`, kind `TransportUnit` exists.

**KindBridge:**

* `Vehicle ↦ TransportUnit`; **order**: preserves `PassengerCar ⊑ Vehicle`; **collapses** `EV ⊑ Vehicle` into `TransportUnit` (no EV subkind).
* **`CL^k=2`** (mid); **loss notes:** “battery‑health invariants not carried”; **definedness:** only for `registryAPI v1.4`, `Γ_time` in last 365 d.

**Use:** Claim quantified over `Vehicle` crosses to `PlantB`.
**Guards:** scope bridge CL=2 (rig bias); kind bridge `CL^k=2`; both penalties reduce **R**. **F/G** unchanged.

### 9.2 · AuthenticatedRequest across services (software)

**Source kind:** `AuthenticatedRequest` defined by `AuthContract v2.3`.
**target Context:** `Frontend` with different auth header scheme.

**KindBridge:** signature translation (`authHeader` → `x‑auth`), preserves “signature valid” property; **`CL^k=3`** (high).
**Loss notes:** none; **definedness:** only where `AuthContract v2.3` is in scope.

**Effect:** Rules quantified over `AuthenticatedRequest` can be reused; **R** penalty small (Ψ(3) near 1). Scope remains independent (API v2.3).

### 9.3 · AdultPatient across jurisdictions (clinical)

**Source kind:** `AdultPatient` (≥ 18 at `Γ_time`).
**target Context:** `JurisdictionY` uses ≥ 21.

**KindBridge:** `AdultPatient ↦ AdultPerson_Y` with boundary mismatch; **`CL^k=1`**.
**Loss notes:** “Boundary 18 vs 21; map narrows to ≥ 21”.
**Guard:** Require **mask adapter** or **narrow Scope** to cohorts where DOB is known and ≥ 21. **R** penalty strong; **F/G** remain as declared.

# C.3.4 · **RoleMask — Contextual Adaptation of Kinds (without cloning)**  \[A]

> **One‑line summary.** Defines **`U.RoleMask(kind, Context)`** as a **context‑local adaptation** of a `U.Kind` that (a) adds **constraints** and/or **vocabulary bindings**, and (b) may **narrow** membership **deterministically** within a `U.ContextSlice`, **without creating a new kind**. RoleMasks are catalogued, versioned, and guard‑addressable; frequent, stable constraint masks **SHOULD be promoted** to explicit **subkinds**. Cross‑context use of a RoleMask requires a **KindBridge** (for kinds) and, when needed, a **MaskAdapter** (for mask constraints). All penalties route to **R**; **F/G** remain unchanged.

---

## 0 · Status, Placement, Dependencies 

**Status.** Normative architheory in **Part C**. Identifier **C.3.4**.
**Audience.** Engineering managers, architects, reviewers, editors.

**Depends on.**

* **C.3.1 — U.Kind & SubkindOf (Core):** kinds are intensional; `⊑` is a partial order; kinds **carry no Scope**.
* **C.3.2 — KindSignature (+F) & Extension/MemberOf:** signature F; deterministic `MemberOf(e,k,slice)`; `EntitySpace(slice)`.
* **C.3.3 — KindBridge & CL^k:** Cross‑context kind mapping; `CL^k` penalties → **R** only.
* **A.2.6 — USM (Context slices & Scopes):** Claim/Work scope (**G**) over `U.ContextSlice`; bridges and **CL** for scope.
* **C.2.2 — F–G–R; C.2.3 — U.Formality (F).**

**Non‑goals.**
— No repository/notation mandates; conceptual only.
— RoleMask is **not** a governance tier, data policy, or “mini‑type system.”
— RoleMask does **not** redefine Scope; context conditions belong to **USM**.

## 1 · Purpose (manager’s view)

Teams often need a **local projection** of a widely used kind:

* **Constraint:** “For our procedure, take `Vehicle` **with ABS** only.”
* **Vocabulary:** “Here, `AuthHeader` is called `X‑Auth`.”

If each team clones a fresh kind, catalogs fragment and bridges multiply. **RoleMask** is the disciplined alternative: **keep the kind identity**, apply **declared constraints and bindings**, and make the mask **first‑class** (registered, versioned, guard‑addressable). When a mask becomes stable “de‑facto subkind,” **promote** it to `⊑`.

**Benefits:** fewer near‑duplicates, cleaner Cross‑context reuse, deterministic guards, and auditable narrowing instead of hand‑wavy “this is the version we mean.”

---

## 2 · Context

Kinds (C.3.1/3.2) name **what** claims quantify over; USM (A.2.6) governs **where** claims hold. In practice, procedures need **local tailoring** of kinds for a role/process (compliance profile, product line, cohort). RoleMask gives that tailoring **without** mutating aboutness (Kind) or applicability (Scope).

---

## 3 · Problem

1. **Kind sprawl.** Teams mint near‑duplicate kinds (“Account\_PCI”, “Account\_Ledger”), and alignment decays.
2. **Hidden constraints.** Informal “we only accept …” statements leak into prose; guards can’t check them deterministically.
3. **Scope conflation.** Contextual requirements (jurisdiction, API version) get smuggled into “type” talk, blurring Scope vs Kind.
4. **Cross‑context fragility.** Masks don’t travel unless their constraints are mapped; teams reuse names and hope.

---

## 4 · Forces

| Force                                   | Tension to resolve                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Local specialization vs common core** | Need Context‑specific tailoring **without forking** kinds.                                                      |
| **Expressivity vs determinism**         | Masks must express real constraints **and** be **deterministically checkable** at guard time.                |
| **Context vs entity constraints**       | Conditions over **ContextSlice** (Scope) vs conditions over **entities** (membership) must be split cleanly. |
| **Reuse vs proliferation**              | Encourage reuse and promotion to subkind when stable; avoid a mask zoo.                                      |

---

## 5 · Solution — **RoleMask** (overview)

A **RoleMask** is a **named, versioned binding** `U.RoleMask(kind, Context)` that:

1. **Adds constraints** (entity‑level predicates only),
2. **Binds vocabulary/notation** (aliases, field maps) for the Context/process,
3. **May declare context expectations** (selectors over `U.ContextSlice`, e.g., jurisdiction, API version). **These are enforced via USM Scope guards** (A.2.6) and **do not** change mask membership.
4. **May narrow membership**: `Extension_mask(k, s) ⊆ Extension(k, s)` (entity‑level narrowing only),
5. **Never creates a new kind**; identity stays with `k`.
6. **Is guard‑addressable** and **deterministic** (no “latest”).

**Mask types (declared):**

* **Constraint mask** — adds constraints; may narrow membership;
* **Vocabulary mask** — aliases only; no membership change;
* **Composite mask** — both.

**Separation discipline.**

* **Entity‑level predicates** (e.g., “hasABS(x)”) → **mask membership** (narrowing).
* **Context conditions** (e.g., “jurisdiction=EU”, “API=v2.3”) → **USM Scope** guards (intersection), **not** mask membership.
  Masks **may carry both kinds** of information, but guards must route them into the **right channel**.

---

## 6 · Norms & Invariants (normative)

> The following formalize and expand **RM‑01…RM‑08** referenced in C.3.

### 6.1 · Definition & Shape

**RM‑01 (Definition).** `U.RoleMask(kind, Context)` **SHALL** be a named, versioned record with:
(a) **intent** (what role/procedure the mask serves),
(b) **constraints** (entity‑level predicates; optional context requirements),
(c) **vocabulary/notation bindings**,
(d) **membership narrowing** definition (if any),
(e) **intended guard use**.

**RM‑02 (Not a new kind).** A RoleMask **MUST NOT** introduce a new `U.Kind`. If the domain needs a stable refinement, Contexts **SHALL** publish an explicit `SubkindOf` node (C.3.1).

**RM‑03 (Determinism).** Membership under a mask (if defined) **MUST** be **deterministic** given `slice` and published constraints; implicit “latest” is forbidden.

**RM‑04 (Mask taxonomy).** A mask **SHALL** declare its type: **constraint / vocabulary / composite**.
— **Vocabulary masks** MUST NOT change membership;
— **Constraint/composite masks** MAY narrow membership **only via entity‑level predicates**.

### 6.2 · Separation of channels

**RM‑05 (Context vs entity).**

* Predicates about **entities** (features, attributes) MAY narrow membership: `Extension_mask(k, s) ⊆ Extension(k, s)`.
* Predicates about **ContextSlice** (jurisdiction, contracts, Γ\_time) **SHALL** be enforced via **USM Scope** guards (A.2.6). Masks **MUST NOT** hide Scope requirements inside membership checks.

**Guard routing.** Enforce ContextSlice predicates via **USM Scope** (A.2.6) and entity predicates via **membership**; see **Annex C.3.A §4.3 (Guard_MaskedUse)** and **§5 (E‑01)** for the normative order of checks.

**RM‑06 (Guard use).** Guards **MAY** reference a RoleMask by name **only** if the mask is **registered, versioned, and its constraints are observable** at guard time. Mask names **MUST NOT** be treated as kind synonyms.

### 6.3 · Promotion & Catalog

**RM‑07 (Promotion rule).** A constraint mask reused broadly and stably **SHOULD** be promoted to an explicit **subkind** with a `⊑` link; retire the mask or keep it as a vocabulary wrapper. Editors **SHALL** track promotions in the catalog.

**RM‑08 (Catalog).** Contexts **SHALL** catalog masks (name, version, type, intent, constraints, bindings, examples, related subkinds, known bridges/adapters). Redundant masks **SHOULD** be consolidated.

### 6.4 · Cross‑context use

**RM‑09 (Bridges & adapters).** If a claim uses `MemberOf(–, RoleMask(k), TargetSlice)` across Contexts, the receiving Context **SHALL** require:
(a) a **KindBridge** for `k` (`CLᵏ`, loss notes), and
(b) a **MaskAdapter** — a documented, deterministic mapping of the mask’s **entity‑level constraints** and **vocabulary bindings** into the target Context — whenever those constraints/bindings differ.
Penalties **MUST** route to **R**: `Ψ(CLᵏ)` for kind, plus any **Φ(CL)** for scope bridge.

**RM‑10 (Definedness & fail‑closed).** Mask evaluation **SHALL** state its definedness area; outside it, guards **fail closed**.

---

## 7 · Invariants & Non‑goals (normative)

* **No Scope leakage.** RoleMasks **cannot** widen/narrow **Claim scope (G)**; any context conditions are enforced by USM guards.
* **Identity preservation.** The carrier kind remains `k`; RoleMask does not change aboutness.
* **Weakest‑link unaffected.** RoleMasks do not alter weakest‑link rules on **F/R**; guards **route entity predicates to membership** and **context predicates to USM Scope**.

## 8 · Interactions (informative)

### 8.1 · With Kinds & Subkinds (C.3.1)

Use RoleMask for **procedural tailoring**. If the tailoring becomes **conceptual** and stable, **introduce a subkind** with `⊑` and update references.

### 8.2 · With Membership & Signature (C.3.2)

* **Entity‑level constraints** live in mask membership (deterministic).
* **Signature F** belongs to the kind; raising F in the signature does not auto‑change masks.

### 8.3 · With KindBridge (C.3.3)

A RoleMask crossing Contexts needs **two artifacts**: the KindBridge (`CL^k`, loss notes) and a **MaskAdapter** (how constraints/aliases translate). **R** gets both penalties; **F/G** stay intact. If the adapter systematically narrows membership in the target Context, consider **target‑side subkind**.

### 8.4 · With Guards (Annex C.3.A)

Use **`Guard_MaskedUse`** (Annex **C.3.A §4.3**). It requires:
— mask registration & determinism;
— Scope coverage (A.2.6), **Γ\_time** explicit;
— where Cross‑context: KindBridge (`CL^k`) + MaskAdapter + penalties → **R**.
— **Cross‑context combo.** When masks cross Contexts, use **`Guard_MaskedUse`** together with **`Guard_XContext_Typed`** (Annex **C.3.A §4.5**) so both bridges are checked and both penalties (**Φ(CL)** and **Ψ(CLᵏ)**) land in **R**.
— **Order of checks.** Follow **Annex C.3.A §5 (E‑01)**: typed compatibility first, then Scope coverage, then penalties to **R** and freshness.

## 9 · Anti‑patterns & Remedies (informative)

| Anti‑pattern                                      | Why it’s wrong                         | Remedy                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mask as “new type”                                | Duplicates kind; breaks alignment      | Keep the kind; if stable refinement → publish **subkind** (`⊑`).                      |
| Hiding Scope in mask membership                   | Conflates channels; non‑portable       | Move context conditions to **USM** guards; keep only entity predicates in membership. |
| Unregistered mask in guards                       | Non‑deterministic; un‑auditable        | Register & version the mask; fail closed otherwise.                                   |
| Cross‑context use without KindBridge/MaskAdapter     | Silent semantic drift                  | Require **KindBridge** + **MaskAdapter**; apply `Ψ(CL^k)` and any `Φ(CL)` to **R**.    |
| Mask proliferation (ten masks that mean the same) | Catalog entropy; inconsistent behavior | Consolidate; promote frequently used constraints to **subkinds**.                     |
| Treating mask name as kind synonym                | Hides constraints; invites misuse      | In prose, say “`RoleMask(k, name)`”; in guards, reference mask fields explicitly.     |

## 10 · Worked Examples (informative)

### 10.1 · `Vehicle@ABSOnly` (constraint mask)

**Kind.** `Vehicle` (K2, signature F4).
**Mask.** `Vehicle@ABSOnly` — entity‑level predicate `hasABS(x)=true`; type **constraint**.
**Guards.** `MemberOf(–, Vehicle@ABSOnly, TargetSlice)` defined & deterministic; **Scope** (surface/speed/rig/Γ\_time) checked separately.
**Promotion?** If ABS‑only becomes a conceptual category, publish `VehicleWithABS ⊑ Vehicle` and retire the mask.

### 10.2 · `AuthenticatedRequest@Frontend` (vocabulary mask)

**Kind.** `AuthenticatedRequest` defined by `AuthContract v2.3`.
**Mask.** `@Frontend` binds `authHeader → X‑Auth` (aliases only); **no** narrowing; type **vocabulary**.
**Cross‑context.** If reused in another Context, require **KindBridge** for the kind; **no** MaskAdapter needed (aliases are local).
**R.** Only scope bridge penalties apply (if any).

### 10.3 · `AdultPatient@Clinic` (composite mask) across jurisdictions

**Kind.** `AdultPatient` (≥ 18 at `Γ_time`).
**Mask.** `@Clinic`: entity constraint “DOB present”; context hint “EHR system = X” (this part routes to Scope). Type **composite**.
**Cross‑context.** Jurisdiction Y uses ≥ 21 → **KindBridge** with `CL^k=1`; **MaskAdapter** maps DOB fields.
**Guards.** Scope bridge (coding system) + KindBridge + MaskAdapter; penalties **Ψ(1)** (kind) + **Φ(CL)** (scope) to **R**.
**Outcome.** Allowed with reduced R; consider target‑side subkind `AdultPerson_Y`.

## 11 · Authoring & Review Guidance (informative)

### 11.1 · Authoring a RoleMask card

**Fields (suggested).** `name`, `kind`, `type (constraint/vocabulary/composite)`, `intent`, `constraints (entity vs context split)`, `bindings`, `membership definition (if any)`, `definedness`, `examples`, `known bridges/adapters`, `promotion note`.
**Rules of thumb.**

* Keep entity predicates **small and testable**.
* Put **context** in Scope, not in membership.
* If ≥ 3 teams reuse the same constraint mask → **promotion** review.

### 11.2 · Reviewer 7‑point checklist

1. Mask **registered** and **versioned**?
2. **Type** declared correctly (constraint/vocabulary/composite)?
3. Entity vs context **split** respected?
4. **Determinism** (no “latest”) satisfied?
5. Guard **routes** context to **USM** and entity to **membership**?
6. Any Cross‑context use has **KindBridge** + **MaskAdapter** with penalties **to R**?
7. **Promotion** warranted (stable, reused) or consolidation needed?

# C.3.5 · **KindAT — Intentional Abstraction Facet for Kinds (K0…K3)**  \[I/A]

> **One‑line summary.** Defines **KindAT** as an **informative facet** attached to `U.Kind` that classifies the **intentional abstraction stance** of a kind—**K0 Instance**, **K1 Behavioral Pattern**, **K2 Formal Kind/Class**, **K3 Up‑to‑Iso**—to **guide ΔF/ΔR planning, bridge expectations, catalog/search, and refactoring**. **KindAT is not a Characteristic**: it has **no algebra**, **no thresholds**, and **MUST NOT** appear in guards or composition math. All assurance remains in **F–G–R**; typed semantics remain in **C.3.1–C.3.4**.

---

## 0 · Status, Placement, Dependencies 

**Status.** Mixed:
— **Informative** for the anchors, heuristics, examples, and guidance.
— **Normative** for the **usage rules** that forbid employing AT in guards/composition and constrain its placement.

**Placement.** Part C (Kinds), identifier **C.3.5**. Audience: engineering managers, architects, editors, assurance leads.

**Depends on.**
— **C.3.1** (`U.Kind`, `U.SubkindOf (⊑)`), **C.3.2** (`KindSignature` + F, `Extension/MemberOf`), **C.3.3** (KindBridge + `CL^k`), **C.3.4** (RoleMask).
— **A.2.6 USM** (Claim/Work scope over `U.ContextSlice`), **C.2.2 F–G–R**, **C.2.3 U.Formality (F)**.
— **MM‑CHR** distinction **Facet vs Characteristic** (editors).

**Non‑goals.**
— No numerical scale, no gating, no composition operators, no “quality” scoring.
— No effect on **F**, **G**, or **R** besides **planning hints**.

## 1 · Purpose (manager’s view)

Teams constantly decide **how far to formalize** and **how broadly to validate**:

* *Are we speaking about **this cohort** (instances), about **things that behave like X** (pattern), about a **formal class** with invariants, or about objects **up to isomorphism**?*
* *Given that stance, should we invest in **F4 predicates**, **F7 proofs**, or **R** across variants?*
* *What kind of **KindBridge** is realistic (coarse mapping vs up‑to‑iso), and what **`CL^k`** should we expect?*

**KindAT** answers these with a **small, shared vocabulary (K0…K3)** that is **safe to use** (cannot distort F/G/R) yet **actionable** for planning and catalog/search.

## 2 · Context & Rationale

### 2.1 · The orthogonality we preserve

* **G (Claim scope)** is **where** a claim holds (A.2.6).
* **Kinds** give **what** a claim is about (C.3.1/3.2).
* **R** is assurance (evidence, freshness, penalties).
* **F** is expression rigor (C.2.3).

Teams often **conflate abstraction with applicability** (“sounds general ⇒ applies broadly”) or **over‑engineer proofs** where **slice‑checks** suffice. AT separates these concerns.

### 2.2 · Why a facet, not a Characteristic

Per **MM‑CHR**, **Characteristics** (e.g., F, G) carry algebra and appear in guards/composition. **KindAT** is only a **tag** on `U.Kind`:

* **No algebra, no thresholds**, not used in guards.
* **Editorial placement** only: on kinds, not on claims.
* **Planning signal**: what ΔF and ΔR typically pay off; what bridge style to expect.

This keeps AT **useful** without risking a “second G” or back‑door quality scores.

### 2.3 · Design choice recap (moved from C.3 §15.2)

* Making AT a Characteristic would **duplicate** G’s role and encourage gating.
* As a **facet**, AT remains a **catalog/navigation and planning device**, not an assurance dimension.

## 3 · **Anchors K0…K3** (informative)

> **How to read.** Each anchor states the **intentional stance** of the kind, **inclusion cues**, **non‑examples** (to prevent misuse), and **planning hints** (ΔF/ΔR/bridge expectations). Anchors are **context‑local editorial tags** on `U.Kind`.

### 3.1 · **K0 — Instance‑level**

**Intent.** The kind denotes **exemplars** or a **tightly curated set**; often a named cohort or a concrete template.
**Cues.** Membership relies on listing or direct identity features; little to no general invariants.
**Non‑examples.** Any kind with stable, general invariants belongs in **K2**.
**Planning hints.** Focus **R on TargetSlice** (executable checks, F5/6); avoid premature proof engineering. Bridges are **instance‑maps**; expect **low `CL^k`** outside the Context.

### 3.2 · **K1 — Behavioral Pattern**

**Intent.** The kind is a **role/behavioral** pattern (“things that act like …”), typically stated via contracts or controlled NL, not a full type.
**Cues.** “Duck‑typing” flavor; contracts reference behavior/state transitions.
**Non‑examples.** If you can state global invariants as predicates, consider **K2**.
**Planning hints.** Invest in **F3→F4** (predicate‑like acceptances); **R** must test **behavioral diversity**; bridges are **pattern maps** with moderate `CL^k`.

### 3.3 · **K2 — Formal Kind/Class**

**Intent.** A **formal class** with explicit **invariants/relations** (ontology class, type with contracts).
**Cues.** Predicate‑like signature, subkind lattice, invariants reviewed.
**Non‑examples.** Pure examples/cohorts (K0); informal roles (K1).
**Planning hints.** Raise **KindSignature F** to **F4+**, consider **F7** for safety‑critical cores; **R** should cover **subkinds/variants**; bridges are **type‑maps**, `CL^k` often medium/high.

### 3.4 · **K3 — Up‑to‑Iso**

**Intent.** Defined **up to isomorphism/equivalence** (category‑theoretic flavor; “equal as structure,” not by identity); equality‑as‑structure matters.
**Cues.** Statements invariant under isomorphism; reasoning by equivalence classes.
**Non‑examples.** Classes where identity matters beyond structure.
**Planning hints.** Expect **up‑to‑iso** bridges; `CL^k` can be high where equivalence is respected. **F7–F9** likely for key properties; **R** focuses on **witnesses of equivalence** at interfaces.

## 4 · Manager Heuristics (informative)

| Decision area       | K0                               | K1                          | K2                                         | K3                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **ΔF investment**   | Prefer F5/6 executable semantics | F3→F4 acceptance predicates | F4→F7 (predicates/proofs)                  | F7→F9 (proof‑carrying, higher equality) |
| **ΔR design**       | Slice‑focused checks             | Behavioral diversity        | Variant/subkind coverage                   | Equivalence witnesses at boundaries     |
| **Bridge style**    | Instance map                     | Pattern map                 | Type map                                   | Up‑to‑iso / functorial                  |
| **Expected `CL^k`** | Low outside Context                 | Medium                      | Med/High                                   | High where iso holds                    |
| **Refactoring**     | Aggregate to K2 when stable      | Crystallize invariants → K2 | Maintain lattice; promote masks → subkinds | Keep iso constraints explicit           |

---

## 5 · Misuse & Antidotes (informative)

* **“Higher AT ⇒ wider G.”** *Wrong.* **G** changes only via **ΔG** (USM). AT does not alter scope.
* **“Gate on AT.”** *Wrong.* Use **F** thresholds and scope/evidence guards; AT is never a gate.
* **“Depth in `⊑` ⇒ AT.”** *Wrong.* AT is about **intentional stance**, not graph depth.
* **“AT on claims.”** *Wrong.* AT tags **`U.Kind` only**.
* **“AT as quality score.”** *Wrong.* Use **F** and **R** for rigor/reliability.

---

## 6 · **Usage Rules (normative)**

> These are the **only** normative constraints in this pattern. Everything else is guidance.

**AT‑01 (Facet, not Characteristic).** KindAT **SHALL** be treated as a **Facet** per MM‑CHR: it has **no algebra, no thresholds**, and **MUST NOT** appear in guards or composition math.

**AT‑02 (Placement).** If recorded, KindAT **SHALL** be attached to **`U.Kind`** (or its catalog card). It **MUST NOT** be attached to claims/capabilities or used as a proxy for **G**/**F**/**R**.

**AT‑03 (Editorial discipline).** Editors **SHALL NOT** write text implying “higher AT widens scope” or “higher AT increases rigor/reliability.” Any such text **MUST** be revised to reference **ΔG**/**F**/**R** explicitly.

**AT‑04 (Bridge neutrality).** **KindBridge** records **MUST NOT** compute or adjust AT; they may include *informative* remarks about likely anchor alignment. `CL^k` is independent of AT and is assessed from signature/order preservation.

**AT‑05 (Catalog).** Contexts that use AT **SHOULD** record it in **Kind catalog entries** alongside: signature snippet & **F**, subkinds, RoleMasks, KindBridges. Absence of AT implies **“not set”**, not K0.

---

## 7 · Authoring & Review Guidance (informative)

### 7.1 · How to tag (fast rubric)

* If the card lists **concrete items/cohorts**, tag **K0**.
* If the card defines **behavioral obligations** in prose/templates but few global invariants, tag **K1**.
* If the card states **predicates/invariants** and participates in a **subkind lattice**, tag **K2**.
* If the card explicitly reasons **up to isomorphism**, tag **K3**.

### 7.2 · Review checklist (5 minutes)

1. Is the **carrier** a **`U.Kind`** (not a claim)?
2. Does the **tag** match the **signature** (intent)?
3. Are **ΔF**/**ΔR** implications noted for planning (not gating)?
4. Any **RoleMasks** that should be promoted to subkinds (K2 hygiene)?
5. Any **Cross‑context reuse** that suggests **bridge style** (pattern/type/iso)?

---

## 8 · Integration Notes (informative)

* **With C.3.1/3.2 (Kinds, Signature, Extension).** AT guides *how* to evolve signature **F** and *what* R coverage is sensible; it **does not** change membership semantics.
* **With C.3.3 (KindBridge).** AT hints at likely **bridge style** (instance‑map / pattern‑map / type‑map / up‑to‑iso), but **`CL^k`** is still computed from signature/order preservation; penalties route to **R**.
* **With C.3.4 (RoleMask).** Persistent K1‑style masks often warrant **promotion to K2 subkinds**.
* **With A.2.6 (USM).** All scope decisions remain under **G**. AT text should never be used to infer coverage.
* **With C.2.3 (F).** AT does not raise/lower **F**; it **suggests** where raising F is cost‑effective.

---

## 9 · Worked Mini‑Examples (informative)

* **K0 (Instance).** `Account_US_GAAP_2025_Q1_Cohort`. Plan **R** slice checks; avoid type‑maps across Contexts.
* **K1 (Behavior).** `CacheableRequest` (“idempotent under retry; cache key well‑formed”). Raise **F3→F4**; design **R** for failure‑mode diversity; expect **pattern bridges**.
* **K2 (Formal).** `Account` with invariants (balance = debits−credits; posting rules). Raise **F4+**; plan **R** over `Asset`/`Liability` subkinds; bridge via **type maps**.
* **K3 (Up‑to‑Iso).** `UndirectedGraph` up to node relabeling. Expect **up‑to‑iso bridges**; proofs at **F7+**; **R** checks interface equivalence witnesses.

# C.3.A · **Typed Guard Macros for Kinds + USM (Annex)**  \[A/I]

> **One‑line summary.** Provides **normative guard macros** that combine **USM Scope** (A.2.6) with **Kind‑CAL** (C.3.x) so authors can gate state changes and compositions that **quantify over kinds** without conflating **aboutness** (Kinds) with **applicability** (Scope **G**) or **assurance** (**R**). Includes **decision trees, anti‑patterns, and examples** (informative). **AT (KindAT)** is **never** used in guards.

---

## 0 · Status, Placement, Dependencies 

**Status.** Mixed:
— **Normative**: guard macro clauses, evaluation order, fail‑closed discipline, conformance checklist.
— **Informative**: ... decision trees, anti‑patterns, worked examples, macro skeletons.

**Placement.** Part C (Kinds), identifier **C.3.A** (Annex). Audience: engineering managers, editors, reviewers, assurance leads.

**Depends on.**
— **A.2.6 USM**: `U.ContextSlice`, `U.ClaimScope` (**G**), `U.WorkScope`, ∈/∩/**SpanUnion**/translate, **Γ\_time** policy, Bridge + **CL** (scope).
— **C.3.1**: `U.Kind`, `U.SubkindOf (⊑)`; **C.3.2**: `KindSignature` (with **F**) and `Extension/MemberOf`; **C.3.3**: **KindBridge** + `CL^k` (kind‑congruence) & loss notes; **C.3.4**: **RoleMask**.
— **C.3.5**: **KindAT** (facet) — **explicitly forbidden** in guards.
— **C.2.2 F–G–R**: weakest‑link, penalties to **R** only; **C.2.3 F**: F0…F9 (expression rigor).
— **Part B Bridges & CL**: scope bridge semantics and CL ladder.

## 1 · Purpose & Audience

**Purpose.** Give Contexts a **single set** of guard shapes to:
(a) **admit** typed claims safely,
(b) **compose** typed claims/specs,
(c) **use** RoleMasks properly, and
(d) **reuse across Contexts** via **both** scope and kind bridges—**without** inventing new scales or conflating **G**, **F**, and **R**.

**Audience.** Engineering managers and reviewers who must read/author guards that are **legible, deterministic, and auditable** in context.

---

## 2 · Context & Problem

Projects often:

* treat **“more abstract wording”** as wider **G**,
* glue claims with incompatible **aboutness** (kinds),
* move typed content across Contexts without **declared bridges**,
* or bake **AT** (abstraction vibe) into decision logic.

**C.3.A** fixes this by supplying guard macros that:
— **separate** typed compatibility (kinds) from **Scope** coverage (USM),
— require **both** bridges where needed,
— push congruence penalties to **R** only, and
— forbid **AT** in guards.

---

## 3 · Solution Overview (what these guards do)

All guards in this Annex share three invariants:

1. **Fail‑closed.** If any required predicate is undefined/false, the guard **denies** the transition.
2. **Deterministic.** Given a fixed **TargetSlice** (with explicit **Γ\_time**) and published declarations, evaluation yields one outcome.
3. **Separation of concerns.**
   *Typed compatibility* (same‑Context `⊑` or **KindBridge**) is **not** Scope.
   *Scope coverage* is a USM set‑membership judgment over **Context slices**.
   *Assurance penalties* (**Φ(CL)** for scope bridges; **Ψ(`CL^k`)** for kind bridges) reduce **R** only.

---

## 4 · Normative Guard Macros

> **Notation.** “**SHALL**” clauses are normative obligations. “Notes” are informative reminders. Names like `Guard_TypedClaim` are editorial handles; Contexts may alias them, but **MUST** preserve semantics. Macro names (e.g., `Guard_TypedClaim`) are editorial handles; Contexts may alias them provided the logical obligations are preserved.


### 4.1 · **Guard\_TypedClaim** — admit a claim quantified over a kind

**Intent.** Approve a state transition that asserts Claim **C** which quantifies over `U.Kind` **k** at **TargetSlice**.

**Guard\_TypedClaim(C, k, TargetSlice, thresholds?)** — **SHALL** include, in this order:

1. **ScopeCoverage.** `U.ClaimScope(C) covers TargetSlice`. *(USM A.2.6)*
2. **Γ\_time declared.** TargetSlice **SHALL** specify **Γ\_time** (point/window/policy). No “latest”. *(A.2.6)*
3. **Kind definedness.** `MemberOf(?, k, TargetSlice)` is **defined and deterministic**. *(C.3.2 K‑05/K‑07)*
4. **Typed compatibility.**
   4.1 **same Context**: if C expects `k′`, require `k ⊑ k′`. *(C.3.1)*
   4.2 **Cross Context**: if Contexts differ, require a declared **KindBridge** that maps `k → k′` and publishes **`CL^k ≥ c`** with loss notes. *(C.3.3)*
5. **Assurance penalties (R only).** If step 4.2 used a KindBridge, the guard **SHALL** apply a monotone penalty **Ψ(`CL^k`)** to **R**. If a **Scope bridge** was used to move C’s Scope (USM), apply **Φ(CL)** to **R**. *(C.2.2 + C.3.3 + Part B)*
6. **Evidence freshness (if trust is implied).** Freshness windows and expiry checks **SHALL** be separate predicates (not Scope). *(C.2.2)*
7. **Formality threshold (if ESG mandates).** If the Context gates rigor, require `U.Formality(C) ≥ F_k`. *(C.2.3)*

**Prohibitions.**
— **AT forbidden.** KindAT **MUST NOT** appear in this guard. *(C.3.5 AT‑01/02)*
— **No “domain” placeholders.** Guards **SHALL** name an addressable **TargetSlice**, not a fuzzy “domain”.

---

### 4.2 · **Guard\_TypedJoin** — compose two typed claims/specs (A → B)

**Intent.** Permit composition where **A** produces facts over `k_A` and **B** consumes `k_B`.

**Guard\_TypedJoin(A, k\_A; B, k\_B; TargetSlice)** — **SHALL** include:

1. **TypedCompat.**
   1.1 **same Context**: require `k_A ⊑ k_B`.
   1.2 **Cross Context**: require **KindBridge** mapping `k_A → k′_B` with **`CL^k ≥ c`** and `k′_B ⊑ k_B`.
2. **ScopeSerial.** Compute `Scope_serial = ClaimScope(A) ∩ ClaimScope(B)`. Require `Scope_serial covers TargetSlice`. *(A.2.6)*
3. **Penalties (R only).** Apply **Ψ(`CL^k`)** if a KindBridge was used; apply **Φ(CL)** if a Scope bridge was used. *(C.2.2 / Part B / C.3.3)*
4. **Freshness.** Guard **SHALL** assert required freshness windows for evidence **along the serial path**.
5. **No type‑by‑scope.** The guard **MUST NOT** widen Scope to “fix” a type mismatch; remedies are subkind introduction, adapter, or bridge.

**Mask awareness.** If B expects a **RoleMask(k\_B)**: either show A’s outputs already satisfy mask constraints, or add a documented **mask adapter** (see 4.3) and treat any **contextual** constraints as part of **ScopeSerial**.

---

### 4.3 · **Guard\_MaskedUse** — use a RoleMask with a kind

**Intent.** Use `U.Kind` **k** under a **RoleMask** **m** in Context **R**.

**Guard\_MaskedUse(k, m, TargetSlice)** — **SHALL** include:

1. **MaskRegistered.** `RoleMask(k, m, version)` is **registered and versioned**. *(C.3.4 RM‑06)*
2. **MaskDeterminism.** All mask constraints are **observable** on TargetSlice; if the mask narrows membership, it **SHALL** be deterministic. *(RM‑03)*
3. **MaskType clarity.** Mask **SHALL** declare its type: constraint / vocabulary / composite. *(RM‑04)*
4. **Promotion cue.** If mask is reused widely as a de‑facto subkind, editors **SHOULD** promote it to an explicit `⊑` link. *(RM‑05)*
5. **Cross‑context use.** If `TargetSlice.Context ≠ owner(k).Context`, require:
   5.1 **KindBridge** with **`CL^k ≥ c`**;
   5.2 **MaskAdapter** (if constraints need translation), deterministic;
   5.3 Penalty **Ψ(`CL^k`)** to **R**. *(RM‑07 + C.3.3)*
6. **ScopeCoverage.** `U.ClaimScope(artifact) covers TargetSlice`. *(A.2.6)*

**Prohibitions.**
— **Mask ≠ Kind.** Guards **MUST NOT** treat the mask name as a synonym for the Kind. *(RM‑06)*

### 4.4 · **Guard\_SpanUnion\_Typed** — publish parallel coverage across independent support lines

**Intent.** Publish **SpanUnion** of scopes for **the same typed claim** supported by **independent** lines `L₁…Lₙ`.

**Guard\_SpanUnion\_Typed(C, k, {Lᵢ})** — **SHALL** include:

1. **Per‑line discipline.** For each line `Lᵢ`, first satisfy **Guard\_TypedClaim(C, k, Sliceᵢ)** (or its Cross‑context variant) at the relevant slices/supports.
2. **Independence justification.** Publisher **SHALL** include a partition or certificate showing that essential components of `Lᵢ` are **disjoint** from `Lⱼ` (no shared weakest link). *(A.2.6 §7.3)*
3. **Published scope.** `Scope_published = SpanUnion({Sᵢ})`, where each `Sᵢ` is the serial scope for line `Lᵢ`.
4. **No overreach.** The union **MUST NOT** include slices not covered by any `Sᵢ`.
5. **Typed consistency.** The **aboutness** (kind **k**) is **the same** across lines; if not, normalize via subkinds or adapters before union.

**Note.** Independence and union rules are USM‑native; this macro ties them to typed claims without adding new algebra.

---

### 4.5 · **Guard\_XContext\_Typed** — Cross‑context typed reuse (both bridges)

**Intent.** Reuse **C** quantified over **k** in another Context’s **TargetSlice**.

**Guard\_XContext\_Typed(C, k, TargetSlice)** — **SHALL** include:

1. **Scope bridge.** There **exists** a Scope Bridge **b\_s** `(source = owner(C).Context, target = TargetSlice.Context)` with **CL ≥ c\_s**. *(Part B)*
2. **Kind bridge.** There **exists** a KindBridge **b\_k** `(source = owner(k).Context, target = TargetSlice.Context)` with **`CL^k ≥ c_k`**. *(C.3.3)*
3. **Mapped scope coverage.** `Scope′ = translate(b_s, ClaimScope(C))` and `Scope′ covers TargetSlice`.
4. **Mapped kind definedness.** `k′ = translate(b_k, k)` and `MemberOf(?, k′, TargetSlice)` is **defined**.
5. **Penalties (R only).** Apply **Φ(CL(b\_s))** and **Ψ(`CL^k(b_k)`)** to **R**.
6. **Loss notes.** Publisher **SHALL** attach loss notes from both bridges (rig bias, collapsed subkinds, etc.).

**Prohibitions.**
— **Do not** “merge” bridges; Scope and Kind are orthogonal channels.
— **Do not** alter **F** or **G** due to `CL`/`CL^k`; penalties land in **R** only.

---

## 5 · Evaluation Semantics & Order (normative)

**E‑01 (Order of checks).** Guards **SHALL** check **typed compatibility first** (same‑Context `⊑` or KindBridge), **then** Scope coverage (USM), **then** apply penalties to **R** and verify freshness.

**E‑02 (Determinism).** Given fixed inputs (slices, bridges, versions), evaluation **MUST** be deterministic. “Latest” time, unversioned contracts, or implicit mappings are disallowed.

**E‑03 (Fail‑closed).** Undefined membership (`MemberOf`) or missing bridge **MUST** cause guard failure.

**E‑04 (No AT in guards).** AT is an editorial facet and **MUST NOT** be referenced. *(C.3.5 AT‑01/02)*

**E‑05 (Weakest link on congruence).** For chained bridges, effective **CL** / **`CL^k`** is the **minimum** of links.

**E‑06 (Separation of predicates).** Scope coverage and evidence freshness **SHALL** be distinct predicates; do not fold freshness into Scope or kinds.

**Evaluation order.** Apply checks in the order defined in **§5 (E‑01)**: typed compatibility → Scope coverage → penalties to **R** → freshness.

| **GC‑01** | Guards that admit/compose typed claims **SHALL** use **Guard\_TypedClaim** or **Guard\_TypedJoin** (or proven‑equivalent Context aliases).  |
| **GC‑02** | Guards that use RoleMasks **SHALL** use **Guard\_MaskedUse** (or equivalent) and comply with RM‑01…RM‑07.                                |
| **GC‑03** | Cross‑context typed reuse **SHALL** use **Guard\_XContext\_Typed** with **both** bridges; penalties **MUST** route to **R** (Φ/Ψ), not to F/G. |
| **GC‑04** | All guards **SHALL** declare **Γ\_time** explicitly and **SHALL** fail closed on undefined membership or missing bridges.                |
| **GC‑05** | Guards **MUST NOT** reference **AT**; any such reference **MUST** be removed or replaced with ΔF/ΔG/ΔR predicates.                       |
| **GC‑06** | Scope union **MUST** follow USM **SpanUnion** rules (independence justification); typed union **MUST NOT** change aboutness.             |

### 6.1 · What counts as “proven‑equivalent” (editorial rule)

A Context may adopt a different surface phrasing **iff** the Context’s guard contains **all** obligations listed in the relevant macro, in the same logical roles (typed compatibility, Scope coverage, R penalties, freshness).

### 6.2 · Where penalties land (assurance calculus hook)

**Norm.** **Φ(CL)** (scope congruence) and **Ψ(`CL^k`)** (kind congruence) are **monotone non‑increasing** functions into **R**. Contexts **SHALL** calibrate them per policy; this Annex does not prescribe numeric forms.

### 6.3 · Minimal conceptual formulas (informative)

* **R after bridges:** `R_final = R_base × Φ(CL_scope) × Ψ(CL_kind)` (concept only).
* **No arithmetic on F/G.** F is ordinal (thresholds only); G is set‑valued (membership only).

---

## 7 · Decision Trees (informative)

**D1 · Admitting a typed claim**

1. **same Context?** If **yes** → check `⊑` (`k ⊑ k′` if expected). If **no** → require **KindBridge**.
2. **Scope coverage?** Compute `covers(TargetSlice)`.
3. **Membership defined?** `MemberOf(?, k(′), TargetSlice)` defined? If **no** → deny.
4. **Bridges used?** Apply penalties **Φ/Ψ** to **R**.
5. **Freshness?** Check windows. **Optional**: `F ≥ F_k` if ESG mandates.

**D2 · Composing A → B**

1. Typed: `k_A ⊑ k_B` or **KindBridge** to `k′_B ⊑ k_B`.
2. Scope: `Scope(A) ∩ Scope(B)` covers TargetSlice.
3. Penalties: apply **Φ/Ψ** to **R**.
4. Freshness: along serial path.
5. If **mask** expected: either A implies it or add **mask adapter**.

**D3 · Union across lines**

1. Prove per‑line typed admission.
2. Provide independence partition.
3. Publish **SpanUnion**; no extrapolation.

## 8 · Guard Anti‑patterns & Remedies (informative)

| Anti‑pattern                                     | Why it’s wrong                         | Remedy                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Widening G** to “fit” a type mismatch          | Conflates aboutness with applicability | Introduce subkind, adapter, or KindBridge; keep G honest           |
| **Using mask name as kind**                      | Hides constraints; breaks determinism  | Register mask; reference constraints; promote to subkind if stable |
| **Ignoring `CL^k`** in Cross‑context classification | Under‑counts risk; silent drift        | Require KindBridge; apply **Ψ(`CL^k`)** to **R**                   |
| **Inferring Scope from Extension size**          | Scope ≠ Extension                      | Keep Scope (where) distinct from Extension (which instances)       |
| **Implicit “latest”** time                       | Non‑deterministic; non‑auditable       | Declare **Γ\_time** policy explicitly                              |

## 9 · Worked Examples (informative, brief)

> Detailed scenarios remain in **C.3 §11**. This Annex sketches how the macros apply; cross‑reference as needed.

**E1 — Safety braking policy (same Context).**
Use **Guard\_TypedClaim**: `PassengerCar ⊑ Vehicle` passes; `ClaimScope` ∩ plant scopes covers TargetSlice; no bridges → no penalties; freshness checked.

**E2 — Cross‑plant reuse (both bridges).**
Use **Guard\_XContext\_Typed**: Scope bridge (CL=2) narrows temp; KindBridge (`CL^k=2`) collapses EV subkind. Apply **Φ(2)**×**Ψ(2)** to **R**; publish loss notes.

**E3 — API rule with adapter.**
Use **Guard\_TypedJoin**: producer `Request` → consumer expects `AuthenticatedRequest`. Either prove `⊑` or add adapter; Scope remains separate (API v2.3 with Γ\_time window).

**E4 — Masked clinic cohort across jurisdiction.**
Use **Guard\_MaskedUse** + **Guard\_XContext\_Typed**: registered mask, deterministic DOB constraint; KindBridge `CL^k=1`; Scope bridge CL depends on coding; penalties to **R**; Scope narrowed to overlap.

## 10 · Rationale (why an Annex) (informative)

* **Focus.** Keeps **guard mechanics** together, easing adoption in ESG/Method templates.
* **Separation.** Prevents leakage of AT/typed flavor into “Scope math”.
* **Auditability.** Standard shapes let reviewers check determinism, bridges, penalties, and freshness quickly.
* **Inter‑pattern glue.** Hooks **USM**, **Kind‑CAL**, **Bridges**, and **F–G–R** without inventing new scales.

### Annex A · How typed reasoning plugs into **Compliance & Regulatory Alignment**  \[A/I]

> **For managers.** This section shows how to make **regulatory adoption and reuse** precise, auditable, and portable using **Kinds**, **KindBridges** (with a kind‑bridge congruence level, noted as **CL^k** for editors), and **USM Scope**. It cleanly separates *what the law is about* from *where and when it applies*, and routes any cross‑jurisdiction uncertainty to **R** (assurance). It never changes **F** (form) or **G** (scope) to hide mismatches.

---

#### A.1 Purpose & fit

**What this solves.** Regulations and standards name classes of things (“**Adult person**,” “**Class II medical device**,” “**Personal data**,” “**Lease**”). In one context they are native; in another they are foreign. Without typed reasoning, teams either (a) hand‑translate terms (silently changing meaning), or (b) reduce everything to Context labels (“domain = EU”), which cannot be checked by guards.

**What we add.**

1. Model regulatory categories as **Kinds** (with `KindSignature` and `⊑`),
2. map them across Contexts with **KindBridges** and **type‑congruence `CL^k`**,
3. express **Claim scope (G)** over **Context slices** that explicitly list *jurisdiction, version, and a time selector (Γ_time)*, and
4. apply **R‑penalties** (`Ψ(CL^k)`and, if scope is bridged,`Φ(CL)`) while **keeping F and G unchanged**.

---

#### A.2 Normative obligations  \[A]

**C‑REG‑1 (Regulatory kinds).** Regulatory categories **SHALL** be represented as `U.Kind` in the authority’s Context (e.g., `AdultPerson@RegY`, `MedicalDeviceClassII@FDA`, `PersonalData@GDPR`, `Lease@IFRS`). Each such kind **SHALL** have a `KindSignature` with a declared **F** level (C.3.2).

**C‑REG‑2 (KindBridge).** Cross‑context reuse of a regulatory category **MUST** declare a **KindBridge** with a kind‑bridge congruence level (**CL^k**) and **loss notes** (C.3.3). The mapping **SHALL** preserve the “is‑a / subkind‑of” direction (no inversions).

**C‑REG‑3 (Scope is USM).** Regulatory **applicability** (jurisdiction, effective dates, product families, platforms) **SHALL** be expressed as **Claim scope (G)** over `U.ContextSlice`, with an explicit **time selector (Γ_time)**. Do **not** encode applicability into kinds.

**C‑REG‑4 (No synonym shortcuts).** Editors **MUST NOT** treat legal terms as synonyms of local kinds without a KindBridge. Any term alignment **SHALL** be documented (mapping + `CL^k` + loss notes).

**C‑REG‑5 (Determinism).** `MemberOf(e, k_reg, slice)` **MUST** be deterministically evaluable when used in guards (no “latest law” or unstated grace periods).

**C‑REG‑6 (Penalties land in R).** When a claim or guard relies on Cross‑context classification (membership decided via a KindBridge), the receiving Context **MUST** apply the **kind‑bridge penalty** (based on **CL^k**) to **R**; if the **Scope** is also bridged, apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** (based on **CL**) to **R** as well. **F** and **G** remain unchanged.

**C‑REG‑7 (Editioning).** Changes in law/regulator guidance that alter membership or applicability **SHALL** be recorded as content changes: update `KindSignature` (kinds) and/or update **Claim scope** (ΔG±). Using an implicit “latest” time is forbidden; guards must name a time selector (Γ_time).

**C‑REG‑8 (Masks, not clones).** Local process nuances (e.g., clinic‑specific cohort definitions) **SHALL** be captured with **RoleMasks** over the adopted kind; do **not** clone a new kind unless a stable **subkind** is warranted.

---

#### A.3 Guard macros (ready to use)  \[A]

**(a) `Guard_RegAdopt` — adopt a regulatory requirement into a Context (Plain: check scope, map the legal category, and account for penalties)**

Use when an internal policy is defined by reference to an authority’s category.

```
Inputs: Claim P (policy), RegKind k_reg in Context R_auth, TargetSlice S_local
Guard_RegAdopt(P, k_reg, S_local):
  1. ScopeCoverage:       U.ClaimScope(P) covers S_local                 // USM
  2. Γ_time:              S_local specifies Γ_time (no "latest")         // USM
  3. KindBridge:          a KindBridge exists that maps the legal category to a local kind, with **CL^k** at least the minimum policy level
  4. MemberOfDefined:     MemberOf(?, k_local, S_local) is defined       // determinism
  5. Penalties→R:         apply the **kind‑bridge penalty** (based on CL^k) to **R**
  6. ScopeBridge?         if the policy’s scope lives in the authority’s Context, translate it via a Scope Bridge; apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** (based on CL) to **R**
  7. EvidenceFreshness:   freshness windows for any bound evidence hold  // C.2.2
```

**(b) `Guard_RegChange` — react to a regulatory change (Plain: re‑issue the kind and/or scope and refresh penalties)**

```
Inputs: Reg change Δ (new edition, guidance), impacted kinds/claims
Guard_RegChange(Δ):
  1. Identify impact:      does Δ alter KindSignature (membership) or Scope predicates?
  2. If KindSignature:     version k_reg; update KindBridge; re-evaluate CL^k; update loss notes
  3. If Scope:             publish ΔG± (widen/narrow) to Claim scope; update guards
  4. Reassess penalties:   recompute Ψ(CL^k), Φ(CL) → R
  5. Γ_time discipline:    set sunrise/sunset; forbid implicit retroactivity in guards
```

**(c) `Guard_RegXContextUse` — cross‑jurisdiction use with both bridges (Plain: move scope and kind, then account for both penalties)**

```
Guard_RegXContextUse(P, k_reg@R_auth, S_local@R_local):
  1. Scope bridge:      a Scope Bridge from the authority Context to the local context exists with CL at least the policy minimum; the translated scope covers the local slice
  2. Kind bridge:       a KindBridge maps the legal category to a local kind with **CL^k** at least the policy minimum
  3. MemberOfDefined:   MemberOf(?, k_local, S_local) is defined
  4. Penalties→R:       apply the **scope‑bridge** and **kind‑bridge** penalties to **R**
  5. Loss-guided narrow: optionally narrow Scope' where known losses are material (best practice)
```

---

#### A.4 Worked examples  \[I]

**(1) Healthcare — “Adult” dosage rule across jurisdictions**

*Reg source.* Jurisdiction Y defines `AdultPerson@RegY` (AT around K2, F4) with **age at least 18**; your hospital Context uses `AdultPatient` (**age at least 21**).
*Claim.* “For all `x ∈ AdultPatient`: dosage ≤ D/kg for drug M.”
*Adoption.*

* **KindBridge.** Map `AdultPerson@RegY → AdultPatient`; **`CL^k = 1`**; **loss note:** boundary mismatch (18↔21).
* **Scope.** `{jurisdiction=Y, formulary=M, time selector (Γ_time)=from 2026‑01‑01}`.
* **Guard.** `Guard_RegAdopt` passes; **R** penalized by `Ψ(1)`. Policy narrows Scope to mapped cohort (age≥21) for in‑house use.
* **Change.** If Y changes adult to ≥19 (new edition), run `Guard_RegChange`: version the kind, refresh the bridge, re‑assess `CL^k`, update guards.

**(2) Privacy — GDPR↔CCPA PII across Contexts**

*Reg kinds.* `PersonalData@GDPR`, `PersonalInformation@CCPA`.
*Internal kind.* `PersonalData@Product` with masks per data store.
*Policy claim.* “No sharing of `SensitiveAttribute` outside processors.”
*Adoption.*

* **KindBridges.** `SensitiveAttribute@GDPR → SensitiveAttribute@Product` (**`CL^k=2`**); `SensitivePersonalInformation@CCPA → SensitiveAttribute@Product` (**`CL^k=1`**, loss: biometric nuance).
* **Scope.** Two policies with **SpanUnion** over `{jurisdiction=EU}` and `{jurisdiction=CA}`, each with its own **Γ\_time** windows and evidence freshness.
* **Guards.** For CA, apply stronger **R** penalty (`Ψ(1)`), and narrow to the mapped subset (exclude ambiguous fields).
* **Do not.** Do not rename GDPR terms to local labels **without a KindBridge**.

**(3) Export control — US EAR “600‑series” classification**

*Reg kind.* `EAR600SeriesItem@US` (AT≈K2, F3→F4 as predicates are formalized).
*Local kind.* `Product@Company`.
*Work scope.* `{destination=countries, end_use, time selector (Γ_time)=shipment date}` for the shipping capability.
*Adoption.*

* **KindBridge.** Map `EAR600SeriesItem@US → Product@Company`; `CL^k=2` (loss: component kit edge cases); loss notes recorded.
* **Capability guard (Method–Work).**

  * `U.WorkScope(Ship)` covers `JobSlice` (destination, end use, time).
  * `MemberOf(product, EAR600_mapped, JobSlice)` defined (classification present).
  * Apply `Ψ(2)` to **R** (classification uncertainty) and, if reusing US scope text, `Φ(CL_scope)` too.
* **Outcome.** Shipment admitted only for allowed destinations; higher **R** may require manual review.

**(4) Finance — IFRS vs US GAAP “Lease”**

*Reg kinds.* `Lease@IFRS`, `Lease@USGAAP`.
*Local kind.* `LeaseContract@Corp` used in policy “recognize lease liabilities.”
*Adoption.*
* **KindBridge.** `Lease@IFRS → LeaseContract@Corp` (**`CL^k=2`**; loss: short‑term exceptions differ).
* **Scope.** `{jurisdiction=IFRS, Γ_time=financial period, ledger=v7}`.
* **Evidence.** LA plans cover subkinds (operating vs finance) per your classification; the kind‑bridge congruence level (CL^k) drives extra testing near boundary cases.

---

#### A.5 Design guidance & pitfalls  \[I]

**Do this.**

* **Treat regulatory categories as Kinds.** Put the *definition* into `KindSignature` (aim for **F4** predicates where practical).
* **Make time explicit.** In guards, require a **time selector (Γ_time)** for effective dates and grace periods. Forbid “latest”.
* **Publish bridges with loss notes.** If two jurisdictions’ categories are “almost the same,” say *how*, rate **`CL^k`**, and note what is lost.
* **Split “where” from “what.”** Keep **Scope (G)** over `U.ContextSlice` (jurisdiction, plant, contract versions) separate from **MemberOf** on the kind.
* **Route uncertainty to R.** Use `Ψ(CL^k)` and `Φ(CL)`; never modify **F/G** to hide ambiguity.

**Avoid this.**

* **Synonym games.** Don’t alias “Adult” to local `AdultPatient` in prose. Use a **KindBridge**.
* **Scope by labels.** “Domain = EU” is not a guard. Use explicit `U.ContextSlice` fields (jurisdiction, version, time selector) and **Scope** predicates.
* **Hiding time.** Never rely on “current law”; always fix **Γ\_time** (point/window/policy).
* **Widening G to compensate for type gaps.** If kinds don’t line up, introduce a **subkind**, add a **mask/adapter**, or **narrow**; don’t “make the scope bigger”.

---

#### A.6 Migration checklist  \[I]

1. **Inventory** regulatory references in policies/specs.
2. **Create Kind cards** for referenced legal categories (intent summary, `KindSignature` + **F**, known subkinds, AT tag if helpful).
3. **Publish KindBridges** to your local kinds with `CL^k` and loss notes.
4. **Rewrite guards** to use **Scope coverage** (USM) plus `MemberOf` on the mapped kind; add an explicit **time selector (Γ_time)**.
5. **Wire penalties**: `Ψ(CL^k)` and `Φ(CL)` lower **R**; refresh evidence windows.
6. **Catalog RoleMasks** for local nuances; promote frequently reused masks to **subkinds**.

---

#### A.7 Manager’s one‑page pattern  \[I]

* **Question 1 — Where does the rule apply?** → **Scope (G)** over **Context slices** (jurisdiction, plant, contract, and a **time selector (Γ_time)**).
* **Question 2 — About what things?** → **Kind** (regulatory category) with a **KindBridge** if foreign.
* **Gate recipe.** **Scope covers the TargetSlice** and **membership for the mapped kind is defined**, and **both bridges are present where needed**; then **apply bridge penalties to R** and decide.
* **Change handling.** New law edition? Update `KindSignature`/Bridge (kinds) and/or **Scope** (ΔG); never rely on “latest.”
* **Accountability.** Keep **loss notes**, **CL/CL^k**, and **Γ\_time** in the decision record.


### Annex B · How typed reasoning plugs into **Assurance Lanes (VA/LA/TA) & Evidence design**  \[A/I]

**Intent (manager’s view).** Typed reasoning turns “prove/test/qualify” into a **repeatable plan**. By making *what the rule talks about* explicit (named **Kinds**, their **subkinds**, and optional **RoleMasks**), you can:

1. design **proof obligations** that actually quantify over the right things (VA),
2. build **test plans** that cover the **right variants/subkinds** in the **right context slices** (LA), and
3. isolate **tool risk** (TA) instead of letting it bleed into scope or type semantics.

**Invariant reminders.**
— **Scope (G)** is *where* a claim holds — expressed over `U.ContextSlice` (with an explicit time selector, **Γ_time**).
— **Kind membership** is *which things* the claim ranges over inside that slice — checked with `MemberOf(..., kind, slice)`.
— **Bridge penalties**: the **scope‑bridge penalty** (based on **CL**) and the **kind‑bridge penalty** (based on **CL^k**) both lower **R** (assurance). They never change **F** (form) or **G** (scope).

#### B.1 What you get with typed assurance  \[I]

* **Targeted proofs (VA).** If a policy says “for every **PassengerCar** …” (notation hint: ∀x:PassengerCar), the VA lane now has a clear target. You can prove obligations **once for the kind** (and its subkinds), instead of re‑proving per ad‑hoc label.
* **Subkind‑aware test plans (LA).** Test matrices are indexed by **subkinds** (and RoleMasks) × **context slices**; coverage stops being accidental.
* **Deterministic guards.** A test/proof either **applies** to the TargetSlice and Kind (`Scope covers & MemberOf defined`) or it doesn’t. No “latest,” no silent widening.
* **Clean tool boundaries (TA).** You qualify the **prover/model‑checker/classifier** once and route **tool confidence** to TA, not to “broadened” claims.

---

#### B.2 Normative obligations for evidence design  \[A]

**EA‑1 (Two checks).** Every VA/LA artifact that supports a typed claim **SHALL** bind **both**:

* **Scope predicate**: `U.ClaimScope(Claim) covers TargetSlice` (with explicit `Γ_time`), and
* **Kind predicate**: `MemberOf(?, k, TargetSlice)` is **defined** (deterministic).

**EA‑2 (Subkind coverage).** When a claim quantifies over `k`, target‑contexts **SHALL** justify LA coverage **per relevant subkind** of `k` (or **per RoleMask** if masks stand in for stable subkinds). “Representative set” **MUST** be stated explicitly.

**EA‑3 (Independence for unions).** If a published **SpanUnion** of evidence lines is used to enlarge covered area, **independence** of lines **SHALL** be documented (no shared weakest link).

**EA‑4 (Bridges accounted).** If a VA/LA artifact travels across Contexts:

* **Scope movement** **SHALL** use a Scope Bridge (Part B) with **CL** and apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** to **R**.
* **Kind movement** **SHALL** use a **KindBridge** (§ C.3.3) with **CL^k** and apply the **kind‑bridge penalty** to **R**.
  Neither movement **SHALL** alter **F** or **G**.

  Neither movement **SHALL** alter **F** nor **G**.

**EA‑5 (Freshness).** LA evidence **SHALL** declare freshness windows tied to `Γ_time` (no implicit “latest”). Expiry **MUST** fail guards closed until refreshed.

**EA‑6 (No scope‑by‑wording).** Editors **MUST NOT** widen **G** by rewriting a claim to sound “more general.” Widening **G** (ΔG+) is permitted **only** with new support that truly enlarges the set of slices.

**EA‑7 (TA separation).** Tool qualification (TA) **SHALL** be tracked independently. VA/LA guards **MUST NOT** substitute “tool is trusted” for content proof/coverage.

---

#### B.3 Designing the **evidence matrix**  \[I]

A practical way to plan LA/VA is a **matrix**:

| Row set                       | Column set                                                   | Cell content                                                                                                           |

| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kinds** (subkinds or masks) | **Context slices** (contract versions, env ranges, `Γ_time`) | **Evidence unit** (proof fragment, test batch, monitoring window), with **Scope** and **MemberOf** predicates attached |

* **Choose rows.** Start with the kind and list **relevant subkinds** (notation hint: kᵢ is a subkind of k) or stable **RoleMasks**.
* **Choose columns.** Split your declared **Scope (G)** into **named slices** you intend to support (e.g., “dry, speed up to 50” and “wet, speed up to 40” with specific rigs and versioned contracts).
* **Fill cells.** Attach one or more **evidence units** per cell (proof obligations for VA; test campaigns/monitoring windows for LA). Mark **bridged** cells and their **CL/CL^k** penalties to **R**.

> **Tip.** For formal kinds and “up‑to‑iso” kinds (AT K2/K3), expect **more rows** (more variants to cover). For instance‑like kinds (AT K0), expect **fewer rows** and **tighter columns** (narrow slices, stricter freshness).

---

#### B.4 VA lane — proofs that match the kind  \[A/I]

**What VA contributes.** Proofs reduce ambiguity and eliminate many LA burdens when they **truly quantify over the intended kind** and **live in the declared Scope**.

**VA‑patterns (informative):**

* **Proof over the Kind (F7–F8).** “For every **PassengerCar**, the property holds” (notation hint: ∀x:PassengerCar). If the property depends on subkind‑specific rules, split lemmas per subkind.
* **Proof‑carrying components.** When the content is **F8** (dependent types), the build rejects violations; LA can shrink to **conformance smoke** within the slices.
* **Up‑to‑iso (AT K3).** Equational reasoning “up‑to‑iso” is acceptable **only** if the KindSignature works at that level and receivers accept **KindBridge** that preserves equivalences.

**VA‑obligations (normative):**

* **VA‑1.** A proof artifact **SHALL** cite the **Kind** it quantifies over and reference the **Claim scope** slices it assumes.
* **VA‑2.** Cross‑context acceptance of proofs **SHALL** use both bridges (Scope+Kind) and apply **Φ/Ψ** penalties to **R** (never to F/G).
* **VA‑3.** If the proof relies on **tool kernels**, their **TA** status **SHALL** be disclosed; weakening TA **MUST NOT** be “paid for” by silent scope widening.

**Mini‑example (VA).**
Policy P: “∀ x: PassengerCar. stoppingDistance(x) ≤ 50 m on dry at speed≤50.”
— **Kind**: `PassengerCar ⊑ Vehicle` (K2), signature F4 (predicates).
— **Scope**: `{surface=dry, speed≤50, rig=v3, Γ_time=rolling 180 d}`.
— **Proof**: a proof assistant lemma over `PassengerCar` (tool choice is context‑local).
— **Reuse** to Plant‑B: a Scope Bridge with **CL=2** (rig bias) and a KindBridge with **CL^k=3** (same classification). Apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** for CL=2 and the **kind‑bridge penalty** for CL^k=3 to **R**.

---

#### B.5 LA lane — tests & monitoring that cover the right variants  \[A/I]

**What LA contributes.** Empirical assurance for claims with executable semantics or physical interfaces; especially when F ≤ F6 or when stochastic/real‑world effects matter.

**LA‑patterns (informative):**

* **Cover by subkind.** Test at least one representative per subkind; add more where variability inside a subkind matters.
* **Boundary probing.** Concentrate tests near **KindSignature** and **Scope** boundaries (e.g., temp limits, speed caps).
* **Hybrid checks (F6).** When software controllers interact with physical systems, ensure **both sides** declare obligations; include their interaction cases in the matrix.
* **Monitoring windows.** For live systems, define **Γ\_time policies** (e.g., rolling 30 d) and tie alerts to **kind‑aware metrics** (“error rate per `ServiceInstance`”).

**LA‑obligations (normative):**

* **LA‑1.** Each test campaign **SHALL** specify **rows/columns** in the evidence matrix and attach **Scope/MemberOf** predicates to each run.
* **LA‑2.** Freshness windows **SHALL** be explicit and enforced in guards (no “latest”).
* ***LA‑3.** If a **KindBridge** merges subkinds, test plans **SHALL** be adjusted (more cells, stricter acceptance), and the **kind‑bridge penalty** (based on CL^k) applied to **R**.
* **LA‑4.** Publishing **SpanUnion** coverage requires the independence note (which support lines differ).

**Mini‑example (LA).**
Claim: “For all `x ∈ Vehicle`: brakeDistance ≤ 50 m on dry, ≤ 40 m on wet.”
— **Rows**: `{PassengerCar, LightTruck}`.
— **Columns**: `{dry, ≤50}`, `{wet, ≤40}` with rigs and versions.
— **Cells**: PC/dry covered by track tests; LT/wet by simulation + surrogate tests (independent lines → SpanUnion allowed).
— **Bridge** to jurisdiction Y collapses EV vs ICE ⇒ `CL^k=2`. Apply **Ψ(2)** to **R**; add extra wet tests to compensate.

---

#### B.6 TA lane — tool qualification where it belongs  \[A/I]

**What TA contributes.** Confidence in **provers, checkers, model‑checkers, data classifiers** and pipelines. TA is about the **machinery**, not the **claim** or **kind** semantics.

**TA‑patterns (informative):**

* **Prover kernels.** Audit/qualification of the kernel version used for VA proofs.
* **Automated Model‑checkers.** Qualification against seeded faults; document limits (precision, nondeterminism).
* **Classifiers used for `MemberOf`.** If membership uses ML or rules engines, qualify the **classifier** separately; any drift monitoring belongs to LA freshness.

**TA‑obligations (normative):**

* **TA‑1.** Tools critical to VA/LA **SHALL** declare their qualification status and version; guards **SHALL** reference these declarations when they matter.
**TA‑2.** Lower tool qualification **MUST NOT** be hidden by relaxing **F** or widening **G**. target‑contexts may offset it by demanding **more evidence** in **R** (for example, extra tests), per policy.

---

#### B.7 Guard macros for evidence planning & attachment  \[A]

**Guard\_EvidencePlan\_Typed** — approve a plan that is adequate for a typed claim.
*Plain reading.* The first macro checks that the plan names the rows (kinds or masks) and columns (slices), that scope and membership can be checked for each cell, that any Cross‑context moves declare bridges, and that penalties are budgeted in **R**.

```
1. MatrixDeclared:    Evidence matrix rows = {subkinds or masks of k}; columns = {TargetSlices within ClaimScope}
2. ScopeBound:        For each column, ClaimScope covers that slice with explicit Γ_time
3. KindBound:         MemberOf(?, k, slice) is defined (deterministic) for all planned slices
4. BridgeBudgeted:    If cross-context:
                        (a) Scope Bridge(s) declared with CL → attach the **scope‑bridge penalty** to the **R** budget
                        (b) KindBridge(s) declared with CL^k → attach the **kind‑bridge penalty** to the **R** budget
5. FreshnessPolicy:   LA freshness windows specified per slice; monitoring plan defined (if live)
6. IndependenceNote:  If SpanUnion is claimed, independence justification attached
7. TADecls:           Tools and their TA status listed; residual risk routed to R (not to F/G)
```

**Guard\_EvidenceAttach\_Typed** — attach concrete evidence to a state change.
*Plain reading.* The second macro checks that each attached evidence unit clearly states which row and column it covers, binds scope and membership in a reproducible way, applies bridge penalties to **R**, and respects freshness.

```
1. CellMatch:         Each evidence unit cites (subkind/mask, slice) it covers
2. PredicateBinding:  Evidence embeds Scope and MemberOf predicates (or references them verifiably)
3. BridgeApplied:     If evidence is bridged, apply the **scope‑bridge** and/or **kind‑bridge** penalties to **R**; record loss notes
4. FreshnessMet:      Evidence within declared freshness; else guard fails closed
5. VA/LA Mix:         If VA present, verify it matches the quantified Kind; if LA fills gaps, show matrix deltas
6. TAConsistent:      Tool versions match TA declarations used at planning time
```

#### B.8 Anti‑patterns & remedies  \[I]

| Anti‑pattern                       | Why it’s risky                                | Remedy                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “We tested one golden case.”       | Hides variant risk; ignores subkinds.         | Build a subkind‑indexed matrix; add boundary tests per column.      |
| “Latest data suffices.”            | Non‑deterministic; un‑auditable.              | Declare `Γ_time` windows; fail closed on expiry.                    |
| “Tool is trusted, so we’re done.”  | Confuses TA with VA/LA; misses content risk.  | Keep TA separate; add VA proofs or LA tests as needed.              |
| Bridging without penalties         | Understates risk; mapping gaps surface later  | Apply **scope‑bridge** and **kind‑bridge** penalties to **R**; publish loss notes. |
| Widening G to cover evidence gaps. | Conflates applicability with available tests. | Keep G honest; expand matrix or lower claim scope explicitly (ΔG−). |
| Inferring scope from how many items match    | Scope is not the same as membership      | Keep **Scope** (where it applies) distinct from **membership** (which items match in the slice). |

#### B.9 End‑to‑end example (manager’s cheat‑sheet)  \[I]

**Scenario.** You want to publish “∀ x: PassengerCar. brakeDistance ≤ 50 m dry; ≤ 40 m wet” across two plants.

1. **Kinds.** `PassengerCar ⊑ Vehicle` (K2, signature F4).
2. **Scope (G).** `{surface in {dry, wet}, speed limits, rig version, time selector (Γ_time)=rolling 180 days}` in Plant‑A.
3. **VA.** Prove the property for **PassengerCar** using a proof assistant, and cite the **Scope** slices it assumes.
4. **LA.** Build an evidence matrix with rows `{PassengerCar}` and columns `{dry, up to 50}` and `{wet, up to 40}`, including rig variants; add boundary tests near the limits.
5. **TA.** Qualify the prover kernel and the automated checker used for wet surrogates.
6. **Bridge.** To Plant‑B: a **Scope Bridge** with **CL=2** (rig bias) and a **KindBridge** with **CL^k=3** (same classification).
7. **Penalties.** Apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** for CL=2 and the **kind‑bridge penalty** for CL^k=3 to **R**. Per policy, add extra test cells in Plant‑B to compensate for rig bias.
8. **Guards.** Use `Guard_EvidenceAttach_Typed` on the state change; include freshness checks.

**Outcome.** A defensible, auditable publication: typed, scoped, with clear evidence coverage and explicit risk penalties — no conflation of abstraction with applicability, and no tool risk smuggled into content.

### Annex C. ESG guards

**Status note.** This profile restates the guard semantics from **§4** for ESG/Method contexts. It does **not** add obligations; where wording diverges, **§4 controls**.

#### C.1 **ESG** guard obligations (normative)

When a state transition publishes or affirms a claim that quantifies over kinds, the guard **SHALL**:

1. **Scope coverage (USM).**
   `U.ClaimScope(Claim) covers TargetSlice` (singleton or finite set) and TargetSlice **declares `Γ_time`** (no “latest”).

2. **Typed definedness.**
   A **deterministic membership check** is available for every kind used by the claim in the **TargetSlice**. If membership cannot be evaluated in that context, the guard **fails closed**.

3. **Typed compatibility (same Context).**
 If a downstream consumer expects a specific kind, then for each kind used by the claim either:
* the used kind is an **is‑a / subkind‑of** the expected kind, or
* a documented **RoleMask** for the expected kind is used and its constraints are **met and observable** in the **TargetSlice**.

3. **Typed compatibility (Cross‑context).**
  If any referenced kind is **used across Contexts**, a **KindBridge** **SHALL** be declared with a published **type‑congruence level** (minimum acceptable level per Context policy), order preserved (no inversions), and **loss notes**.  
The guard **SHALL** apply the **kind‑bridge penalty** to **R**.

4. **Scope translation (Cross‑context claim use).**
If the Claim’s scope originates in another target‑context, a **Scope Bridge** with a published **congruence level** is required; apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** to **R**.

6. **Formality threshold (if gated).**
   If the ESG state requires rigor, enforce `U.Formality(Claim) ≥ F_k` (C.2.3).
   (*Note:* Raising F does **not** widen G; do not substitute.)

7. **Evidence freshness (R).**
   Where the new state implies trust, assert freshness windows and confirm **no expired bindings**.

**Prohibitions (normative).**

* Do **not** widen **G** to “hide” a type mismatch. Fix typed compatibility (introduce a subkind, use a RoleMask, publish a KindBridge) or reject.
* Do **not** treat a **mask name** as a kind—masks must be **registered** and **deterministic**.
* Do **not** infer G from the size of a kind’s **Extension**; **Scope ≠ Extension**.

---

#### C.2 · **Method–Work** guard obligations (normative)

To admit a **capability** for a specific **Work** step at **JobSlice**, the guard **SHALL**:

1. **Work scope coverage (USM).**
   The capability’s **Work scope** covers the **JobSlice**, and the **JobSlice** includes an explicit **time selector (Γ_time)**.


2. **Measures & qualification.**
   **All** required `U.WorkMeasures` hold at JobSlice and the `U.QualificationWindow` is **valid at `Γ_time`**.

3. **Typed inputs (same Context).**
   For each declared input kind (or RoleMask), assert:
   * **Membership check available:** the system can deterministically decide whether the input belongs to the expected kind in this **JobSlice**.
   * **Compatibility:** the provided input kind is an **is‑a / subkind‑of** the expected kind, or the **RoleMask** constraints are satisfied and observable.

3. **Typed outputs / post‑conditions (if declared).**
   If the capability guarantees an output kind `k_out`, record the obligation to **demonstrate** `MemberOf(output, k_out, JobSlice)` (typically via conformance tests or audits).

4. **Cross‑context typed use.**
   If inputs/outputs are typed in a different target‑context than the capability or JobSlice:
   * **KindBridge(s)** are required with a published **type‑congruence level** and **loss notes**; apply the **kind‑bridge penalty** to **R**.
   * If the capability resides in another target‑context, a **Scope Bridge** with a published **congruence level** is required; apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** to **R**.

4. **No substitution by G.**
   Do not “fix” a typed mismatch by widening the **Work scope**. Use an **adapter** or a **RoleMask**, or reject.

#### C.3 · Guard macros (ready‑to‑use)

**ESG\_TypedGate(Claim, TargetSlice, Kinds, thresholds)**
*Manager view:* The following macros are for editors; target‑contexts may automate them if desired. Managers can read the comments on each step; the checks are the same ones described in Plain language above.

```
1  assert ClaimScope(Claim) covers TargetSlice                 // USM
2  assert Γ_time(TargetSlice) is explicit                  // no "latest"
3  for each kind k in Kinds used by Claim:
4      assert membership_defined(k, TargetSlice)               // C.3.2 K-07
5  if same-Context typed expectations exist:
6      assert is_subkind(k, k_expected) OR meets_mask_constraints(k_expected, TargetSlice)
7  if cross-context kinds:
8      assert KindBridge(k, k') with type_congruence ≥ c_kind and loss notes
9      apply_kind_bridge_penalty(type_congruence)
10 if cross-context scope:
11     assert ScopeBridge(Claim.Context, TargetSlice.Context) with congruence ≥ c_scope
12     apply_scope_bridge_penalty(congruence)
13 if F-threshold applies: assert Formality(Claim) ≥ F_k        // C.2.3
14 if trust implied: assert Fresh(evidence, window) AND NoExpiredBindings
```

**MethodWork\_TypedGate(Capability, JobSlice, Inputs/Outputs, thresholds)**

```
1  assert WorkScope(Capability) covers JobSlice                // USM
2  assert Γ_time(JobSlice) is explicit
3  assert WorkMeasures(JobSlice) satisfied AND QualificationWindow holds
4  for each expected input-kind k_in:
5      assert membership_defined(k_in, JobSlice)
6      assert is_subkind(k_input, k_in) OR meets_mask_constraints(k_in, JobSlice)
7  if declared output-kind k_out: record obligation to show MemberOf(output,k_out,JobSlice)
8  if cross-context kinds: assert KindBridge(...) with type_congruence ≥ c_kind; apply_kind_bridge_penalty(type_congruence)
9  if cross-context capability/scope: assert ScopeBridge(...) with congruence ≥ c_scope; apply_scope_bridge_penalty(congruence)
```

#### C.4 · Worked examples (manager‑focused)

**(A) ESG — Promote a braking policy to *Effective*.**
*Claim.* “For all **vehicles**: braking distance is **≤ 50 m** on dry and **≤ 40 m** on wet.”
*TargetSlice.* `{surface∈{dry,wet}, speed≤50 km/h, rig=v3, Γ_time=rolling 180 d}`
*Kinds.* `Vehicle` (K2, `KindSignature` at F4); the consumer subsystem expects `PassengerCar`.
**Guard.**

1. **Scope** covers TargetSlice (USM ✓).
2. **Definedness** of `MemberOf(?, Vehicle, TargetSlice)` ✓.
3. **Typed compatibility:** `PassengerCar ⊑ Vehicle` ✓.
4. **No bridges** → no penalties.
5. **F‑threshold:** `Formality(Claim) ≥ F4` ✓.
6. **Freshness:** evidence ≤ 180 days ✓.
   **Result:** Transition allowed. F/R apply weakest‑link on support paths; G remains the set declared.

---

**(B) Method–Work — Admit “RiskScore” step with typed input.**
*Capability.* `ComputeRiskScore` expects `AuthenticatedRequest`; promises SLOs (latency ≤ 50 ms, error ≤ 0.5 %).
*JobSlice.* `{api=v2.3, region=eu‑west, Γ_time=now, traffic_class=gold}`
*Inputs.* Producer emits `Request` (no auth guarantee).
**Guard.**

1. **Work scope** covers JobSlice; **Measures** & **QualificationWindow** ✓.
2. **Typed inputs:** `MemberOf(?, AuthenticatedRequest, JobSlice)` must hold. Not true for raw `Request`.
3. **Remedy:** insert an **adapter** that enforces/attests auth → yields `AuthenticatedRequest`.
4. **No Cross‑context** → no bridges.
   **Result:** Admitted **with adapter**; Scope unchanged; R relies on adapter evidence. Widening Work scope is **not** acceptable to bypass typed mismatch.

---

**(C) Cross‑context ESG — Adopt policy across plants.**
*Claim Context.* `SafetyLab@2026`. *target Context.* `PlantB@EU`.
*Kinds.* `Vehicle ↦ TransportUnit` via **KindBridge** with **`CL^k=2`** (EV/ICE collapsed); **Scope Bridge** from lab to plant with **CL=2** (rig bias ±2 %).
**Guard.**

1. Translate **Scope** and **cover** `TargetSlice_B`.
2. Translate **Kind** and ensure `MemberOf(?, TransportUnit, TargetSlice_B)` is **defined**.
3. Apply the **scope‑bridge penalty (level 2)** and the **kind‑bridge penalty (level 2)** to **R**; publish loss notes.
   **Result:** Transition allowed with reduced **R**; G is the **mapped** set; F unchanged.

# **C.13 — Compose‑CAL (Constructional Mereology)**
*(architheory pattern; structural rung of the FPF ladder)*
**Status.** Normative architheory \[A]; notation‑agnostic; imports Kernel only.

### 1 Intent

Provide a single, generative calculus for part–whole structure so that **all** structural relations in FPF are *constructed* (not merely declared) from three primitives and thereby inherit extensional identity by design. The calculus is hidden from day‑to‑day users behind relation aliases; its artefacts are traces that witness how a whole arises from its parts.

Also known as *“Γₘ mereology”*, *“constructor‑based composition”*.

**Layer.** *calculus.*
**Depends on.** Kernel only (no upward imports).
**Consumed by.** CT2R‑LOG (B.3.5) Working‑Model alias logic and any architheory that needs part–whole semantics. Compose‑CAL does **not** import alias definitions; it merely emits traces that others may reference.

Compose‑CAL introduces a **single construction operator Γₘ** with exactly three constructors—**sum**, **set**, **slice**—sufficient to build structural wholes, collections‑as‑wholes, and aspects **without** extending the Kernel’s type set. No “parallel” or “temporal slice” constructor is added. Every construction yields a **trace** that serves as the witness for structure. Human‑facing relations such as *ComponentOf*, *MemberOf*, *AspectOf* are defined elsewhere as **Working‑Model aliases** and are *grounded* in these traces; Compose‑CAL itself remains purely generative and extensional.


### 2 Context & Problem

FPF presents a unified structural backbone used across disciplines. Historically, sub‑relations like *ComponentOf* or *MemberOf* were **declared** directly. This maximised usability but provided no generative guarantee that a new subtype was extensionally well‑behaved or reducible to common mereology.

Declared lists of part‑of sub‑relations **scale poorly** and **lack identity guarantees**. Engineers ask for a *single dial* (“is x part of y?”), while ontologists need a principled foundation that (a) avoids Kernel bloat and (b) proves that wholes are nothing over and above their parts. Adding yet another bespoke relation (e.g., *PortionOf*) should not entail schema surgery or ad‑hoc rules.

### 3 Forces

* **Parsimony (C‑5).** Add no core types if composition suffices; keep the constructor set minimal.
* **Minimal Kernel (P‑1).** Generativity must live in a plug‑in calculus, not in Kernel axioms.
* **Cognitive asymmetry.** Everyday users want “one part‑of query”; specialists accept complexity backstage.
* **Trans‑disciplinary unification.** Every architheory that needs mereology should reuse one *generative* basis.
* **Green‑field strictness.** With no legacy to break, we can require grounding for new structural edges.

## 4 Solution

### 4.1 Solution sketch

**Compose‑CAL SHALL provide Γₘ with three and only three constructors:**
1. **`Γₘ.sum(parts:Set[U.Entity])`** — returns a whole *W* such that each *p* in *parts* stands in **KernelPartOf(p, W)**.
2. **`Γₘ.set(elems:Set[U.Entity])`** — returns a **collection** *C*; each *e* in *elems* stands in a calculus‑internal **mero:KernelPartOf(e, C)** under **member‑as‑part** semantics (publication alias: typically **`ut:MemberOf`**). **Counts/order** (e.g., parallel/serial factors) are **not carried here**; they live in method/time families adjacent to structure.  *Note:* although `mero:KernelPartOf` is transitive in the calculus, the **published** `MemberOf` alias remains **non‑transitive** by design (see A.14 guards). 
3. **`Γₘ.slice(entity:U.Entity, facet:U.Facet)`** — returns an **aspect** *S* such that **mero:KernelPartOf(S, entity)** and *S* carries the declared **facet**. Temporal facets are excluded here.
   
+**Note.** The calculus names an internal backbone **`mero:KernelPartOf`**; the Kernel’s public `ut:PartOf`/**A.14** catalogue remain unchanged. Publish only via Working‑Model aliases (CT2R‑LOG).

+The calculus emits a **trace** for every construction; Structural aliases **MUST** be *grounded by* exactly one such trace.

**Non‑goals (clarifications).**
* No extra constructors for “parallelism” or “time slices”; parallelism is modelled via **set** (with order handled in `Γ_method`), and temporal parts live in the appropriate temporal/system calculus. This preserves parsimony.
* Compose‑CAL does not define user‑visible relation names; those belong to the alias layer.

### 4.2 Normative contract (high‑level)

* **C13‑N1.** *Extensional identity.* Two Γₘ results are identical iff they have the same parts under the same constructor and facet conditions.
* **C13-N2.** *Structural grounding stance.* Every **structural** edge **MUST** reference **exactly one** Γₘ trace as its grounding witness **and SHALL declare `validationMode = axiomatic`** (see B.3.5 / E.14). **Structural edges MUST NOT** be published in `postulate` or `inferential` stances.
* **C13‑N3.** *Algebraic laws.* `Γₘ.sum` and `Γₘ.set` are **commutative** and **idempotent** over their inputs; `Γₘ.slice` composes only by facet‑compatible refinement.
* **C13‑N4.** *Acyclicity & antisymmetry.* Structural part‑of induced by Γₘ is transitive, antisymmetric, and acyclic at the level of entities. *(Formal axioms appear later in this pattern.)*
* **C13‑N5.** *Separation of concerns.* Γₘ provides constructions and traces; naming, aliasing and human‑level relation taxonomies are defined outside Compose‑CAL (see B.3.5 for the CT2R‑LOG handshake).
* **C13‑N6.** *Member vs component.* `Γₘ.set` yields **collections** whose Working‑Model alias is **MemberOf**; authors **SHALL NOT** infer **ComponentOf** from **MemberOf** without a separate `Γₘ.sum` narrative.
* **C13‑N7.** *Domain guard.* Do **not** apply Compose‑CAL to roles, methods, or works (see A.12/A.15): these are outside mereology.

### 4.3 Scope, applicability, terms & notation

+Use Compose-CAL whenever a claim concerns **structural containment** of entities (assemblies, collections, aspects). Compose-CAL is *not* used for epistemic relations between knowledge artefacts; those are **epistemic** relations and may be justified by **Logical/Mapping** and/or **Empirical Validation** with an explicit `validationMode ∈ {inferential, postulate}`. Compose-CAL is neutral with respect to domain (mechanical, biological, software, etc.).

* **Γₘ** — the mereological construction operator of this calculus.
* **trace** — a minimal, inspectable witness that a constructor was applied to given inputs to yield a whole (or aspect).
* **structural part‑of** — the structural relation induced by Γₘ; user‑facing aliases (e.g., *ComponentOf*, *MemberOf*) are separate patterns that **must** point back to traces.
  
 **Alias readiness.** Typical CT2R mappings:  
* **ComponentOf** ⇢ `sum` narrative;  
* **MemberOf** ⇢ `set` narrative;  
* **AspectOf** ⇢ `slice` narrative;  
* **PortionOf** ⇢ `slice(entity, facet="material/spatial‑region")` **plus** metrical semantics (A.14);  
* **ConstituentOf** (logical/content) ⇢ `sum` narrative over conceptual parts. *(Material mixtures are **not** `ConstituentOf`; use `PortionOf` or `ComponentOf` per A.14.)*
 
### 5 · Archetypal Grounding *(System / Episteme duo)*

> **Tell–Show–Show.** Compose‑CAL is a thinking‑level calculus for building structural wholes from parts. We *show* it twice—first on a **System** (structural) and then on an **Episteme** case (where constructive grounding is *not* the primary mode).

#### 5.1 · **System** (structural; constructive grounding)

**Story.** A **Skid** is assembled from its **Pump**, **Motor**, **Baseframe**, and **Manifold**.

**Constructive grounding (Γ\_m).**
Narrate a *sum* of parts: “Skid = sum{Pump, Motor, Baseframe, Manifold}.” This uses **`Γ_m.sum`** to obtain a whole whose parts stand in **KernelPartOf**; the resulting Working‑Model relation engineers publish is **`ut:ComponentOf`** on each edge from part to whole. The mapping “*sum → ComponentOf*” reflects the intended aliasing between constructive traces and human‑facing mereology.

**Facets and collections.** 
Need the **inspection surface**? Narrate **`Γₘ.slice(Skid, "spatial")`** and publish **`ut:AspectOf`**. Need a group of **Transfer interactions**? Narrate **`Γₘ.set{…}`** and publish **`ut:MemberOf`**—this is a **collection-as-whole**, not a sub‑assembly; no component identity is implied without a separate **`Γₘ.sum`** narrative.

**Plane separation.**
Assembly **order** and **time** are *not* encoded here: parallel lines and schedules live in method/time families and are described adjacent to, not inside, the part‑tree.

#### 5.2 · **Episteme** (knowledge‑bearing; non‑constructive first)

**Story.** A **Mass‑Flow Representation** is used to stand for a measured flow in a plant dataset.

**Grounding choice.** 
Here the Working‑Model relation (e.g., **RepresentationOf**) is **epistemic**. Authors typically justify it by *inferential* or *postulate* stances (argument or calibration cues), not by a mereological construction; constructive traces remain optional. This preserves the firewall between structure and knowledge claims while keeping a clear path to stronger assurance if the team later reframes part of the representation structurally (e.g., sets of interactions as a **`Γ_m.set`** for a flow bundle).

#### 5.3 · Scope justification

* **Universality.** The trio **sum / set / slice** appears across mechanical assemblies, biological complexes, and organizational artifacts; aliasing to **ComponentOf / MemberOf / AspectOf** provides a stable Working‑Model surface for those domains.
* **Parsimony.** No “parallel” or “temporal slice” constructor is added; time slices belong in the temporal calculus, and parallelism is modelled as a **set** plus method metadata.

| **CC‑C13‑4 (No order/time in mereology).** | Authors **SHALL NOT** encode execution order, parallelism, or temporal coverage via constructors; such concerns belong to method/time planes and are stated adjacent to structure.             | Maintain the plane firewall.                                            |

> **Author’s note.** Compose‑CAL is a calculus for **constructive** reasoning about structure. Publishing remains in the **Working‑Model** layer (see B.3.5); constructive narratives are attached when the team seeks stronger assurance, never as a substitute for clear human‑facing relations.

### 8 · Consequences

**Benefits**

 * **Extensional clarity.** Every structural claim is reconstructed from `Γ_m.sum | Γ_m.set | Γ_m.slice`: **sum** establishes component‑assembly identity; **set** establishes collection identity; **slice** yields aspects as parts—without expanding the Kernel.
* **Human–first publication, formal–on‑demand.** Teams keep publishing **Working‑Model** relations (e.g., `ut:ComponentOf`), while **assurance** is attached as needed via a constructive grounding narrative and `tv:groundedBy` (see B.3.5).
* **Separation of planes preserved.** Order/parallelism and temporal coverage remain in `Γ_method` / `Γ_time`; structure is never overloaded to carry them, avoiding recurrent category errors.
* **Uniformity across domains.** The same triad models mechanical assemblies, socio‑technical memberships, and informational wholes without domain‑specific constructors or ad‑hoc exceptions.
* **Didactic economy.** Authors learn one compact calculus; reviewers gain a predictable place to look for constructive justification when `validationMode = axiomatic` (B.3.5 alignment).
* **Compositional reuse.** Traces are reusable fragments of reasoning; complex wholes are narratable as sums of sub‑traces, with sets for concurrency and slices for aspect selection.

**Trade‑offs / Mitigations**

* **Discipline cost at higher assurance.** Writing a concise grounding narrative for axiomatic claims takes effort. *Mitigation:* reuse the micro‑templates in this pattern’s Grounding section and keep narratives notation‑free.
* **Over‑use risk.** Temptation to treat collections as integrated assemblies. *Mitigation:* keep **MemberOf** distinct from **ComponentOf**; both `set` and `sum` yield wholes, but only **`sum`** establishes **component** structure and assembly identity.
* **Temporal leakage risk.** Authors may try to smuggle time into structure via “temporal slices.” *Mitigation:* use `Γ_time` for temporal statements and `slice` only for intensional aspects, not for time windows.

> **One‑line takeaway.** Compose‑CAL gives a minimal, universal *how‑it‑was‑built* story for any structural edge, without disturbing the human‑first publication surface defined in B.3.5.

### 9 · Rationale (informative)

**Why exactly three moves?**
`sum`, `set`, and `slice` are jointly sufficient and minimally overlapping:

* **`sum`** creates an **integrated whole** from parts and thereby establishes **component** structure (assembly identity).
* **`set`** creates a **collection‑as‑whole**; members are **parts of the collection** under member‑as‑part semantics, but **no component integration** is implied.
* **`slice`** returns an **aspect as part** of its bearer (facet‑constrained, e.g., spatial/material); temporal facets are excluded here.

All three moves create new entities; **sum** is the only move that establishes **component** identity. Neither `set` nor `slice` changes the identity of their inputs, and `set` never upgrades membership to component status. Temporal coverage and workflow order are handled in their own planes.

This separation mirrors long‑standing distinctions between composition, collection, and aspect, while enforcing **parsimony**: no additional constructors are introduced into the Kernel (C‑5). The calculus remains **notation‑agnostic**: its meanings are given in prose and mathematics; any diagrams are illustrative only, in line with the Notational‑Independence guard‑rail (E.5).

**Why constructive grounding lives outside the publication surface.**
FPF privileges **Working‑Model** relations as the canonical form for communication and design. Compose‑CAL supplies the **constructive shoulder** of the **Assurance Layer**: when authors choose `validationMode = axiomatic`, they narrate the whole as a `sum` of parts (with optional `set` and `slice` scaffolding) and point to that narrative via `tv:groundedBy`. This keeps the text readable while preserving a path to stronger assurance (B.3 family, Authoring Template).

**Why order/time are out of scope.**
Correctness‑by‑sequence and temporal coverage are orthogonal to **parthood**. Encoding them as parts breeds contradictions (e.g., “phase‑as‑component”). Compose‑CAL deliberately refuses any “serial/parallel/temporal constructor,” delegating such concerns to `Γ_method` and `Γ_time` and aligning with B.1’s flavour separation.

---

### 10 · Relations

**Builds on**

* **A.14 Advanced Mereology.** Uses its structural catalogue (Component/Portion/Aspect vs Member) as the *target* of constructive narratives; never collapses Member into Part.
* **E.5 Guard‑Rails (Notational Independence).** Meanings are given in prose; diagrams are illustrative only.  
* **E.5 Guard‑Rails (Unidirectional Dependency).** Compose‑CAL depends **downward** only; it never imports alias layers or higher planes.
* **E.8 Authoring Conventions.** Conforms to the canonical pattern template (Grounding section for `[A]` patterns; CC placement).

**Coordinates with**
* **B.3.5 CT2R‑LOG.** `tv:groundedBy` refers (conceptually) to Compose‑CAL traces when `validationMode = axiomatic`; **Working‑Model** relations remain the publication interface.
* **B.1 flavours.** Keeps order (`Γ_method`) and time (`Γ_time`) outside structure; may co‑appear in narratives when relevant but never as constructors.
* **Kind-CAL / Lang‑CHR.** Provide the Mapping shoulder of assurance (labels, type alignment) that complements constructive narratives in this pattern.
* **KD‑CAL.** Provides the Logical shoulder when authors justify relations inferentially instead of constructively.
* **C.16 (Measurement substrate).** Supplies quantitative hooks when a constructive narrative benefits from explicit counts/ratios (e.g., cardinalities, coverage), while keeping metrics distinct from mereology.

**Constrains**
* Any architheory that **creates** or **reasons about** structural wholes SHOULD narrate them using only `sum | set | slice`.
* Structural publication MUST NOT encode order/time; such claims belong to their dedicated flavours.
* Introducing new structural constructors requires a separate parsimony argument and is discouraged unless the triad cannot narrate the case without ambiguity.

**Provides**
* A minimal generative basis (`Γ_m.sum | Γ_m.set | Γ_m.slice`) and the corresponding reading discipline for constructive narratives.
* A stable interface with CT2R‑LOG for `tv:groundedBy` links under `validationMode = axiomatic`.


# C.16 (MM‑CHR) — Measurement & Metrics Characterization (Architheory)  \[A]

## 1 · Intent (Normative)

**Name.** *Measurement & Metrics Characterization (MM‑CHR).* This is user-oriented name: in user‑facing narrative we say ‘metrics’; in Tech register we speak `U.MetricTemplate`/`U.Measure`.
**Intent.** Provide a **transdisciplinary substrate for measurement** that any architheory can rely on: a small, stable set of intensional constructs and relations—**`U.MetricTemplate`**, **`U.Measure`**, **`U.Unit`**, **`U.EvidenceStub`**—disciplined by **CSLC** (*Characteristic / Scale / Level / Coordinate*) so that every recorded value is **interpretable** and **comparable** across CG‑frames (physics lab time‑of‑flight, figure‑skating judging, architectural modularity, etc.). **C.16** does **not** re‑define **Characteristic** (A.17) nor the CSLC kernel contract (A.18); instead, it **exports** the measurement substrate that *binds* an architheory’s metric notions to **one Characteristic and one Scale** and frames a **conceptual link to evidence**. This characterization is **notation‑neutral**, **tool‑agnostic**, and **open‑ended** (no “lifecycle” narrative; evolution proceeds via **RSG** moves with checklists). 

**Outcomes.**
(1) A uniform way for architheories to *declare* what is measured and *read* what has been measured; (2) explicit **Characteristic anchoring** and **Scale typing** per CSLC; (3) principled **comparability** and **polarity** (declared at the template level); (4) **traceability** via conceptual evidence stubs; (5) seamless alignment with cross‑domain quantity notions (ISO 80000, ISO/IEC 25024, QUDT, SOSA/SSN, Verspoor) through Unification rows (Part F). 

## 2 · Scope & Status (Normative)

**Scope.** **C.16** specifies the **measurement substrate** for FPF architheories: the roles of `U.MetricTemplate`, `U.Measure`, `U.Unit`, `U.EvidenceStub`; their **CSLC discipline**; the notions of **Scale type**, **polarity**, **comparability**, and **evidence sufficiency** at the level of *conceptual conditions*. It **exports** these constructs for all architheories (KD‑CAL, Arch‑CAL, etc.) without prescribing domain formulae or procedures. 

**Status.** **Normative architheory.** C.16 **depends on** A.17 (canonical **Characteristic**) and A.18 (minimal **CSLC** in Kernel). Where C.16 cites external CG‑frames, the stance is through **Part F** rows and **Bridges** (with CL and loss notes), not by vocabulary import. 

**Out of scope.** No computational recipes, no workflow prescriptions, no governance/process guidance. C.16 concerns **objects of thought** (intensions) and their **validity conditions**, not records or tooling. (Implementation guidance, if any, belongs outside Part C.)

---

## 3 · Problem & Context (Informative)

### 3.1 The problem C.16 solves

Across architheories, people say “score”, “metric”, “rating”, “property”. Without a shared substrate, numbers drift: *42 of what? on which scale? comparable to whom?* C.16 eliminates drift by requiring every metric notion to **bind** to **one** Characteristic and **one** Scale, and by **separating** intensional anchors from descriptions and gauges. The result is **portable meaning**: a measure is always readable as a **Coordinate on a declared Scale of a named Characteristic**, with a principled path to evidence. 

### 3.2 Context and prior art

* **Kernel canon.** A.17 makes **Characteristic** the sole canonical anchor for measurability; A.18 fixes **CSLC** as the minimal sufficiency for interpretability. C.16 relies on both.
* **Cross‑domain alignment.** The MM‑CHR family already maps FPF U.Types to **ISO 80000‑1 (Quantity)**, **ISO/IEC 25024 (Data‑quality Characteristic)**, **QUDT (QuantityKind/QuantityValue)**, **W3C SOSA/SSN (Observable/Observed/Result)**, and domain “feature/metric” usage (Verspoor, TF Metrics). C.16 uses these rows **as Bridges** (Part F), preserving local senses and documenting losses.  
* **Open‑ended evolution.** FPF replaces “lifecycle” with **Reachable‑States Graph (RSG)**: movement is along **certified states** with checklists; measurement work adopts the same open‑endedness (re‑entry allowed when distinctions change). C.16 uses RSG to frame **readiness** and **revision** of metric notions conceptually (no processes implied).

---

## 4 · Forces (Informative)

**F1 — Interpretability first.** A value detached from its Characteristic/Scale is meaningless; CSLC supplies minimum context.
**F2 — Transdisciplinarity.** Physics, architecture, curation, sport judging—*one* substrate must cover all while respecting scale types and polarity.
**F3 — Intension vs description.** Confusing the **Characteristic** (intensional object) with its rubric or exemplar text (descriptions) corrupts claims; C.16 keeps them distinct.
**F4 — Comparability without coercion.** Ordinal ≠ interval; ratio admits unit change, ordinal does not; polarity matters for “better/worse”. C.16 encodes these **as conceptual constraints**, not formulas.
**F5 — Evidence sufficiency.** A measure should be *checkable in principle*; evidence is a **conceptual link** (not storage advice).
**F6 — Lexical discipline.** One canon in normative register; narrative labels are didactic only (Part E). C.16 reuses E.10’s **register mapping**.

---

## 5 · Solution Outline (Normative)

**S1 — Exported objects.** C.16 **exports** four intensional constructs to be used by any architheory:

1. **`U.MetricTemplate`** — the *binding* of **one `U.Characteristic`** to **one Scale form**, with declared **polarity** and a conceptual **compatibility claim** (what counts as “same‑scale” for comparison). It is an *intensional specification*, not a record layout.
2. **`U.Measure`** — an *assertion* that a **subject** occupies a **Coordinate** (or **Level**, if discrete) on that Scale; the measure **references** its template and carries a **conceptual pointer to evidence** (`U.EvidenceStub`).
3. **`U.Unit`** — the *unit kind* associated with the Scale where applicable (physical quantities, normalized “points”, “stars”, “%”); unit coherence is part of comparability conditions.
4. **`U.EvidenceStub`** — a *conceptual locator* of grounds for the asserted value (type, identifier, brief summary, optional integrity notion); sufficiency criteria are **conceptual** (see §9, later).

**S2 — Comparability stance.** C.16 states **conceptual comparability** conditions: *same Characteristic*, *compatible Scale type and parameters*, *unit coherence* for interval/ratio; **no** forced coercions for nominal/ordinal; any score‑producing gauge **must be monotone** w\.r.t. template polarity. (Details: §7–§8 in later parts.)

**S3 — Evidence stance.** A measure that, by its template, **requires** evidence, is **inadmissible** without a meaningful `U.EvidenceStub`. C.16 defines **what it means conceptually** for evidence to “connect” the subject, the Characteristic, and its symbolic description; mechanisms are out of scope. (Details: §9 in later parts.)

**S4 — RSG framing (open‑endedness).** Readiness, calibration, and revision of metric notions are expressed as **RSG node moves with checklists** (e.g., “characteristic anchored”, “Scale typed”, “Unit coherent”, “Gauge declared”), allowing **re‑entry** when distinctions change; there is no terminal “lifecycle”. (Details: §10, later.)

---

### 5.1 · Lexical Discipline & Registers (Normative)

**L1 — Canon.** Use **Characteristic / Scale / Level / Coordinate / Score / Unit / Gauge** in **Tech** register; their `U.*` counterparts in **Formal**; narrative labels (e.g., *axis*, *points*, *stars*) are **didactic only** at first‑mention mapped to canon (E.10). 
**L1‑bis — “metric”.** The noun *metric* is **not** a Tech‑register canonical token for measurables; use **Characteristic / Scale / Coordinate / Score / Gauge**. It **may** appear in the architheory title and in the Formal names `U.MetricTemplate` / `U.Measure`. Do not use *metric* as a synonym for **Characteristic** or **Score** in normative prose.
**L2 — Intension vs Description.** Keep **intensional objects** (`U.MetricTemplate`, `U.Characteristic`) distinct from **descriptions** (rubrics, exemplars) and from **claims** (`U.Measure`). No collapsing of names across these layers.
**L3 — No synonym sprawl.** In normative clauses do **not** substitute *dimension/axis/property/feature* for **Characteristic**; A.17 governs canonicalization. (C.16 inherits A.17’s rename policy.)
**L4 — Bridge‑only unification.** Cross‑vocabulary sameness appears only via **F.9 Bridges** with **CL** and **loss notes**; C.16’s lexicon is the *source* side for measurement rows.
**L5 — “Metric” in registers.** In **Tech/Formal** avoid the noun *metric* as a primitive; use `U.MetricTemplate` / `U.Measure` / **Score**. In **Plain** register *metric* MAY denote “a Template+Measure family” on first mention, with an explicit pointer to canonical terms.

## 5.2 · Relations (pointers; details later)

**To A.17 / A.18.** C.16 *uses* A.17’s canonical **Characteristic** and A.18’s **CSLC sufficiency**; it neither re‑states nor weakens them.
**To Part F.** C.16 is the **exporting architheory** behind measurement rows in UTS/Bridges (e.g., **result‑value** ↔ SOSA `Result`, ISO `QuantityValue`).
**To Arch‑CAL.** Architectural qualities (*Coupling, Cohesion, Evolvability*) become **Characteristics** measured via C.16 templates; architectural dynamics read as trajectories in **CharacteristicSpace** (A.17 context).

## 5.3 · Normative Core Model (types & contracts)

> **Position.** MM‑CHR does **not** redefine kernel terms; it **binds** them to an architheory‑level contract that every metric must satisfy. Canonical vocabulary and CSLC duties are inherited from **A.17**/**A.18** and referenced here without duplication.
> 
> **Source of Truth** A.17/A.18 are the sole sources of truth for Canon and CSLC; C.16 **adopts by reference** and **forbids restatements** of their definitions. C.16 only **exports** `U.*` constructs, comparability stance, evidence semantics, and RSG touch‑points.

### 5.3.1 `U.MetricTemplate` — the metric definition (normative)

**Role.** An intensional **contract** that fixes *what is measured* and *how values must be read*—without producing any values itself. It is a *Definition*, not a Measure.

**R‑MT‑1 (CSLC anchor).** A MetricTemplate **SHALL** bind to **exactly one** `U.Characteristic` and **exactly one** **Scale‑form** admissible for that Characteristic (cf. A.18). Level is **optional** (used when the scale is enumerated); otherwise values are given directly as Coordinates.

**R‑MT‑2 (Unit).** If the scale carries units (interval/ratio), the template **SHALL** designate a **Unit** of presentation. For ordinal/nominal scales, unit may be absent or a nominal label (e.g., “stars”). (Old MM‑CHR Annex A already listed these structural elements; here we fix the conceptual obligation. )

**R‑MT‑3 (Polarity).** For any ordered scale, the template **SHALL** declare polarity (*higher‑is‑better / lower‑is‑better / target‑is‑best*), used by downstream gauges and comparisons (see §6). A **targeted** Scale **SHALL** declare at the Template: (a) the **target value**, (b) the **tolerance semantics** (e.g., symmetric band ±δ, or asymmetric bands), and (c) the **monotone fall‑off** convention outside the band. Any 𝒢 derived from a targeted Scale **MUST** be piecewise‑monotone toward the target and respect the declared tolerance semantics.

**R‑MT‑4 (Applicability).** A template **SHALL** state the **applicability frame** (what kinds of subjects it meaningfully applies to) in conceptual terms; this is a property of the definition, not of any measure.

**R‑MT‑5 (Intension vs description).** The template is an **intensional object**. Any rubric, checklist, or prose that explains it is a **Description**; they are related but not identical (E.10 discipline).

**R‑MT‑6 (Cardinality hint).** A Template **MAY** declare its intended **cardinality semantics** for a subject within a **time stance** (e.g., *latest‑only*, *at‑most‑one‑per‑day*, *time series*).
Where declared, claims outside that semantics are **inadmissible conceptually** (they must be reframed or versioned). *Purpose:* prevent silent duplicates and mixed regimes without imposing storage logic.

 **R‑MT‑7 (MAY):** “`UncertaintyPolicy` — optional conceptual guidance on how uncertainty is expressed/read (e.g., band/CI/quantile), without prescribing methods/tools.
    

### 5.3.2 `U.Measure` — the recorded reading (normative)

**Role.** A **claim** that a subject occupies a **Coordinate** (or named **Level**) on the template’s scale, backed by a minimal pointer to its grounds.

**R‑ME‑1 (Template binding).** Every Measure **SHALL** reference exactly one MetricTemplate; its **Value/Coordinate** must be **valid** for that template’s scale (type, range, category).

**R‑ME‑2 (Subject).** A Measure **SHALL** identify its **subject‑of‑measurement** (the bearer) unambiguously in the same Context of meaning as the template’s applicability frame.

**R‑ME‑3 (Evidence stub).** Where the template requires it, a Measure **SHALL** include an **EvidenceStub**—a conceptual pointer sufficient to support independent reasoning about the claim’s origin. (The old spec framed this as “traceability/provenance”; we keep only the **conceptual** role here. )

**R‑ME‑4 (Time stance).** A Measure **SHALL** carry a **time stance** (e.g., “as‑observed at T”, or “as‑aggregated over W”), expressed conceptually; it disambiguates the reading’s intended window without prescribing formats.

**R‑ME‑5 (Entity vs relation).** If the Characteristic is **relational**, the subject is a **tuple** (pair, k‑tuple); the wording of the claim reflects that arity and the template’s relation topology (cf. A.17).

R‑ME‑6 (MAY):** “`UncertaintyStub` — optional conceptual pointer to the adopted uncertainty estimation for this Measure, **if** required by the template.

> *Informative anchor.* The old Annex B example “Article Completeness” illustrates the split template/measure/evidence; **C.16** keeps the split but forbids storage‑level talk.

### 5.3.3 `U.Unit` — semantics of quantities (normative)

**Role.** A conceptual marker of **quantity kind** and admissible **conversions** within that kind; not every scale requires it.

**R‑UN‑1 (Quantity kind).** Where units apply, the template **SHALL** indicate the **quantity kind** (e.g., Time, Length, Dimensionless‑Score). Units are meaningful only **within** one kind.

**R‑UN‑2 (Convertibility).** Comparisons across different units are permitted **iff** they are **convertible** by kind‑preserving transformation (ratio/interval scales); for ordinal/nominal scales, no numeric conversions exist. (Old Annex A listed conversion hints; here we assert the conceptual boundary. )

**R‑UN‑3 (Canonical labels).** `%` denotes “fraction×100”; “points” denotes dimensionless magnitudes used for scores; “stars” denotes discrete ordinal marks. These are **labels** of representation, not new characteristics.

**R‑UN‑4 (Quantity‑kind bridge).** A Template on an interval/ratio Scale **SHOULD** name the underlying **quantity kind** (e.g., ISO 80000/QUDT category) to enable safe external bridges. This does **not** import external vocabularies; it declares an alignment point.

### 5.3.4 `U.EvidenceStub` — pointer to grounds (normative)

**Role.** A compact **tie** from a Measure to the grounds sufficient for **reasoned audit** (not a repository prescription).

**R‑EV‑1 (Minimal sufficiency).** An EvidenceStub **SHALL** carry, at minimum, a **type‑of‑ground** and an **identifier** sufficient to retrieve or reconstruct the grounds in the appropriate Context of meaning.

**R‑EV‑2 (Compositionality).** Multiple grounds may be **composed** as a finite set; composition is **commutative/associative/idempotent** at the level of stubs, enabling conceptual merge of corroborations.

**R‑EV‑3 (Soundness axiom).** A Measure **is admissible** only if at least one **auditable chain of grounds** can be stated from the bearer to the Characteristic via an appropriate Description (Object–Concept–Symbol triangle in the episteme). (The old text motivates “transparency/trust”; **C.16** states the conceptual admission rule. )

## 5.4 · Polarity, Comparability, and Gauges (normative)

> **Notation.** To avoid clashes with the kernel’s global aggregation symbol, this architheory denotes a gauge mapping by **𝒢** (calligraphic 𝒢).

**R‑POL‑1 (Declared polarity).** Every ordered scale **SHALL** declare polarity at the **template**. Any Gauge **𝒢** must be **monotone** with that polarity.

**R‑CMP‑1 (Comparability conditions).** Two readings are **directly comparable** when they share **Characteristic**, **scale type**, and **unit** (or unit is convertible within one quantity kind). Otherwise, comparability requires an explicitly declared **𝒢** on a common representation.

**R‑G𝒢‑1 (Gauge disclosure).** If a metric issues a **Score**, its Gauge **𝒢 : Coordinate → Score** **SHALL** be named with a **bounded codomain** and stated monotonicity. (The old text discussed “score ranges” and mapping; **C.16** keeps only the conceptual duty. )

**R‑G𝒢‑2 (Ordinal respect).** For ordinal inputs, **𝒢** must be **order‑preserving**; interval assumptions **MUST NOT** be smuggled in.

---

## 5.5 · Entity vs Relation bindings (normative clarifications)

**R‑ER‑1 (Arity preservation).** If the Characteristic is `U.EntityCharacteristic`, the subject is **one** bearer; if `U.RelationCharacteristic`, the subject is a **k‑tuple** (k ≥ 2). The Measure’s claim text **SHALL** reflect this arity.

**R‑ER‑2 (Relation scale).** Relation‑valued scales **SHALL** fix their symmetry/antisymmetry and directionality (e.g., distance symmetric; influence directional), at the **template** level.

**R‑ER‑3 (Bridge to CG‑frames).** In architectural CG‑frames, **Coupling/Cohesion** are Characteristics over **modules** (structure) or **roles** (function). Their measures are relational (**Coupling**) or unary (**Cohesion** within an element), but both live in the same MM‑CHR substrate. (Alignment hinted in the old mapping rows across contexts. )

---

## 5.6 · Acceptance (conceptual, RSG‑aware)

> Acceptance here is **thought‑level**. It uses the **Reachable‑States Graph (A.2.5)** pattern to organise mental checks—no “lifecycle” narratives.

**SCR‑C16‑A (Template sufficiency).** You can traverse **N1→N3** (Characteristic fixed → Scale typed → Unit coherent) for the template **without** invoking any implementation artifacts (cf. A.18 RSG alignment).

**SCR‑C16‑B (Reading sufficiency).** For a given subject, you can traverse **N4→N6** (Gauge named where needed → exemplar‑anchored sense → reading established) with polarity and arity explicit.

**SCR‑C16‑C (Comparability).** When two readings are placed side‑by‑side, you can state in one breath whether they are **comparable as‑is** or only **after 𝒢**, and **why**.

**SCR‑C16‑D (Evidence adequacy).** For any required EvidenceStub, you can sketch at least one **auditable chain of grounds** from the subject to the Characteristic via a Description in the right Context.

* **A.17 (CHR‑NORM).** Canonical **Characteristic** and Entity/Relation split; lexical rules and alias sunset.
* **A.18 (CSLC‑KERNEL).** One Characteristic + one Scale per template; Level optional; operation guard by scale type.

| **Nominal**  | =, ≠           | mode, frequencies | —                  | —                        | counts, proportions                                   | averaging labels; ordering categories without a declared order      |
| **Ordinal**  | <, =, > (rank) | median, quantiles | **not meaningful** | —                        | order‑respecting summaries (median rank, percentiles) | arithmetic mean of ranks; variance on ranks; linear blends of ranks |
| **Interval** | <, =, >        | mean location     | Δ meaningful       | ratio **not** meaningful | mean, sd of **differences**, correlation              | ratio claims (“twice as hot” in °C); geometric mean                 |

**Guards.**
G‑1 (Order). On ordinal, any transform used inside 𝒢 **MUST** be **monotone**.
G‑2 (Differences). On interval/ratio, **Δ** is legitimate; on ordinal/nominal, it is **undefined**.
G‑3 (Ratios). Only ratio Scales admit **x/y** semantics; interval/ordinal/nominal do not.
G‑4 (Unit coherence). Interval/ratio arithmetic presumes compatible units (or declared conversion).
G‑5 (Target polarity). If polarity is “targeted”, comparison is via distance‑from‑target, not simple ↑/↓.

*(These rules line up with the MM‑CHR exposition of CSLC and term discipline; A.17 fixes the lexical side.)* 

## 7 · Evidence Semantics (Normative)

### 7.1  What an Evidence Stub is (and is not)

**Definition.** `U.EvidenceStub` is a **conceptual pointer** that ties a **measure** to the **grounds** sufficient for independent checking (observations, arguments, lawful transformations). It is not the run log, not the carrier, and not the intensional characteristic itself. This keeps **intension–description–specification** distinct per E.10.D2 and the Clarity Lattice.

**Rule Σ‑1.** Whether evidence is **required** is a **property of the metric template**; if required, each `U.Measure` **SHALL** include an `U.EvidenceStub`.
**Rule Σ‑2.** Evidence composition is **commutative, associative, idempotent** at the concept level (sets/multisets of grounds); combining grounds can never *reduce* what is knowable about the measure’s warrant.
**Rule Σ‑3.** *Soundness minimum:* there exists a conceptual chain linking **bearer → Characteristic → Scale/Unit → admissible method/episteme**. (No “free‑floating numbers”.)
**Rule Σ‑4.** Declared *agreement* constructs (e.g., dual readings, panels) **MUST** be appropriate to the scale type (rank concordance for ordinal; tolerances for interval/ratio).
*Anchors:* MM‑CHR units/evidence notion; Strict Distinction and the separation of objects from their descriptions/specs.

## 8 · Integration with RSG & Dynamics (Normative/Clarifying)

### 8.1  RSG (Role‑State Graph) touch‑points

MM‑CHR **supplies recognisers** used in **State Checklists**. A checklist criterion **may** refer to a measure (e.g., “Cohesion ≥ T on ordinal ladder”), but the **state itself remains intensional**; the checklist is its **description**, and a **StateAssertion** is an evidence‑backed verdict over a Window. No lifecycle language is implied; RSGs are open‑ended graphs with re‑entry edges.

**Rule RSG‑M1.** When a checklist cites a measure, it **SHALL** do so by **Characteristic + Scale semantics** (and unit if applicable), not by colloquial aliases; Tech/Formal registers apply. **Rule RSG‑M2.** Thresholds in checklists **MUST** respect the scale type (no ratio talk on interval scales; no arithmetic on ordinal ladders).

### 8.2  Dynamics & CharacteristicSpace

`U.Dynamics.stateSpace` is a **CharacteristicSpace**—a named set of Characteristics with units/topology. MM‑CHR provides the **measurement side** of that space; architheories specify the **transition law**. Architectural or epistemic **dynamics** are then *trajectories in the declared CharacteristicSpace*. **No** procedural or storage commitments are implied.

## 9 · Conformance Checklist (Normative)

> *Thought‑level acceptance conditions for authors and reviewers; they constrain meaning, not tooling.*

**CC‑MCHR‑1 · CSLC anchoring.** Each `U.MetricTemplate` binds **exactly one** `U.Characteristic` and **exactly one** scale; each `U.Measure` carries a value valid for that scale (cf. A.18).
**CC‑MCHR‑2 · Polarity declared.** Every **ordered** scale in a template declares **polarity**; any **Score** via 𝒢 is monotone w\.r.t. that polarity.
**CC‑MCHR‑3 · Unit coherence.** Claims that compare or combine values are **grounded in unit coherence** (or declared conversions for interval/ratio).
**CC‑MCHR‑4 · Comparability honesty.** Ordered comparisons are asserted **only** when §7.2 holds; otherwise authors use qualitative/set‑level language.
**CC‑MCHR‑5 · Evidence sufficiency.** Where evidence is required by the template, the measure’s grounds are **conceptually sufficient** to retrace the claim; composition respects Σ‑laws (§8).
**CC‑MCHR‑6 · RSG alignment.** If a measure gates a **state** in an RSG, the checklist criteria **respect scale semantics** and the **intensional vs description** split. No lifecycle phrasing; use RSG open‑ended moves.
**CC‑MCHR‑7 · Dynamics awareness.** Where discussions involve change, the **CharacteristicSpace** is **named** (characteristics, units, topology) and separated from the **transition law** (architheory side).
**CC‑MCHR‑8 · Lexical guard‑rails.** Tech identifiers and headings use **Characteristic/Scale/Level/Value/Score/Unit/Gauge**; aliases (axis/dimension/points/stars) appear **only** in explanatory Plain register with a first‑mention mapping to the Tech canon.

### 10 · Invariants & Anti‑Patterns *(Normative unless marked “Informative”)*

#### 10.1 Invariants (N‑rules)

**N‑1 — One Characteristic + one Scale per template.**
Every `U.MetricTemplate` binds *exactly one* **Characteristic** and *exactly one* **Scale** (its type + admissible range or level‑set). This is the CSLC sufficiency condition for interpretability.

**N‑2 — Value validity.**
A `U.Measure` holds a **Value** that is *admissible* for the template’s Scale (numeric range, categorical level); when a **Level** is used, it is among the named rungs declared for that Scale.

**N‑3 — Polarity is declared at the template.**
For ordered Scales, the template states the comparison direction (↑ better / ↓ better / target‑is‑best). Any **Gauge mapping** to **Score** preserves that monotonic ordering. *(Note: we use “Gauge mapping” instead of the Greek letter used elsewhere in FPF to avoid symbol conflicts.)*

**N‑4 — Unit coherence.**
Within one template there is one *primary* **Unit** of expression (or an explicit level‑set for non‑numeric Scales). Conversions are conceptually allowed only where the Scale supports meaningful arithmetic (interval/ratio); nominal/ordinal Scales are not subject to numeric conversions.

**N‑5 — Comparability guard.**
Two Measures are comparable *iff* they share the same template (hence, the same Characteristic + Scale + Unit) **or** stand in an explicit equivalence declared via the Unification suite (F‑cluster Bridges). Otherwise, comparability is not presumed.

**N‑6 — Evidence as conceptual anchoring.**
If a template requires it, each Measure includes an **EvidenceStub** that conceptually links the Value to its grounds; absence where required makes the Measure inadmissible for use. *(This is a conceptual obligation; no process mechanics are implied.)*

**N‑7 — Arity clarity.**
If the Characteristic is relational (applies to a pair/tuple), the subject of measurement is the relation itself; the reading must not be re‑described as a unary property of either participant.

**N‑8 — Open‑ended evolution; graph, not lifecycle.**
When MM‑CHR is used in change reasoning, movement happens in a **CharacteristicSpace** and along a reachable‑states graph (RSG). There is no lifecycle terminal; revisions may re‑enter earlier framing nodes as per A.17. *(Conceptual control structure only.)*

---

#### 10.2 Anti‑Patterns (A‑rules) — with cures

**A‑1 — Scale drift under the same template.**
*Smell:* the Scale meaning (bounds, categories) shifts while the template ID remains.
*Cure:* version the template; declare the relation in the Unification suite.

**A‑2 — Arithmetic on ordinal.**
*Smell:* averaging “stars” or ranking labels as if they were intervals.
*Cure:* either keep order‑respecting operations only, or introduce a Gauge mapping that defines a proper Score range.

**A‑3 — Unit soup.**
*Smell:* mixing milliseconds and seconds for the same template, or “%” and “points” for one Scale.
*Cure:* one primary Unit per template; conversions (when meaningful) are declared conceptually, not ad‑hoc.

**A‑4 — Alias leakage.**
*Smell:* “axis/dimension/point/ladder” in normative identifiers or headings.
*Cure:* use only canonical tokens in normative prose; narrative labels are allowed *solely* in Plain register with first‑mention mapping (A.17).

**A‑5 — Multi‑Characteristic stuffing.**
*Smell:* one template tries to carry a vector of Values for several Characteristics.
*Cure:* separate templates (one Characteristic each) and compose coordinates explicitly when needed.

**A‑6 — Evidence afterthought.**
*Smell:* Measures required to have grounds are introduced without an intelligible EvidenceStub.
*Cure:* treat the EvidenceStub as part of the measurement claim itself, not an accessory.

**A‑7 — Template mutation after Measures exist.**
*Smell:* retro‑editing Characteristic/Scale/Unit of an active template.
*Cure:* immutability of that triad post‑use; publish a successor template if the concept changes.

**A‑8 — Score‑of‑everything.**
*Smell:* collapsing heterogeneous Values into a single “points” Score without declared Gauge mapping.
*Cure:* retain the Value on its Scale; add an explicit Gauge only when there is a justified need for a Score.

### 11 · Cross‑Domain Vignettes *(Informative, transdisciplinary)*

> *Each vignette shows an CSLC‑conformant template → measure, without duplicating the A.17/A.18 glossaries.*

**V‑A (Architecture — relational property).**
Characteristic: **Coupling** (relational) between modules; Scale: ordinal {Low, Med, High}; Unit: level‑labels; Polarity: ↓ better.
Reading: subsystem pair ⟨M₁, M₂⟩ gets **Med**; Gauge (optional) maps levels monotonically to a bounded Score for comparative dashboards.

**V‑B (Physics — interval/ratio).**
Characteristic: **ResponseTime**; Scale: ratio with non‑negative reals; Unit: seconds; Polarity: ↓ better.
Reading: subject S has **0.237 s**; comparability holds with any template that declares the same Characteristic+Scale+Unit (or an explicit equivalence).

**V‑C (Performing arts — ordinal).**
Characteristic: **EdgeControlQuality**; Scale: ordinal levels 1…5; Unit: level‑labels; Polarity: ↑ better.
Reading: performance P gets **4**; any aggregation uses a declared Gauge that respects order.

**V‑D (AI ethics — ratio).**
Characteristic: **ParityGap** (difference of positive rates); Scale: interval with symmetric bounds; Unit: percentage points; Polarity: ↓ better (0 is target).
Reading: model M on cohort C shows **3.2 pp**; evidence points conceptually to the derivation rationale (inputs, reference cohorts).

### 12 · Relations & Placement *(Informative)*

**Kernel.** MM‑CHR *imports* the canonical Characteristic vocabulary and the CSLC discipline fixed by A.17 and A.18; it does not redefine them. CharacteristicSpace reasoning (for change) lives in the architheories that consume MM‑CHR readings.

**Using architheories.** KD‑CAL, Arch‑CAL and others *instantiate* templates and produce measures; MM‑CHR remains a neutral measurement substrate. Trade‑off analyses and architectural trajectories operate over coordinates that MM‑CHR makes available, not inside MM‑CHR.

**Unification (F‑cluster).** External standards (e.g., ISO 80000 quantity types; W3C SOSA/SSN observable properties; QUDT units/quantity kinds) are related via Concept‑Set rows and Bridges; MM‑CHR treats those alignments as context supplied by F‑patterns, not as local re‑definitions.

## C.17 — **Creativity‑CHR** — Characterising Generative Novelty & Value 

### 0 · Status, Placement & Exports

**Status.** Architheory specification (**CHR**) — normative where stated.
**Depends on.** A‑kernel (A.1–A.15), **CHR‑CAL** (C.7), **MM‑CHR** measurement infrastructure (C.16), **KD‑CAL** and **Sys‑CAL** for carriers and holons, **Decsn‑CAL** (utility), **Norm‑CAL** (constraints/ethics).
**Coordinates with.** **B.5.2.1 NQD** (abductive generator) for search instrumentation, **Agency-CHR** (C.9) for agential capacity, B-cluster trust/assurance (B.3), Canonical Evolution Loop (B.4), Role Assignment & Enactment Cycle (Six-Step) (F.6) and Naming Discipline for U.Types & Role Names (F.5).
**Guard‑rails.** Obeys E‑cluster authoring rules (Notational Independence; DevOps Lexical Firewall; Unidirectional Dependency).

**What this architheory provides (exports):**

This architheory exports **Characteristics** and measurement templates **only**. It **does not** export any Γ\_\* operators, portfolio composition rules, or selection/scalarization policies; those live in **C.18 NQD-CAL** and **C.19 E/E-LOG** (or **Decsn-CAL** for decision lenses). A Context _publishes_ the measurement space and admissible policies; a decision is taken by an _agent in role_ using a _named lens_ within that space.

* **`U.CreativitySpace`** — a **CharacteristicSpace** (CHR) with named **Characteristics** and scale metadata for evaluating creative work/outcomes **inside a `U.BoundedContext`**.
* **`U.CreativityProfile`** — a vector of coordinates in `U.CreativitySpace` attached by a **`U.Evaluation`** to a specific **Outcome** (usually an `U.Episteme` produced by `U.Work`).
* **Core Characteristics (kernel nucleus; Context‑extensible):**
1. **`Novelty@context`** — distance from a **`ReferenceBase`** in the current Context/time window; ∈ \[0, 1].
2. **`Use‑Value`** *(alias: `ValueGain`)* — measured or predicted improvement against a **declared objective**; interval/ratio scale per Context.
3. **`Surprise`** — negative log‑likelihood under a **GenerativePrior**; bits or nats.
4. **`ConstraintFit`** — degree of **must‑constraint** satisfaction (Norm‑CAL / Service acceptance); ∈ \[0, 1].
5. **Diversity_P (portfolio-level)** — coverage/dispersion (set-level). **Illumination** is a **gauge over Diversity_P** (coverage/QD-score summaries). It is **report-only** and **never** part of the primary dominance test.
6. **`AttributionIntegrity`** — provenance/licensing discipline for lawful, transparent recombination; ∈ \[0, 1].

* **Supporting types (linking points):**

  * **`U.ReferenceBase`** — the domain‑local corpus (by Context & time window) used to compute `Novelty@context`.
  * **`U.SimilarityKernel`** — a declared similarity metric class for the Context (text/image/design/code/etc.), with invariance notes.
  * **`U.GenerativePrior`** — a predictive model over the Context’s artifacts/behaviours used to compute `Surprise`.
  * **`U.CreativeEvaluation`** — a specialisation of `U.Evaluation` that yields a `U.CreativityProfile` and the evidence anchors.
  * **`EffortCost`** *(advisory)* — resource outlay to achieve the outcome; from WorkLedger (Resrc‑CAL). *(For normalization and planning; not itself “creativity.”)*


* **Operators (first tranche):** `composeProfiles` (set → portfolio), `dominates` (partial order in space), `frontier` (Pareto set), `normaliseByEffort`. *(Formal laws introduced in Quarter 2.)*
* **Relations (informative; not exported):** dominance relation (partial order in the space), frontier predicate (Pareto set), portfolio composition view. *C.17 exports no operators; these are mathematical relations only.*
* 
> **Scope note.** This architheory **does not** define who is “a creative person.” It characterises **creative outcomes and episodes** as **observed in Work** and **expressed as Epistemes**. Agency (capacity to originate) is measured in **Agency‑CHR (C.9)**; here we measure **what came out** and **how it scores** against stated goals and references.  A **Context publishes** the measurement space and admissible policies; a **decision is made by an agentic system in role**, using a named lens within that space. CHR exports **no Γ‑operators** and **no team workflow rules**.

### 1 · Motivation & Intent (manager’s read‑first)

**Problem we solve.** Teams talk past each other about “creativity”: some prize **novelty**, others **business value**, others **originality** or **risk‑managed invention**. Without a shared, context‑local measurement space, reviews derail, portfolios drift, and safety constraints are waived ad‑hoc.

**Intent.** Provide a **small, universal measurement kit** that turns “this is creative” into **checkable, context‑local statements** — grounded in **evidence**, aligned to **objectives**, and **composable** from individuals to portfolios.

**Manager’s one‑screen summary (what you can do with it):**

1. **Score** a design/code/theory change on **Novelty–Value–Surprise–ConstraintFit** with declared references and models.
2. **Compare** options in a **Pareto sense** (no single magic score forced).
3. **Consider** constraints as a **coordinate** in the space; compare options on **frontiers** while keeping Context for high‑novelty options
4. **Track** a portfolio’s **Diversity** to avoid local maxima and groupthink.
5. **Defend** decisions with an auditable **CreativeEvaluation** that cites **what was new relative to which base**, **how value was measured**, and **why this counts here**.

### 2 · Forces

| Force                                | Tension we must resolve                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs. domain detail**   | One kit must serve hardware design, software, policy, and science, yet let each Context pick similarity kernels, priors, and value models. |
| **Invention vs. constraint**         | Creative leaps are valuable; safety, ethics, and acceptance are non‑negotiable.                                                         |
| **Local truth vs. Cross‑context reuse** | Meaning is context‑local (A.1.1); yet we need Bridges to compare across organisations/disciplines.                                         |
| **Single score vs. frontier**        | Management wants a number; reality is multi‑objective.                                                                                  |
| **Randomness vs. intention**         | Random noise looks “novel” yet useless; planned recombination can be highly creative.                                                   |

**Design answer.** A **context‑local CreativitySpace** with a **small set of characteristics**, each with **clear measurement templates** and **evidence anchors**; composition uses **frontiers and partial orders**, not forced scalarisation.

---

### 3 · Solution Overview — The context‑local CreativitySpace

**Idea.** Creativity is **not a type**; it is a **profile** measured on an **outcome** (episteme) or **episode** (set of works) **inside a bounded context**. The context supplies the **ReferenceBase**, **SimilarityKernel**, **GenerativePrior**, **objective function(s)**, and **acceptance constraints**.

**Objects in play (A‑kernel alignment):**

* A **system** (person, team, service) performs **`U.Work`** under a role (A.2).
* That work yields a **carrier** (doc/model/design/code), i.e., an **`U.Episteme`**.
* We apply a **`U.CreativeEvaluation`** to that episteme (and linked work) to produce a **`U.CreativityProfile`** with evidence.

**Cre­ativitySpace (first‑class CHR):**
`U.CreativitySpace(Context) := 〈Novelty@context, ValueGain, Surprise, ConstraintFit, Diversity_P, AttributionIntegrity, EffortCost?〉`
with **scale**/**unit** metadata from **MM‑CHR** (C.16), and Context‑specific **measurement methods** bound by **MethodDescription**.

**Design/run split (A.4):**

* **Design‑time**: score **concepts** or **specs** against **surrogate value models** and **priors**; record **assumptions** (USM scopes; A.2.6).
* **Run‑time**: recompute **ValueGain** and **ConstraintFit** from Work evidence (service acceptance, KPIs) and refresh **Surprise** if priors update.

### 4 · Vocabulary (CHR terms & D‑stubs)

> Names are **context‑local**; below are kernel terms. Roles like “Designer/Reviewer” are contextual (A.2). **Documents don’t act** (A.7/A.12); they are **evaluated**.

1. **`U.ReferenceBase`** *(D).* A curated, versioned **set of artifacts** (epistemes) and/or behaviours that define “what exists already” **in this Context and time window**.
   **Conformance (RB‑1):** must declare **inclusion criteria**, **time span (`TimeWindow`)**, and **coverage notes**.

2. **`U.SimilarityKernel`** *(D).* A declared **metric family** with invariances (e.g., text: cosine over embeddings, image: LPIPS, code: AST graph edit).
   **Conformance (SK‑1):** must cite **MethodDescription** and **test corpus**; state **limits**.

3. **`U.GenerativePrior`** *(D).* A model that yields **likelihood** of artifacts given the Context’s history (n‑gram/LM, design grammar, trend model).
   **Conformance (GP‑1):** must publish **training slice**, **fit method**, **perplexity/fit metrics**, and **refresh policy**.

4. **`U.CreativeOutcome`** *(D).* Any **`U.Episteme`** put forward for creative evaluation (e.g., new design, algorithm, spec, policy draft).
   **Note.** If the outcome is a **system change** without a single carrier, attach the evaluation to a **bundle** (set) of carriers referenced from Work.

5. **`U.CreativeEvaluation`** *(D).* A **`U.Evaluation`** that outputs a **`U.CreativityProfile`** and anchors to **ReferenceBase**, **Kernel/Prior**, **objective(s)**, **acceptance tests**, and **Work evidence**.

6. **`U.CreativityProfile`** *(D).* The **coordinate tuple** in `U.CreativitySpace` with provenance to the above inputs and **USM scopes**.
   **Conformance (CP‑1):** profile **must** include **scales/units**, **scopes**, **confidence bands** (B.3), and the **edition** of space definitions.

---

### 5 · The Core Characteristics (kernel nucleus)

Each characteristic is specified per **MM‑CHR (C.16)** with: **name**, **intent**, **carrier**, **polarity**, **scale type**, **measurement template**, **evidence**, **scope (USM)**, and **didactic cues**. *Context profiles MAY add characteristics; kernel characteristics MAY NOT be removed without a Bridge.*

#### 5.1 · `Novelty@context` — “How unlike the known set is this?”

* **Intent.** Quantify **distinctness** of the outcome relative to **`U.ReferenceBase`** (global or targeted slice).
* **Carrier.** `U.Episteme` (the outcome).
* **Polarity.** Higher is “more novel.”
* **Scale.** **\[0, 1]**; ratio (0 = duplicate under kernel; 1 = maximally distant).
* **Measurement template (normative pattern):**

  1. Declare **ReferenceBase** `B` and **TimeWindow** window.
  2. Declare **SimilarityKernel** `σ` and its invariances.
  3. Compute **`Novelty@context := 1 − max_{b∈B} sim_σ(outcome, b)`**, or a robust variant (top‑k mean).
  4. Publish **sensitivity note** (how results shift with kernel/`B`).
* **Evidence.** Kernel/version id; top‑k neighbours with distances; ablation on invariances.
* **Scope hooks (USM).** `B` **must** be a declared **slice**; Cross‑context use needs a **Bridge** with **CL** and **loss notes**.
* **Didactic cues.**

  * **Not** “randomness.” Noise has high novelty, low value.
  * **Local, not global.** Novelty is **to this Context now**, not timeless originality.

#### 5.2 · `Use‑Value` *(alias: `ValueGain`)* — “What good did this add under our objective?”

* **Intent.** Quantify **benefit** vs a baseline objective (Decsn‑CAL utility, Service acceptance, KPI).
* **Carrier.** Outcome (episteme) with **Work** evidence.
* **Polarity.** Higher is better.
* **Scale.** Interval/ratio, unit **declared by the Context** (e.g., ΔSNR, % defects, profit/period).
* **Measurement templates (pick one):**

  * **Measured:** `ValueGain := metric_after − metric_before` (declare counterfactual method).
  * **Predicted:** `E[ValueGain | model]` with error bars; update post‑run.
  * **Evidence.**  Declared **objective/criterion**; measurements or credible predictions; counterfactual method (A/B, back‑test, causal inference).
  * **Scope.** State the **context window** used for the objective; claims outside that window are **informative only**.
  * **Didactic cues.**

  * Value is **relative to stated objective**; if the objective is wrong, the value reflects it.
  * Keep **counterfactual discipline**; otherwise “gain” is storytelling.

#### 5.3 · `Surprise` — “How improbable under our learned world?”

* **Intent.** Capture **unexpectedness** given **`U.GenerativePrior`**.
* **Carrier.** Outcome.
* **Polarity.** Higher surprise = more unexpected.
* **Scale.** **bits** or **nats**: `Surprise := −log p_prior(outcome)`.
* **Measurement template:**

  1. Declare **GenerativePrior** (training slice, model class).
  2. Encode outcome for the prior; compute likelihood proxy.
  3. Publish calibration curve (reliability diagram / PIT histogram).
* **Evidence.** Model cards; fit metrics; OOD diagnostics; refresh policy.
* **Scope.** Training slice declared as **ContextSlice**; Bridges penalise **R** (trust), not the value itself (A.2.6).
* **Didactic cues.**

  * **Novelty vs Surprise:** high novelty under one kernel may be low surprise under a broad prior; publish both.

#### 5.4 · `ConstraintFit` — “Did it honour the non‑negotiables?”

* **Intent.** Ensure **mandatory constraints** (safety, ethics, standards, SLOs) are satisfied.
* **Carrier.** Outcome + Work evidence.
* **Polarity.** Higher is **better** (1 = all mandatory satisfied).
* **Scale.** **\[0, 1]**, ratio or pass/fail.
* **Measurement template:** declare **set `C_must`** (Norm‑CAL / Service acceptance), compute **`ConstraintFit := |{c∈C_must : pass(c)}| / |C_must|`**; optionally weight per criticality.
* **Evidence.** Checklists, tests, audits; Who/Role performed the **SpeechActs** (approvals/waivers).
* **Scope.** Constraints are **context‑local**; Cross‑context requires **Bridge**; waivers are **SpeechAct Work** with RSG gates (A.2.5).
* **Interpretation note.** Low `ConstraintFit` signals tension with declared **must‑constraints** and warrants reframing or redesign; **this pattern does not prescribe go/no‑go rules**.

#### 5.5 · `Diversity_P` *(portfolio‑level)* — “Are we exploring the space?”

* **Intent.** At the **set** level, avoid myopic exploitation; promote **coverage**.
* **Carrier.** A **set** of outcomes.
* **Polarity.** Higher means **broader coverage** (not “better” per se).
* **Scale.** Set‑functional; Context defines metric (e.g., **average pairwise distance**, **k‑cover** over features).
* **Template.** Declare **kernel** and **covering policy**; compute score and **coverage map (illumination)**; relate to **USM ClaimScopes**.
* **Alignment note.** The **illumination/coverage** view corresponds to *IlluminationScore* used by **B.5.2.1 NQD‑Generate**; no separate characteristic is introduced here—measure it as part of `Diversity_P`.
* **Evidence.** Distance matrix/cover plots; sensitivity to kernel.
* **Didactic cue.** Use **Diversity\_P** to **shape portfolios**, not to pick single winners.
* **Marginal gain (for generators)** — normative. For a candidate h and current set S, ΔDiversity_P(h | S) := Diversity_P(S ∪ {h}) − Diversity_P(S). Contexts using NQD SHALL compute D as this marginal and publish the Diversity_P definition alongside the DescriptorSpace/kernel and TimeWindow.

#### 5.6 · `AttributionIntegrity` — “Did we credit sources and licences correctly?”

* **Intent.** Discourage “novelty theft”; ensure **recombination** is **lawful and transparent**.
* **Carrier.** Outcome + provenance graph.
* **Polarity.** Higher is better.
* **Scale.** **\[0, 1]**; fraction of **required attributions/licence duties** satisfied.
* **Template.** Trace graph coverage against Context policy; licence constraints as **Norm‑CAL** rules.
* **Evidence.** PROV‑style links; licence scans; acknowledgements.
* **Didactic cue.** High `AttributionIntegrity` signals lawful and transparent recombination; low values indicate unacceptable practice in most Contexts.  
* **Default role.** `AttributionIntegrity` is **measurable but non‑dominant**. It MAY serve as a **policy filter/tie‑break** (C.19). If certain attribution duties are **must‑constraints**, they belong to **ConstraintFit** (Norm‑CAL) and act as **eligibility gates**. It is **not** part of the default dominance set.
* **Dominance & gating note (normative).** `AttributionIntegrity` is a measurable **Characteristic**; it is **not** in the default dominance set. Contexts MAY use it as a **filter** or **tie‑break** via policy (C.19). Legal/ethical **must‑fit** checks live in **ConstraintFit** (Norm‑CAL); failing those blocks eligibility **before** dominance.

#### 5.7 · `EffortCost` *(advisory)* — “What did it take?”

* **Intent.** Normalise comparisons by cost; not part of “creativity” per se.
* **Carrier.** WorkLedger.
* **Polarity.** Lower is better when used as denominator.
* **Scale.** Resource units (hours, energy, \$).
* **Template.** Sum cost categories over Work that produced the outcome.
* **Evidence.** Time/resource logs; BOM deltas.
* **Didactic cue.** Use **`CreativityPerCost := f(Novelty@context, ValueGain, Surprise)/EffortCost`** for operations planning, not for excellence awards.

### 6 · Conformance Checklist (first tranche)

| ID                                        | Requirement (normative)                                                                                                                                                                  | Purpose / audit hint                                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑CR‑1 (context‑locality)**               | Every **CreativityProfile** **MUST** name the **`U.BoundedContext`** and the **edition** of `U.CreativitySpace`.                                                                         | Prevents Cross‑context slippage.                                 |
| **CC‑CR‑2 (Declared bases)**              | **Novelty@context** claims **MUST** declare `ReferenceBase`, `SimilarityKernel`, and `TimeWindow`; **Surprise** claims **MUST** declare `GenerativePrior` and its training slice.                 | Makes “new to whom?” and “unexpected under what?” explicit.   |
| **CC‑CR‑3 (Objective anchor)**            | **ValueGain** **MUST** reference the **objective** (KPI/utility) and **counterfactual method** (if predicted, the model).                                                                | Stops free‑form value stories.                                |
| **CC‑CR‑4 (Must‑fit)**                    | If **must** constraints exist, **ConstraintFit** **MUST** be present; enactment decisions **SHALL** treat `ConstraintFit<1` as **fail**, unless an explicit **waiver SpeechAct** exists. | Keeps safety & ethics non‑negotiable.                         |
| **CC‑CR‑5 (Evidence)**                    | Each coordinate **MUST** have evidence anchors (neighbours, tests, logs, model cards).                                                                                                   | Enables audit & replication.                                  |
| **CC‑CR‑6 (Scopes)**                      | Profiles **MUST** include **USM scopes** (ClaimScope/WorkScope) relevant to measurement; off‑scope claims are advisory.                                                                  | Ties numbers to where they hold.                              |
| **CC‑CR‑7 (No scalarisation by default)** | The architheory **SHALL NOT** force a single scalar “creativity score.” If a Context defines one, it **MUST** publish the weighting and its drift policy.                                   | Keeps decisions on a Pareto frontier unless a policy opts‑in. |
| **CC‑CR‑8 (Bridge discipline)**           | Cross‑context comparisons **MUST** use a **Bridge** with **CL** and recorded **losses**; any mapped coordinate **MUST** note penalties in the **R** lane, not silently alter the value.     | Honest portability.                                           |

### 7 · Manager’s Quick‑Start (apply in 5 steps)

1. **Name the Context** *(context + edition)*.
2. **Pick measurement defaults** *(kernel, prior, objective, constraints)* from the Context’s handbook.
3. **Score outcome** → `Novelty@context`, `Use‑Value`, `Surprise`, `ConstraintFit`.
4. **Decide by frontier**: shortlist **non‑dominated** options; use **ConstraintFit** as a gate; apply **policy** if a scalar is approved.
5. **Record a CreativeEvaluation** with evidence; if crossing Contexts, attach the **Bridge id**.

> **Mental check.** *New to our base? Helpful to our objective? Unexpected under our model? Safe & licenced?*
> If any answer is “unknown,” you are **not done measuring**.

---

### 8 · Archetypal Grounding (three domains)

**(a) Manufacturing design change)**
*Outcome.* New impeller geometry for Pump‑37.
*Context.* `PlantHydraulics_2026`.
*Novelty@context* 0.42 (shape‑descriptor kernel vs last 5 years).
*ValueGain.* +6.8% flow @ same power (bench Work).
*Surprise.* 1.3 bits (within evolutionary trend prior).
*ConstraintFit.* 1.0 (materials, safety, noise).
*Decision.* **Frontier winner**: modest novelty, clear value, safe. Portfolio keeps **Diversity\_P** by also funding one high‑surprise concept for exploration.

**(b) Software architecture refactor)**
*Outcome.* New concurrency model for ETL.
*Context.* `DataPlatform_2026`.
*Novelty\_G.* 0.27 (AST/edit kernel vs internal corpus).
*ValueGain.* −20% latency, −35% p95 stalls (A/B Work).
*Surprise.* 0.5 bits (trend prior expected co‑routines).
*ConstraintFit.* 0.83 (fails SoD—same author as reviewer).
*Decision.* Return for **SoD fix**; then likely adopt. Creativity is **not** a waiver over governance.

**(c) Scientific hypothesis)**
*Outcome.* A new scaling law claim.
*Context.* `GraphDynamics_2026`.
*Novelty\_G.* 0.66 (formula kernel vs literature base).
*ValueGain.* Predicted: explains 12 prior anomalies (model check).
*Surprise.* 3.7 bits (strongly unexpected under prior).
*ConstraintFit.* 1.0 (ethics N/A; evidence roles bound with decay windows).
*Decision.* Fund **replication Work**; track **R** decay per policy.

### 9 · Anti‑Patterns (fast fixes)

| Anti‑pattern                   | Why it fails                                                                  | Fix with this architheory                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **“Creativity = randomness.”** | Noise yields high `Novelty@context`, low `ValueGain` and often low `ConstraintFit`. | Evaluate **all four** characteristics; require ConstraintFit=1 for musts.                   |
| **Global originality claims.** | Ignores context‑local meaning and current corpus.                                | Declare **Context & ReferenceBase**; cross Contexts only via **Bridge**.               |
| **One magic score.**           | Hides trade‑offs; fragile under drift.                                        | Decide on **Pareto frontier**; publish scalar only with explicit weights/policy. |
| **Hand‑wavy value.**           | No objective → no audit.                                                      | Tie to **Service/KPI** or **utility**; state **counterfactual**.                 |
| **Silent borrowing.**          | Legal/ethical risk; reputational damage.                                      | Track **AttributionIntegrity**; licence scans in evidence.                       |

---

### 10 · Relations (where this plugs in)

* **A.2 Role & A.15 Run‑alignment.** Creative **Work** is performed by **systems in roles**; outcomes are **epistemes**. Creativity is **measured by `U.Evaluation`**, not “done by a document.”
* **B.3 Trust/Assurance.** Coordinates carry **confidence bands**; Bridges lower **R** by **CL**. Evidence roles (A.2.4) bind datasets/benchmarks used in measurements.
* **C.9 Agency‑CHR.** Agency measures **capacity to originate**; a high‑agency system may still output low‑creativity outcomes (and vice versa with strong scaffolding).
* **A.2.6 USM (Scope).** All measurements sit on **ContextSlices**; `G‑ladder` is explicitly **not** used (C.17 follows A.2.6’s set‑valued scopes).
* **D‑cluster ethics.** **ConstraintFit** is where **must** constraints, ethics, and safety bind the evaluation; waivers are explicit **SpeechActs**.

---

### 11 · Authoring Aids (didactic cards)

* **Write the Context.** Context + edition on every profile.
* **Name the base & kernel.** Without them, `Novelty@context` is undefined.
* **State the objective.** Value without a KPI is a story.
* **Publish priors.** Surprise needs a trained model with cards.
* **Gate by musts.** `ConstraintFit` < 1 blocks enactment unless waived.
* **Prefer frontiers.** Shortlist non‑dominated options; let governance decide trade‑offs.
* **Bridge explicitly.** Cross‑context talk needs CL and loss notes.

## 12 · CSLC recap and the Creativity CharacteristicSpace

**Purpose.** Ground “creativity” as a **measurable family of characteristics** (CHR) rather than a role, capability, or virtue. Each characteristic is scoped to a **`U.BoundedContext`**, evaluated on **`U.Work`** (episodes), **artifacts** (epistemes, e.g., design sketches, models), or **holders** (systems/teams) via **MM‑CHR** exports (`U.MetricTemplate`, `U.Measure`, `U.Unit`, `U.EvidenceStub`), using the **CSLC** discipline (*Characteristic / Scale / Level / Coordinate*).

> **Strict Distinction (A.7) reminders.**
> *Creativity is not a Role* (no one “plays CreativityRole”). It’s a **characterisation** of outcomes/process.
> *Creativity is not Work* (no resource deltas). Work **produces** artifacts we later characterise.
> *Creativity is not a Service* (no external promise). Services are judged from Work; creativity may correlate with value.

### 12.1 · The Creativity CharacteristicSpace (CHR‑SPACE)

The core **characteristics** below are **kernel‑portable** names; Contexts **specialise** them (rename if needed, but keep semantics). Each characteristic declares: **what we measure**, **on what carrier**, **typical scale**, and **where it lives** in FPF.

| Characteristics (kernel name)       | What it captures (intuitive)                                 | Measured on           | Typical scale (CSLC)                               | Lives with / checked by              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Novelty\@context**        | Distance from known ideas **in this Context**                   | Artifact / Work set   | Ratio or bounded \[0..1] via *similarity→distance* | `KD‑CAL` corpus + `U.BoundedContext` |
| **Use‑Value**            | Benefit vs a **declared objective**                          | Artifact / Evaluation | Ordinal (Fail/Partial/Pass) or scalar KPI          | `B.3` Evidence & `U.Evaluation`      |
| **Surprise**             | Unexpectedness under the Context’s **GenerativePrior**          | Artifact              | bits or nats (−log‑likelihood)                     | Prior cards & calibration            |
| **ConstraintFit**        | Degree of **must‑constraints** satisfied while exploring     | Work / Artifact       | % satisfied (0–100)                                | `Norm‑CAL` + step guards             |
| **Diversity_P**          | Portfolio **coverage/dispersion** (incl. coverage map view)  | Set of artifacts      | Set‑functional; coverage index                     | `Γ_ctx` fold + USM ClaimScopes       |
| **AttributionIntegrity** | Lawful & transparent **provenance/licensing**                | Artifact + provenance | \[0,1]                                              | PROV + Norm‑CAL                      |

> **Locality.** **Every characteristic is context‑local** (e.g., **Novelty\@context**). Cross‑context claims **must** use a **Bridge** and record **CL** penalties (B.3). No global novelty.

#### 12.2 · Context extensions & policy‑level characteristics (non‑kernel)

The following **context‑local** characteristics remain available but are **not** part of the kernel nucleus; use them as **derived** or **policy** measures:

* **ReframeDelta** — change in the **problem frame** that improves solvability (episteme‑pair; ordinal).
* **Compositionality** — degree of **re‑use and new relations** among parts (artifact; boolean + structure score).
* **Transferability\@X** — portability to **Context X** via a Bridge (artifact; ordinal + CL penalty).
* **DiversityOfSearch** — breadth of **approach classes tried** (work set; count/rate).
* **Time‑to‑First‑Viable** — elapsed time to first **Use‑Value = Pass** (work; duration).
* **Risk‑BudgetedExperimentation** — planned vs realized exploration share (workplan vs work; ratio; policy gate).

> **Compatibility note.** This split removes duplicate “core lists” and aligns C.17 with **B.5.2.1 NQD** and **C.16/A.17–A.18**: the **kernel nucleus** captures creativity *qualities*; the items above instrument **process/policy** or **portfolio shaping**.

### 12.3 · Scale choices (CSLC discipline)

For each characteristic, **declare the scale** explicitly (nominal / ordinal / interval / ratio). **Do not** average ordinal scores; fold with medians or distributional summaries. Choose **units** (when applicable) and **coordinate** semantics (e.g., what “distance” means).

* *Novelty\@context.*
  Coordinate = `1 − max_similarity(candidate, corpus)` with a declared encoder (text, graph, CAD). Unitless in \[0..1]. Document encoder & corpus freeze (`A.10` evidence anchors).
* *Use‑Value.*
  `Pass` iff **acceptanceSpec** (from `U.Service` or Decision KPI) is met from **Work** evidence; else `Partial`/`Fail`. For scalar KPIs, publish mean ± CI and the acceptance threshold; predicted values carry error bars and are updated post‑run.
* *ConstraintFit.*
  Ratio = satisfied / declared **must** constraints. Constraints are `Norm‑CAL` rules; **count only declared** ones (no unspoken “norms”).


## 12.4 · Metric templates (normative kernels + manager‑ready variants)

> **Template syntax (MM‑CHR):**
> `U.MetricTemplate { name, context, carrierKind, definition, unit?, scale, evidenceHook, acceptanceHook? }`

### 12.4.1 · Templates (kernel definitions)

1. **`MT.Novelty@context`**

* **carrierKind:** Artifact|WorkOutput.
* **definition:** `1 − max_sim(encode(x), encode(y))` over y in **ReferenceSet**@Context.
* **scale:** ratio \[0..1].
* **evidenceHook:** `{ReferenceSetId, EncoderId, Version}`; frozen by `A.10`.
* **notes:** Publish encoder & corpus drift in RSCR.

2. **`MT.Use‑Value`**

* **carrierKind:** Work (fulfillment) → artifact (decision memo).
* **definition:** Evaluation of an outcome against a declared **objective/criterion** for the current context (or predicted value with explicit model & error).
* **scale:** ordinal {Fail, Partial, Pass} or scalar KPI.
* **evidenceHook:** links to `U.Work` that **fulfilsService\`**; cite acceptanceSpec edition.

3. **`MT.ConstraintFit`**

* **carrierKind:** Work / Artifact.
* **definition:** `|{c∈C_must : pass(c)}| / |C_must|` within the **MethodDescription** scope; optional weighting by criticality allowed if declared.
* **scale:** ratio \[0..1].
* **evidenceHook:** constraint list from **Norm‑CAL**; checks from Work telemetry.

4. **`MT.ReframeDelta`**

* **carrierKind:** Episteme pair (ProblemStatement v0→v1).
* **definition:** Categorise frame change as {None, Local, BoundaryShift, Systemic}; **justify** with a Scope diff (`A.2.6 U.ContextSlice` delta) and causal map simplification.
* **scale:** ordinal 0–3.
* **evidenceHook:** diff artifact + Bridge notes if Cross‑context.

5. **`MT.DiversityOfSearch`**

* **carrierKind:** Work set (episode).
* **definition:** Count of **distinct approach classes** tried (domain‑local typology) / time.
* **scale:** count; derived rate.
* **evidenceHook:** tagged Work items; typology lives in the Context glossary.

6. **`MT.Compositionality`**

* **carrierKind:** Artifact.
* **definition:** set aggregator (Compose‑CAL) of reused components ≥ K and presence of novel relation among ≥ 2 parts.
* **scale:** boolean + secondary “structure score” (e.g., depth or edge novelty).
* **evidenceHook:** component graph + provenance of parts.

7. **`MT.Transferability@X`**

* **carrierKind:** Artifact.
* **definition:** Applicability in target **Context X** via a **Bridge**; report **CL** and residual scope slice.
* **scale:** ordinal {not portable, portable with loss, near‑iso}; record CL (0–3).
* **evidenceHook:** Bridge id + pilot Work in X.

8. **`MT.Time‑to‑First‑Viable`**

* **carrierKind:** Work episode.
* **definition:** elapsed wall‑clock to first `UsefulnessEvidence = Pass`.
* **scale:** duration.
* **evidenceHook:** first passing `U.Work` id.

9. **`MT.Risk‑BudgetedExperimentation`**

* **carrierKind:** WorkPlan vs Work.
* **definition:** `(Planned exploratory spend) / (Allowed risk budget)` and realised counterpart; flag **overrun**.
* **scale:** ratio + policy gate (pass/fail).
* **evidenceHook:** WorkPlan ledger vs `WorkLedger`.

### 12.4.2 · Manager’s quick checks (plain‑language adapters)

* **Novelty** without a **frozen corpus** is **storytelling**—freeze corpus, fix encoder, then score.
* **Use‑Value** without a **consumer‑facing acceptance** is a **proxy**—bind to a **Service** or explicit Objective.
* **Diversity** counts **approach classes**, not color‑swap variants—publish your typology.

## 13 · Novelty & transfer are **context‑local** (Bridges mandatory)

**Rule N‑1 (Locality).** `Novelty@context` is defined **only** within its `U.BoundedContext`. **Never** compare scores across Contexts without an **Alignment Bridge** (F.9).

**Rule N‑2 (Directional mapping).** A Bridge may assert a **directional** substitution (e.g., *Novelty\@DesignLab → Novelty\@Manufacturing* with CL = 2, **loss:** aesthetics encoder absent). Reverse mapping is **not** implied.

**Rule N‑3 (Penalty to R, not to G).** Cross‑context novelty **does not** change scope **G**; it **reduces R** (reliability) by the **CL penalty** (B.3), unless validated by pilot Work in the target Context.

**Practical pattern.** Publish novelty **with its Context tag** and—when reused—attach the **Bridge id** and target‑context **pilot** outcomes.

---

## 14 · Anti‑Goodhart guard (use creativity metrics safely)

> **Goodhart’s Law:** “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” — We bake in **guards** so creativity scoring **improves** outcomes instead of gaming them.

### 14.1 · Guard‑rails (normative)

* **G‑1 Paired appraisal.** **Never** assess **Novelty** in isolation; pair it with **Use‑Value** or **ConstraintFit** to avoid proxy myopia
* **G‑2 Frozen references.** Novelty requires **frozen corpus + encoder**; changes create a **new edition** and **RSCR** rerun. Portfolio/selection heuristics are **policy-level** (see **C.19**); do not “reward” Illumination beyond its role as a report-gauge.
* **G‑3 Time‑lag sanity.** Include a **post‑fact check** (e.g., 30–90‑day retention or cost‑to‑serve delta) before celebrating “creative wins.”
* **G‑4 Exploration budget.** Tie **DiversityOfSearch** to **Risk‑BudgetedExperimentation**; flag overspend.
* **G‑5 No ordinal averaging.** Do not average **ordinal** scales; use distributions/medians or convert only under declared models.

### 14.2 · Conformance Checklist — **CC‑C17‑M (metrics & guards)**

| ID             | Requirement                                                                                                                            | Practical test                                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑C17‑M.1** | Each metric instance **MUST** cite its **Context**, **edition**, and **evidence hooks** (corpus/encoder, acceptanceSpec, constraint set). | Scorecard lists `ContextId`, `Edition`, and hook ids resolvable via `A.10`. |
| **CC‑C17‑M.2** | **Novelty** scores **MUST NOT** be used to approve Work without a **paired gate** (**Use‑Value** **or** **ConstraintFit**).               | Find decisions referencing novelty; check co‑gate present.                  |
| **CC‑C17‑M.3** | Cross‑context reuse **MUST** cite a **Bridge** and record **CL**; **R** is penalised accordingly.                                         | Scorecards with foreign Context tag lacking Bridge → **fail**.                 |
| **CC‑C17‑M.4** | Ordinal metrics **MUST** be summarised with medians/distributions, not means, unless a declared model justifies numeric treatment.     | Reports using a mean on ordinal without model → **fail**.                   |
| **CC‑C17‑M.5** | Metric templates **MUST** be versioned; changing encoder, reference set, or acceptanceSpec **creates a new edition**.                  | Diff shows changed hooks without edition bump → **fail**.                   |

## 15 · Worked mini‑cases (engineer‑manager focus)

> **All names are context‑local; bridges and editions are explicit.**
> We show **(a)** what is measured, **(b)** who acts, **(c)** what is accepted, and **(d)** how evidence flows.

### Case A — Hardware ideation sprint (manufacturing design)

* **Context.** `DesignLab_2026`.
* **Objective.** Reduce fastener count by ≥ 30 % without tooling changes.
* **MethodDescription.** “Morphological matrix ideation v2.”
* **Work.** 1‑day sprint, 6 sessions.
* **Metrics.** `Novelty@context` (encoder: CAD‑graph v1; ReferenceSet: in‑house assemblies), `ConstraintFit` (no‑tooling‑change), `Use‑Value` (acceptance: Pass if sim shows ≤ +5 % assembly time).
* **Roles.** Performers = design cell (#TransformerRole); Observer = methods coach (#ObserverRole ⊥).
* **Outcome.** 22 candidates; 4 **Pass** usefulness; best `Novelty`=0.41 with **100 %** constraints respected; `Time‑to‑First‑Viable` = 3 h 40 m.
* **Evidence.** Scorecard episteme holds metrics; links to Work ids; acceptance tied to internal **Service** “Design‑for‑Assembly Simulation”.

**Manager’s read.** “We didn’t just produce ‘novel’ shapes; 4 passed the sim and respected constraints, within the day.”

---

### Case B — Data‑science hypothesis generation (health analytics)

* **Context.** `Cardio_2026`.
* **Objective.** Find a new risk factor candidate for readmission (< 30 days).
* **MethodDescription.** “Causal discovery v3 + clinician review.”
* **Metrics.** `DiversityOfSearch` (approach classes: feature ablation, IVs, DAG‑learners), `Novelty@context` (text encoder over prior hypotheses), `Use‑Value` (AUROC uplift ≥ 0.03 on hold‑out), `Transferability@Hospital_B` (Bridge CL=2).
* **Roles.** SRE pipeline (#ObserverRole) computes metrics; clinicians (#ReviewerRole) set acceptance; data squad (#TransformerRole) performs experiments.
* **Outcome.** Two candidates; one meets AUROC uplift; **Transferability** requires follow‑up (CL penalty).
* **Evidence.** Episteme bundle: model cards, hold‑out plots, Bridge note.

**Manager’s read.** “One candidate works **here**; plan a pilot at Hospital B (we recorded CL=2).”

---

### Case C — Product squad reframing (software UX)

* **Context.** `SaaS_Onboarding_2026`.
* **Objective.** Reduce time‑to‑value (TTV) by 20 %.
* **MethodDescription.** “JTBD interviews + onboarding flow experiments.”
* **Metrics.** `ReframeDelta` (BoundaryShift: split onboarding into ‘job setup’ and ‘first result’), `Use‑Value` (TTV ‑22 % on A/B), `Risk‑BudgetedExperimentation` (within cap), `Compositionality` (reuse of existing workflow widgets).
* **Roles.** UX researcher (#ObserverRole), squad (#TransformerRole), product ops (#ReviewerRole).
* **Outcome.** Frame changed; TTV target passed; experiments within budget.
* **Evidence.** Reframing episteme with Scope diff + A/B report.

**Manager’s read.** “We changed the problem frame and proved the value drop—within risk limits.”

### What these cases illustrate (tie‑backs)

* **Locality.** All novelty/usefulness claims are **Context‑tagged**; Cross‑context steps use **Bridges** with **CL**.
* **Dual‑gate.** Novelty never acts alone; usefulness/constraints co‑gate decisions.
* **SoD & Evidence.** Observers are **separate** from performers; metrics live on **epistemes** with **frozen hooks**; Work proves fulfillment.


## 16. Working examples

#### 16.1 · Software (algorithmic/architectural ideation)

**Kernel characteristics (↑/↓/gate).**
Novelty↑ (algorithmic / compositional), Use‑Value↑ (targeted user/job metric), ConstraintFit=gate (resource/latency envelope), Cost‑to‑Probe↓ (hours to runnable spike), Evidence‑Level↑ (tests/benchmarks confidence), Option‑Value↑ (paths unlocked), RegretRisk↓ (blast radius if wrong).

**Priors.**

* Novelty prior **skeptical** beyond nearest known family (discount by conceptual distance).
* Evidence prior at **L0** (B.3) until benchmarks exist; regression tests act as **ObserverRole** evidence.

**Context card (one screen).**

* Γ\_bundle: Cost = sum; ConstraintFit = AND; Novelty = subadditive; Evidence = min (chain) / SpanUnion (indep).

#### 16.2 · Hardware (mechanical/electro‑mechanical concepting)**

**Kernel characteristics.**
Novelty↑ (principle/material), Use‑Value↑ (performance delta), ConstraintFit=gate (manufacturability window), Time‑to‑Probe↓ (bench jig), Cost‑to‑Probe↓, SafetyRisk↓ (hazard), Evidence‑Level↑ (bench data), Option‑Value↑ (platform reuse).

**Priors.**

* SafetyRisk has **WLNK** priority (R must cover hazard chain).
* ConstraintFit must pass **manufacturing gate** before frontier inclusion.

**Context card.**
* Γ\_bundle: Hazard = max; ConstraintFit = AND; Cost = sum+coupling; Evidence = min on chain; Scope via **WorkScope** (A.2.6).

#### 16.3 · Policy design (rules/standards/programs)

**Kernel characteristics.**
Novelty↑ (institutional), Use‑Value↑ (measurable social/operational effect), ConstraintFit=gate (legal/operational), Cost‑to‑Probe↓ (pilot), Evidence‑Level↑ (triangulated), EthicalRisk↓ (D‑cluster), Option‑Value↑ (coalitions/pathways), Scope (ClaimScope G) explicit.

**Priors.**
* EthicalRisk uses **status‑only** eligibility conditions; Evidence aging (decay) is **fast**; cross‑context Bridges carry **CL** penalties.

**Context card.**
* Γ\_bundle: EthicalRisk = max; ConstraintFit = AND (legal & operational); Cost = sum; Evidence = min/SpanUnion; Scope = ClaimScope (A.2.6).

## 17 Consequences & fit (for engineer‑managers)

* You can **reason on paper** about creativity: compare with **dominance**, pick along a **frontier**, and steer exploration with a few **policy characteristics**.
* Changes to the space (**scales, eligibility conditions, operators**) are handled by **RSCR**, so decisions are **explainable over time**.
* The **Context handbooks** are a **thinking OS**: one screen to start ideating without importing tool stacks or management playbooks.

## 18 Relations

* **Builds on**: B.1 Γ‑algebra (WLNK/COMM/IDEM/MONO), B.3 Trust & Assurance (F–G–R, CL), A.2.6 USM (Claim/Work scopes), A.10 Evidence Anchoring.
* **Coordinates with**: A.2 Role suite (Observer/Evidence roles for probes), A.15 (Work & plans for probes), C.16 MM‑CHR (scale polarity & units). **C.18 NQD-CAL** (generation/illumination operators Γ_nqd.*) and **C.19 E/E-LOG** (policies, selection, and portfolio rules). This CHR remains measurement-only.
* **Defers to**: F.9 Bridges for Cross‑context transfers; D‑cluster for ethical/speech‑act gates.

## 19 Quick reference cards (tear‑out)

* **Dominance test**: apply **signs** + **eligibility conditions** + **trust**; then partial order.
* **Frontier use**: **show frontier** + **name the lens** that picked your choice.
* **Portfolio policy**: keep `ExploreShare` and `WildBetQuota`; set `BackstopConfidence`; rebalance on cadence.

## 20 · Conformance Checklist (pattern‑level, normative)

> *Pass these and your CS modelling remains a thinking architecture, not a team‑management manual.*

**CC‑C17‑1 (context‑local CS).**
Every **CreativitySpace** (the characteristic set where ideation and selection are measured) **MUST** be defined *inside one* `U.BoundedContext`; all characteristics and their scales are local to that Context. (Bridges with CL penalties are required across Contexts; see §C.17.16.)

**CC‑C17‑2 (Characteristics, not “characteristics”).**
Each CS dimension **SHALL** be a named **Characteristic** per **MM‑CHR**, with kind (`qualitative`, `ordinal`, `interval`, `ratio`, or `set‑valued`), unit/scale, polarity, and admissible operations. No free‑floating coordinates. (A.CHR‑NORM / A.CSLC‑Kernel.)

**CC‑C17‑3 (Profile ≠ plan).**
A **Profile** is a *state description over characteristics* (what the option *is* in CS); a **Plan** or **Method** is *how you will act*. Never encode choices or schedules into the profile.

**CC‑C17‑4 (Portfolio = set + rule).**
A **Portfolio** is a set of candidate profiles **plus** a selection rule (objective + constraints) declared *in the same Context*. Presenting only a scatterplot is non‑conformant.

**CC‑C17‑5 (Dominance operator well‑typed).**
A dominance claim **MUST** name the **characteristic subset and polarity** under which it is evaluated. Dominance on incomparable scales (or mixed polarities without explicit transformation) is invalid.

**CC‑C17‑6 (Frontier from rule, not from taste).**
A **Frontier** (Pareto or constraint‑bound) **SHALL** be computed from the declared selection rule; drawing a “nice hull” by eye fails conformance.

**CC‑C17‑7 (Search–Exploit as **dynamics**, not policy dogma).**
Exploration/exploitation **MUST** be expressed as a **dynamics on the portfolio measure(s)** (e.g., exploration share as a function of marginal value of information), *not* as a prescriptive budget recipe. (Design‑time statements belong to Decsn‑CAL; see §C.17.16.)

**CC‑C17‑8 (Evidence anchoring for scores).**
Any numeric score in a profile **MUST** cite its **MeasurementTemplate** (MM‑CHR) and the **observation/evaluation** that yielded it. No anonymous numbers.

**CC‑C17‑9 (Separable uncertainty lanes).**
Keep **aleatory** vs **epistemic** uncertainty separate on characteristics; their combination rule **MUST** be stated (e.g., interval arithmetic, conservative bound).

**CC‑C17‑10 (Time is explicit).**
Comparisons across iterations **MUST** state `TimeWindow` (snapshot window) and whether *drift* or *refit* occurred (§C.17.14). “Latest” is not a time selector.

**CC‑C17‑11 (No proxy collapse).**
If a composite “creativity index” is used, its **aggregation algebra** (weights, monotone transforms) **MUST** be declared; the primitive characteristics remain queryable.

**CC‑C17‑12 (Work stays on Work).**
Resource/time actuals and run logs live on `U.Work`; CS never carries actuals. We reason **about** profiles/portfolios; we do not audit operations here.


### 21 · Worked‑Context Handbooks (concept cards, not runbooks)

> *Each Context publishes one page per card. These are **thinking kernels**: priors, objectives, admissible characteristics, and example transforms. No staffing, no process charts.*

**(a) Kernel Card — “What is a creative win here?”**

* **Context:** `<Context/Edition>`
* **Purpose Characteristic(s):** what “win” means (e.g., *Novelty*, *Usefulness*, *Adoptability*), with polarity and admissible ops.
* **Constraint Characteristics:** *Risk*, *Cost of change*, *Time to learn*, etc.
* **Objective** *(Decsn‑CAL pointer)*: Maximise `<purpose>` subject to declared constraints.
* **Frontier Rule:** Pareto over `{purpose ↑, risk ↓, cost ↓, time ↓}`.
* **Evidence Hooks:** which observations/evaluations populate each characteristic.

**(b) Priors Card — “What we believe before seeing data.”**

* **Default priors** on uncertainty for each characteristic (e.g., Beta for adoption probability).
* **Bridge policy:** minimal CL acceptable for imported profiles.
* **Exploration prior:** initial exploration share as a function of prior entropy.

**(c) Objective Variants Card — “Admissible objective shapes.”**

* Catalog the *few* objective forms this Context allows (lexicographic tie‑break, ε‑constraint, max‑min fairness), with **didactic pictures** of their frontiers.
* State when to switch objective (e.g., during bootstrapping vs exploitation).

**(d) Ready‑to‑use transforms** *(MM‑CHR aligned)*

* Monotone maps (e.g., log utility), normalizations, ordinal→interval “do & don’t” (only with evidence of order‑to‑interval validity).
* **Forbidden transforms** list (e.g., averaging ordinal ranks).

These cards are *conceptual fixtures*; **Tooling** may implement them, **Pedagogy** may teach them, but **C.17** only standardises their content as **thinking affordances**.

### 22 · Placement sanity‑check across the pattern language** *(avoid scope creep)

* **MM‑CHR (C.16):** defines **Characteristic/Scale/Unit/Measure** and the *characterisation discipline*. **All** CS dimensions live there; C.17 **uses** them, never re‑defines scales.
* **A.CHR‑SPACE (A.19):** exports **CharacteristicSpace & Dynamics hooks**; C.17 is a **Contexted specialisation** for creative reasoning (profiles/portfolios/selection).
* **Decsn‑CAL (C.11):** hosts **objective functions, constraints, preference orders, utility proofs**, and the **search–exploit dynamics** as decision policies. C.17 only **names** the hooks (objective, rule), keeps policy math out.
* **KD‑CAL (C.2) & B.3 (Trust):** carry **evidence provenance**, **assurance** and **congruence penalties (CL)** for Cross‑context reuse. C.17 requires anchors; it does not invent confidence calculus.
* **Compose‑CAL (C.13):** governs **set/union/slice** aggregation; the portfolio set is a **Γ\_m.set** over profiles; frontier is derived **without** ad‑hoc geometry.
* **B.4 Canonical Evolution Loop:** where *Run→Observe→Refine→Deploy* sits. C.17 supplies the **view** in which refinement is judged.

**Out of scope here:** team staffing, budgeting workflows, data‑governance procedures, ticket states, any “how to manage people”. This pattern organises **thought**, not **teams**.

### 23 · Anti‑patterns & canonical rewrites (conceptual hygiene)

1. **characteristic‑speak.** “Along the novelty characteristic…” → **Rewrite:** “Along the **Novelty characteristic** (ordinal; higher is better)…”.
2. **Pretty hulls.** Drawing a convex hull and calling it a frontier → **Rewrite:** compute Pareto under declared characteristic polarities.
3. **Ordinal arithmetic.** Averaging ranks or Likert values → **Rewrite:** either treat as **ordinal** and use **order‑safe** operators, or justify an interval mapping via MM‑CHR evidence.
4. **Proxy tyranny.** Single composite index driving choice unseen → **Rewrite:** publish **primitive characteristics**, index formula, and sensitivity.
5. **Policy‑as‑math.** “10% wild bets” as a rule → **Rewrite:** declare an **exploration dynamics** tied to value‑of‑information; if keeping a heuristic, label it as such.
6. **Global meaning.** Porting a profile from another Context by name → **Rewrite:** attach a **Bridge** with CL and loss notes; adjust trust, not scales.
7. **Plan‑profile blur.** Putting milestones into profiles → **Rewrite:** move schedules to `U.WorkPlan`; keep CS for *how options compare*, not *how to execute*.

### 24 · Minimal didactic cards (one screen each)

**(1) Profile Card**

* **Option id & Context**
* **Characteristics table** (value, unit/scale, uncertainty split)
* **Evidence anchors** (Observation/Evaluation ids)
* **Notes** (bridges used, CL penalties)

**(2) Portfolio‑with‑Rule Card**

* **Set of candidate profiles (refs)**
* **Objective & constraints** (Decsn‑CAL pointer)
* **Dominance subset** & **Frontier snapshot** (with TimeWindow)
* **Delta vs previous** (entered/exited/moved)

**(3) Search–Exploit Card** *(conceptual)*

* **Exploration share** as function of **marginal VOI** (symbolic)
* **Update cadence** (TimeWindow policy)
* **Stop conditions** (e.g., VOI below threshold; risk bound reached)

**(4) RSCR Summary Card**

* **What changed?** (refit/Δ±)
* **Sentinels status**
* **Frontier churn**
* **Bridge CL drift**

These cards are **thinking scaffolds**; they do not prescribe org process.

### 25 · Consequences (informative)

| Benefit                    | Why it matters                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **context‑local rigour**      | Creative comparison is made decidable *where meaning lives*; Cross‑context reuse is explicit and penalised only in trust, not scale. |
| **Frontier honesty**       | Decisions rest on declared characteristics and polarities; frontiers follow rules, not taste.                                     |
| **Temporal comparability** | RSCR prevents silent drift; “better/worse” claims retain meaning over iterations.                                                 |
| **Method independence**    | Any tooling can implement the cards; C.17 remains a conceptual API for thought.                                                   |

**Trade‑offs:** upfront ceremony (declare characteristics, polarity, TimeWindow) and disciplined bridges. The payoff is comparability and explainability.

### 26· Open questions (non‑normative, research hooks)**

* **Information geometry of CS:** can certain Contexts justify canonical distance metrics across characteristics without violating MM‑CHR parsimony?
* **Multi‑agent exploration:** how to couple individual CS frontiers into a *co‑exploration* equilibrium without importing team governance?
* **Learning‑to‑rank vs measurement:** what minimal evidence suffices to treat an ordinal characteristic as interval for the purpose of frontier estimation?


## C.18 — NQD‑CAL — Open‑Ended Search Calculus \[A]

**Status.** Architheory specification (**CAL**). Exports `Γ_nqd.*` operators for open‑ended, illumination‑style generation. **ΔKernel = 0** (no kernel primitives added).

**Depends on.** A‑kernel (A.1–A.15), **MM‑CHR** (C.16) for measurements, **KD‑CAL** for similarity/corpora, **Sys‑CAL** for carriers, **Decsn‑CAL** (objectives; advisory), **Compose‑CAL** (set aggregation; advisory).

**Coordinates with.** **B.5.2.1** (binding), **C.17 Creativity‑CHR** (characteristics & scales), **C.19 E/E‑LOG** (policies: emitter selection, explore/exploit).

**Exports (CAL).**
- Types: `U.DescriptorMap`, `U.NQDArchive`, `U.Niche`, `U.ArchiveCell`, `U.EmissionSeed?`, `U.EmitterPolicyRef`, `U.IlluminationSummary`.
- Operators (Γ):
  - `Γ_nqd.generate(seed?, EmitterPolicyRef, Budget, DescriptorMapRef, QualityMeasures, NoveltyMetricRef, CoverageGrid, CellCapacity K=1, EpsilonDominance ε=0, DedupThreshold?) → CandidateSet`
  - `Γ_nqd.updateArchive(Archive, CandidateSet) → Archive'`
  - `Γ_nqd.illuminate(Archive) → IlluminationSummary{coverage, QD-score, occupancyEntropy, filledCells}` (reporting gauge only; not a dominance characteristic unless a policy explicitly promotes it).
  - `Γ_nqd.selectFront(Archive|CandidateSet, characteristics={Q components, Novelty@context, ΔDiversity_P, …}) → ParetoFront`

**Type notes.**
- `U.DescriptorMap : Hypothesis → ℝ^d` (declares encoder, invariances, version).
- `U.NQDArchive` holds per‑cell elites and genealogy refs; context‑local.
- `U.Niche` is a region in DescriptorSpace (grid bucket / CVT centroid / cluster).
- `U.EmitterPolicyRef` points to a named policy in **C.19 E/E‑LOG**.
- `U.IlluminationSummary` is a **gauge** over `Diversity_P` (see C.17), not a dominance characteristic.

**Operator specs (normative).**
- `Γ_nqd.generate(...)` SHALL:
  (a) respect **Budget**,  
  (b) compute `{Q_i}` (vector), `N_i` (Novelty@context), `D_i := ΔDiversity_P(h_i | Pool)` under the same DescriptorSpace & TimeWindow as the Pool, and optional `S_i` (Surprise),
  (c) deduplicate by `DedupThreshold` in DescriptorSpace,  
  (d) record `metricsEdition`, `DescriptorMapRef`, `EmitterPolicyRef`, `ε`, `K`, `Seeds`, and genealogy references (parent/seed ids) to enable SSU measurement.
- `Γ_nqd.updateArchive` SHALL apply local competition per cell (keep up to K elites) and preserve genealogy.
- `Γ_nqd.illuminate` SHALL return coverage and QD‑score computed against the declared grid and archive edition.
- `Γ_nqd.selectFront` SHALL compute the (ε‑)Pareto front over the declared characteristics; **Illumination** is excluded by default (report‑only).  
  **Pipeline:** apply **Eligibility (ConstraintFit=pass)** → **Dominance (default set)** → **Tie‑breakers (Surprise, Illumination gauge)**.
- **Pure academic QD-mode:** Contexts MAY elect a _pure‑QD_ mode (dominance on `Q` only; `N/ΔD` used via archive occupancy and tie‑breakers). Deviation SHALL be declared by policy id and recorded in provenance.

**Reproducibility & editions.** Each call SHALL emit provenance sufficient for replay: `{metricsEdition, DescriptorMapRef (encoder+corpus edition), EmitterPolicyRef (params), ε, K, Seeds, TimeWindow}`. Changing encoder/corpus/policy parameters creates a **new edition**.

**Measurement alignment.** `Novelty@context`, `Use‑Value (ValueGain)`, `Surprise`, `Diversity_P` SHALL be measured per **C.17** (MM‑CHR templates). **IlluminationSummary** is a gauge over `Diversity_P` (coverage/QD‑score).

**Conformance (C.18/Γ).**
- **C18‑1** Declare `DescriptorMap` (encoder, invariances, corpus edition) before generation.
- **C18‑2** Record `EmitterPolicyRef` (policy id from C.19) and parameter set.
- **C18‑3** Compute `D = ΔDiversity_P(h | Pool)` under the same DescriptorMap & TimeWindow as the Pool (see C.17).
- **C18‑4** Exclude Illumination from dominance unless policy explicitly promotes it.
- **C18‑5** Keep `Use‑Value` separate from assurance scores; do not alter `F/G/R` semantics (see B.3, C.17 §Use‑Value).
- **C18‑6** Emit full provenance; thinning after front computation MUST be recorded.
- **C18‑7** Before computing any front, apply **ConstraintFit = pass** as a hard eligibility filter.
- **C18‑8** `Γ_nqd.selectFront` SHALL exclude **Illumination** from the dominance characteristics unless the Context policy explicitly promotes it (see C.19).

**Defaults (if policy is unspecified)**  
>  **Dominance:** `{Q components, Novelty@context, ΔDiversity_P}`, with `ConstraintFit=pass` as **eligibility gate**.  
> **Tie‑breakers:** `Surprise`, `Illumination (gauge over Diversity_P)`.   > **Archive:** `K=1`, `ε=0`, deduplication in `DescriptorSpace`.  
> **Policy:** UCB‑class with moderate temperature; `explore_share ≈ 0.3–0.5`.  
> **Provenance (minimum):** record `DescriptorMapRef`, `metricsEdition`, `EmitterPolicyRef`, `TimeWindow`, `Seeds`.

**Didactic quickstart (Context).**
1) Pick 2–4 Quality coordinates and a simple DescriptorMap (2–4 dims).  
2) Set defaults: `K=1`, `ε=0`, a conservative `EmitterPolicy`.  
3) Run `Γ_nqd.generate` to fixed Budget; inspect the front; log coverage (IlluminationSummary).  
4) Apply abductive plausibility filters; promote prime hypothesis to L0.

## C.19 — E/E‑LOG — Explore–Exploit Governor

**Status.** Architheory specification (**LOG**). Defines exploration/exploitation policies and selection lenses. **No Γ operators** are exported; policies parameterize calls in **C.18 NQD‑CAL**.
**Agency note.** Decisions are taken by a **system in role**. **Contexts publish** measurement spaces and admissible policies as **semantic frames**; LOG profiles lenses and policies but does **not** enact choices.
**Depends on.** **C.18 NQD‑CAL** (generators), **C.17 Creativity‑CHR** (measurements), **Decsn‑CAL** (objectives/constraints, scalarization lenses), **B.3** (trust adjustments), **Compose‑CAL** (set aggregation; advisory).

**EmitterPolicy (named profile).** A context‑local, versioned policy with fields:
`{ name, class ∈ {UCB, Thompson, BO‑EI, GP‑UCB, PES, …}, params, explore_share∈[0,1], temperature τ≥0, rebalance_period, wild_bet_quota≥0, backstop_confidence (assurance level), epsilon_dominance ε, cell_capacity K }`.
Policies are referenced as `U.EmitterPolicyRef` by NQD generator call (C.18) and are conceptual lenses, not staffing/budget instructions.

**Defaults (if policy is unspecified):**  
• **Dominance:** `{Q components, Novelty@context, ΔDiversity_P}`, with `ConstraintFit=pass` as **eligibility gate**.  
• **Tie‑breakers:** `Surprise`, `Illumination (gauge over Diversity_P)`.  
• **Archive:** `K=1`, `ε=0`, deduplication in `DescriptorSpace`.  
• **Policy:** UCB‑class with moderate temperature; `explore_share ≈ 0.3–0.5`.  
• **Provenance (minimum):** record `DescriptorMapRef`, `metricsEdition`, `EmitterPolicyRef`, `TimeWindow`, `Seeds`.

**Scalarization lenses (policy‑level).** A lens `J_ℓ` declares: (a) hard eligibility conditions (e.g., ConstraintFit=pass), (b) soft aggregation (weights/curves), (c) trust policy (how assurance/CL discounts enter).  
**Conformance.** A Context MUST name the lens used to pick from a frontier; scalarized rankings MUST NOT be presented as “the frontier”; the **`lens id MUST be recorded in provenance of each selection`**.


**Promotion rules (policy).**  
- **Tie‑breaks.**  `Surprise` and `Illumination` MAY act as tie‑breakers; **promotion into the dominance set MUST be declared by lens or policy id** and captured in provenance.
- **Graduation.** Profiles graduate from Explore→Exploit when **backstop_confidence** (B.3 level) and eligibility conditions are met.  
- **Sunset/Pivot.** Profiles failing VOI/backstop thresholds are sunset or pivoted at `rebalance_period`.

**Explore/Exploit loop (per rebalance_period).**
1) Recompute frontier with trust discounts.  
2) Enforce `explore_share` (minimum attention on high‑Novelty, not‑yet‑proven profiles).  
3) Update generator `temperature τ` / emitter mix.  
4) Apply `backstop_confidence` to graduate; sunset stale probes.  
5) Satisfy `wild_bet_quota` by seeding fresh high‑Novelty candidates.

**Named lenses (heuristics; policy‑level, not norms)**
The following **lens profiles** are **illustrative heuristics**. Contexts MAY reuse/modify them; they are **not** normative.
• **Frontier‑sweeper** — maintain attention on the full front; promote only when `backstop_confidence` holds.  
• **Barbell** — enforce `explore_share ≥ θ` with a `wild_bet_quota`; otherwise exploit top‑trust region.  
• **Spike‑first** — pick highest **Use‑Value** subject to `ConstraintFit=pass` and a small **Cost‑to‑Probe** cap.  
• **Safety‑first** — minimize **SafetyRisk** subject to `Use‑Value ≥ θ` and `ConstraintFit=pass`.  
• **Platform‑option** — maximize **Option‑Value** under probe cost bounds.  
• **Pilot‑then‑scale** — optimize **Use‑Value** on pilot scope with `BackstopConfidence ≥ L1`; widen `G` once **R** holds.  
**Conformance (lens recording).** A decision that uses any lens **MUST** record its **lens id** alongside `EmitterPolicyRef`. (This restates and localizes C19‑3.)

**Conformance (C.19/LOG).**
- **C19‑1** Each NQD generator call (C.18) **SHALL** cite `U.EmitterPolicyRef` (policy id + params).
- **C19‑2** The characteristic set & signs used for dominance **MUST** be declared; eligibility conditions applied first. *(References to C.18 generator operators are descriptive only; LOG exports no Γ.)*
- **C19‑3** If a lens is used, its id MUST be recorded; do not label scalarized top‑1 as “frontier”.  
- **C19‑4** Promotion of Surprise/Illumination into dominance MUST be explicit in policy.  
- **C19‑5** USM/RSG gate applies: policy actions SHALL operate within the Context’s scope and enactable RSG states.
- **C19‑6** Each selection lens **MUST** implement and document the pipeline` Eligibility (ConstraintFit=pass) → Dominance (declared set) → Tie‑breakers (declared)`. Any **promotion** of Surprise/Illumination into the dominance set **MUST** be named by lens/policy id and recorded in provenance.

**Illumination & Diversity_P.** Illumination is a **gauge over Diversity_P** (coverage/QD‑score). It informs exploration health and tie‑breaks; it is **not** a dominance characteristic by default.

**Baseline profile (informative, context‑local template).**
`EmitterPolicy#NQD-Default-2025`:
    class=`UCB`, explore_share=`0.3–0.5`, temperature `τ=moderate`,
    rebalance_period=`Context default`, wild_bet_quota=`≥0`,
    backstop_confidence=`policy L1`, epsilon_dominance=`ε=0`,
    cell_capacity=`K=1`.
Contexts MAY clone/adjust; if used, record its id in provenance.

**Didactic quickstart (Context).**
- Start with policy class = `UCB` or `Thompson`; set `explore_share≈0.3–0.5`, `τ` moderate.  
- Name the dominance set: `{Q components, Novelty@context, ΔDiversity_P}` with `ConstraintFit=pass` as gate.  
  *(Use‑Value / Cost‑to‑Probe may appear in **lenses** or **constraints**; they are **not** in the default dominance set.)*
- Pick a lens for the final choice (or stick to frontier if undecided); record the lens id in the decision memo.

### **Pattern D.5 — Bias-Audit & Ethical Assurance \[A]

**Context**

FPF is designed to produce reliable, objective, and trustworthy holons. However, formal correctness (`FV` score) and empirical validation (`EV` score) are not sufficient on their own. Any artifact created by humans or trained on human-generated data is susceptible to hidden cognitive, cultural, and algorithmic biases. A perfectly verified control system can still be unsafe if its requirements were based on a biased assumption about operator behavior. A highly accurate machine learning model can be deeply unfair if its training data was not representative.

**Problem**

Without a formal, repeatable method for surfacing and mitigating these biases, FPF models risk becoming "flawed by design." This leads to three critical failure modes:

1.  **Systemic Harm:** The deployed holon, despite meeting all its technical specifications, causes unintended negative consequences for certain groups or in certain contexts.
2.  **Eroded Trust:** Stakeholders or the public lose trust in the system (and its creators) when its inherent biases are exposed after deployment.
3.  **Hidden Risk:** The assurance case appears strong on paper, but it is built on a foundation of unexamined and potentially dangerous assumptions, creating a significant hidden risk.

**Forces**

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Objectivity vs. Inevitable Subjectivity** | How to strive for objective, neutral models while acknowledging that all creation is influenced by the subjective perspectives of the creators. |
| **Speed of Delivery vs. Depth of Reflection** | How to integrate a thoughtful ethical review process without paralyzing the agile, iterative cycles of development. |
| **Expertise vs. Inclusivity** | How to leverage specialized ethical expertise without disenfranchising the core engineering team from moral responsibility. |
| **Process vs. Culture** | Is ethical assurance a bureaucratic checklist to be completed, or a cultural practice of continuous self-critique? |

**Solution**

FPF introduces the **Bias-Audit Cycle (BA-Cycle)**, a lightweight, iterative ceremony designed to integrate ethical reflection directly into the engineering development cycle. It is not a one-time gate but a continuous loop of inquiry.

**1. The Bias-Audit Cycle: Four Phases**

The cycle consists of four distinct phases, aligned with the project's natural rhythm.

| Phase | Trigger | Core Activity | Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **BA-0: Kick-off** | Project start or major new feature. | **Framing the ethical scope.** The team identifies potential areas of bias and creates an initial, living document called the **Bias Register**. | A skeleton Bias Register with initial questions. |
| **BA-1: Rapid Scan**| End of each sprint or design session. | **Continuous lightweight check.** A rotating member of the core team (the *Engineer-Scrutineer*) quickly scans recent changes against a checklist, flagging potential issues in the Bias Register. | Updated Bias Register with new items flagged for discussion. |
| **BA-2: Panel Review**| Before a major integration or release decision (e.g., before moving to the `Evidence` state). | **Deep, multi-perspective critique.** A small panel, including individuals in roles like **Ethicist**, **Domain Sociologist**, and **UX Design Critic**, reviews the flagged items and proposes concrete mitigations. | A structured, auditable artifact called the **Bias-Audit Report**, documenting findings and required actions. |
| **BA-3: Closure** | At the release freeze. | **Ensuring accountability.** The facilitator confirms that all "blocking" issues from the Bias-Audit Report have either been resolved or have a documented, accepted risk. | The final Bias-Audit Report is marked as *resolved* or *risk-accepted* for that release. |

**2. The Bias Taxonomy: A Shared Language for Critique**

To structure the audit, FPF provides a minimal, extensible taxonomy of common bias categories.

| Code | Bias Category | Manager's View: The Simple Question to Ask |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **REP** | **Representation Bias** | "Whose voice, data, or perspective is missing from this model?" |
| **ALG** | **Algorithmic Bias** | "Could our automated rule or formula unintentionally amplify unfairness for minority or edge cases?" |
| **VIS** | **Visual Framing Bias** | "Does this diagram, color choice, or dashboard visualization steer the user towards a preferred conclusion?" |
| **MET** | **Metric Proxy Bias** | "Are we chasing a metric that is easy to measure, at the expense of the real, harder-to-measure objective?" (Connects to ADR-015) |
| **LNG** | **Lexical Bias** | "Do our naming choices (e.g., 'master/slave', 'blacklist/whitelist') encode unintended value judgments or historical baggage?" |

> **Didactic Note for Managers: This is Risk Management, Not a Philosophy Seminar**
>
> The Bias-Audit Cycle is FPF's "immune system." It's designed to find and neutralize hidden assumptions before they become costly product failures or public relations disasters. Think of it like a security audit, but for the ethical and social integrity of your system.
>
> *   **It's not about being "perfect"; it's about being "aware."** The goal is not to eliminate all bias (an impossible task) but to make your team's biases explicit, documented, and consciously managed.
> *   **It's cost-effective.** The lightweight "Rapid Scan" catches most issues early, during a sprint. The more intensive "Panel Review" is reserved for key moments, ensuring that expert time is used efficiently.
> *   **It creates a defensible record.** The Bias-Audit Reports provide a clear, auditable trail showing that your team has taken a systematic and responsible approach to identifying and mitigating potential harms. In an era of increasing scrutiny on AI and autonomous systems, this record is not just good practice—it's a critical business asset.

**3. Normative Artifacts**

The Bias-Audit Cycle produces two key conceptual artifacts that serve as the auditable record of ethical deliberation.

*   **The Bias Register:**
    *   **Nature:** A living, evolving **episteme** that serves as a repository of questions, concerns, and potential biases identified throughout a holon's evolution.
    *   **Content:** It is a structured collection of inquiries, organized by the Bias Taxonomy (REP, ALG, etc.). It is continuously updated during the Rapid Scans (BA-1) and represents the "running log" of ethical and bias-related considerations for the project.

*   **The Bias-Audit Report:**
    *   **Nature:** A formal, versioned **episteme** that documents the findings of the Panel Review (BA-2).
    *   **Content:** It contains a structured record of findings. Each finding is a `U.Episteme` with attributes for:
        *   `biasCode`: The category from the Bias Taxonomy.
        *   `severity`: An ordinal level (`high`, `medium`, `low`).
        *   `description`: A narrative explaining the issue.
        *   `mitigation`: A proposed `U.Method` or `U.ConstraintRule` to address the issue.
        *   `status`: A state (`blocking`, `resolved`, `risk-accepted`).
    *   **Conceptual Example:**
        *   `finding-01`: An episteme with `biasCode: REP`, `severity: high`, and a `description` stating that the training data for a recognition holon lacks representation from certain demographics. The `mitigation` would be a `U.Method` for acquiring a balanced dataset, and the `status` would be `blocking` until this method is executed and its outcome validated.

**Conformance Checklist**

*   **CC-D5.1 (Cycle Mandate):** Any project developing a holon that interacts with or makes decisions about humans **MUST** conduct the Bias-Audit Cycle.
*   **CC-D5.2 (Artifact Mandate):** The project **MUST** maintain a **Bias Register** and produce a **Bias-Audit Report** before any major release.
*   **CC-D5.3 (Blocking Issue Mandate):** A release **SHALL NOT** be considered conformant if its latest Bias-Audit Report contains any unresolved findings with `status: blocking`. The issue must either be moved to `resolved` (mitigated) or `risk-accepted` (formally signed off by a designated authority).
*   **CC-D5.4 (Role Mandate):** The Panel Review (BA-2) **MUST** involve at least three individuals representing distinct perspectives, ideally aligning with the roles of *Ethicist*, *Domain Sociologist*, and *UX Design Critic* from the Intellect Stack.

**Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them**

| Anti-Pattern | Manager's View: What It Looks Like | How FPF Prevents It (Conceptually) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The "Ethics Ghetto"** | One person is the "ethics officer," and the rest of the engineering team sees bias as "not my job." | The **Rapid Scan (BA-1)** is a conceptual activity performed by a rotating member of the core team. This distributes the responsibility for ethical reflection across all roles. |
| **The "Checklist Charade"** | The team mechanically answers "yes/no" to bias questions just before a release, without any real reflection, simply to satisfy a process requirement. | The **Panel Review (BA-2)** is a moment of deep, multi-perspective critique that a perfunctory checklist cannot survive. The requirement for a structured **Bias-Audit Report** also forces concrete findings and mitigation methods, not just checkmarks. |
| **The "Bias Whack-a-Mole"** | The team fixes one bias issue, only for another to pop up, because they are only addressing symptoms. | The **Bias Taxonomy** encourages a more systematic approach. By considering categories like Representation (REP) and Metric Proxy (MET), the team is prompted to look for root causes (e.g., flawed data collection methods or poorly chosen objectives) rather than just patching individual algorithmic flaws. |

**Consequences**

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Proactive Risk Mitigation:** The cycle surfaces and addresses potential ethical and social harms *before* they are deployed, preventing costly failures and reputational damage. | **Additional Ceremony:** The cycle introduces new conceptual steps and artifacts into the workflow. *Mitigation:* The process is designed to be lightweight and to align with existing agile cadences (e.g., the Rapid Scan is a brief conceptual check at the end of a sprint). |
| **Creates an Auditable Ethical Record:** The Bias-Audit Reports provide a transparent, defensible trail demonstrating that the organization has a systematic process for managing ethical risks. | **Finding the Right Expertise:** It may be challenging to find individuals to fill the required roles. *Mitigation:* These roles represent perspectives, not necessarily formal job titles. The key is the diversity of viewpoints. |
| **Builds a Culture of Responsibility:** By making ethical reflection a routine part of the engineering process, the cycle fosters a culture where every team member is empowered and expected to think critically about the broader impact of their work. | - |
| **Improves Holon Quality:** Designing for a wider range of users and edge cases, as prompted by the audit, often leads to more robust, user-friendly, and innovative holons. | - |

**Rationale**

Formal correctness is not a substitute for moral responsibility. This pattern recognizes that bias is not an occasional flaw but a systemic feature of any human-led design process. The Bias-Audit Cycle is FPF's formal mechanism for managing this reality. It is a direct implementation of the **Cross-Disciplinary Bias Audit Guard-Rail (E.5.4)**.

By integrating this cycle into the core reasoning workflow, FPF moves ethical assurance from a peripheral, often-ignored "nice-to-have" into a central, non-negotiable component of engineering excellence. It ensures that the powerful tools of formal reasoning and validation provided by FPF are always directed towards creating holons that are not only correct, but also conscionable.

**Relations**

*   **Implements:** The `Cross-Disciplinary Bias Audit` Guard-Rail (E.5.4).
*   **Complements:** `D.4 Trust-Aware Mediation Calculus` by providing inputs on fairness and value alignment; `B.3.4 Evidence Decay & Epistemic Debt` by questioning the longevity of assumptions about social context.
*   **Operationalizes:** The conceptual roles of `Ethicist`, `Domain Sociologist`, and `UX Design Critic` from the Intellect Stack.

# **Part E · FPF Constitution and Authoring Cluster**

### Section E‑I · The FPF Constitution

#### Pattern E.1 — Vision & Mission: “Operating System for Thought”  \[A]

##### Context
Modern engineering, science, and strategy all suffer from **conceptual overload**: dozens of domain tools, drifting vocabularies, and disconnected “best practices” splinter ideas as they travel from napkin sketch to certified deliverable. Stakeholders—*Engineers, Researchers, Learners*—lack a single, evolvable scaffold that can carry an insight across that span.

##### Problem
Absent such a scaffold, every discipline re‑invents epistemology and systems thinking, spawning silos, steep learning curves, and brittle life‑cycle models. Previous attempts either froze agility in rigid hierarchies or dissolved rigour in tool‑centric jargon.

##### Forces

| Force                           | Tension                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conceptual Unity**            | Freedom to evolve ↔ invariant principles that prevent vocabulary drift. |
| **Rigor vs Agility**            | Formal verifiability ↔ rapid, iterative exploration.                    |
| **Universality vs Specificity** | Domain‑agnostic kernel ↔ problem‑specific leverage.                     |
| **Didactic Clarity**            | Human comprehension ↔ abstract purity and density.                      |
| **Physical Grounding**          | Abstract constructs ↔ a *material Transformer* that proves feasibility.     |

**Mission Statement**

> *Enable any motivated system/actor/agent/transformer — human or AI — to transform a raw idea into a reproducible, auditable change in the physical world through incremental, falsifiable cycles.*

**Vision Statement**

> *Reliable reasoning should be as accessible as version control: clone the conceptual kernel, extend it with domain plugins, and commit decisions that remain traceable across time, scale, and discipline.*

##### Solution — *FPF as an Operating System for Thought*
FPF delivers a **generative scaffold** realised as:

1. a **micro‑kernel** of non‑derivable, cross‑domain **first principles**;
2. pluggable **architheories**—Systemic Calculus, Knowledge Dynamics, etc.—that instantiate those principles;
3. a **pattern language** (*Architectural* ► why/ how; *Definitional* ► what) with embedded **Conformance Checklist (CC)**;
4. **Design Rationale Records (DRRs)** that govern safe, auditable evolution;
5. three **core invariants** that every artefact must honour

   * **Evolvability** — change is expected and governed;
   * **Cross‑Scale Coherence** — the same algebra binds parts to wholes at any level;
   * **Didactic Transparency** — each element exposes its own reasoning path.

** Conformance Checklist**

| ID              | Requirement                                                                                                                                          | Rationale                                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑Vision.1** | Every composite artefact **MUST** cite a *material Transformer* that can, in principle, perform the aggregation (`Γ(D,C)`) that produced it.             | Ensures physical feasibility and auditability.  |
| **CC‑Vision.2** | Every normative rule **MUST** demonstrably support at least one core invariant (*Evolvability, Cross‑Scale Coherence, Didactic Transparency*).       | Keeps the Canon lean and purpose‑driven.        |
| **CC‑Vision.3** | Conceptual text **MUST NOT** contain tokens black‑listed by the **DevOps Lexical Firewall** (`yaml`, `docker`, …).                                   | Preserves layer purity and tool‑agnostic core.  |
| **CC‑Vision.4** | A conformant artefact **MUST** state a measurable benefit for at least one of the three roles (*Engineer, Researcher, Learner*) or justify omission. | Aligns success with stakeholder trajectories.   |

##### Consequences

*Positive* — Unified language accelerates cross‑disciplinary discovery; regulators can audit claim lineages; learners acquire concepts through the spec itself.
*Trade‑offs* — Authors face an initial learning curve and must trace every rule to an invariant; disciplined traceability is required to prevent variant sprawl.

##### Relations & Precedence
Pattern E.1 governs **E.2 Eleven Pillars** and the Guard‑Rail set **A.5–A.8**; any later pattern that conflicts with E.1 **MUST** be revised via a DRR before entering the Canon.

*“Purpose without a scaffold is wishful thinking; a scaffold without purpose is cargo‑cult—FPF welds the two into disciplined imagination.”*

#### E.2 — The Eleven Pillars \[A] 

##### Context 
Pattern E.1 set the FPF mission as an **operating system for thought**. To turn that mission into a durable architecture, FPF needs a small, explicit constitution—principles that remain stable while everything built on top of them can evolve. Without such invariants, domain silos, vocabulary drift, and tool‑centric shortcuts quickly erode coherence and reproducibility across disciplines.

##### Problem
Frameworks without binding first principles wobble between two extremes: rigid dogmas that kill adaptation and amorphous guidelines that invite cognitive chaos. In either case, reasoning fragments, auditability collapses, and physical impact suffers.

##### Forces
| Force                          | Tension                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Foundational Stability**     | Immutable core ↔ perpetual adaptation to new knowledge |
| **Cognitive Load**             | Minimal elegance ↔ comprehensive coverage              |
| **Rigor vs Accessibility**     | Formal soundness ↔ intuitive entry for non‑specialists |
| **Universality vs Modularity** | Domain‑agnostic scope ↔ plug‑in extensibility          |
| **Pragmatic Grounding**        | Abstract invariants ↔ measurable, falsifiable outcomes |

##### Solution
FPF rests on **eleven non‑negotiable pillars**. Each pillar is a binding constraint that every artefact, pattern, and design‑rationale record (DRR) **must** honour. Together they form the load‑bearing structure that guarantees evolvability, cross‑scale coherence, and didactic clarity.

| ID       | Pillar                         | Essence                                                                                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P‑1**  | **Cognitive Elegance**         | Highlight decisive structure, eliminate ornamental formalism; separate data governance from thinking.                     |
| **P‑2**  | **Didactic Primacy**           | Human comprehension outranks theoretical or tooling purity.                                                               |
| **P‑3**  | **Scalable Formality**         | A single artefact can mature step‑by‑step from informal guess to formally assured state without forks or rewrites.        |
| **P‑4**  | **Open‑Ended Kernel**          | The micro‑kernel contains only meta‑concepts; all domain knowledge lives in external architheories.                       |
| **P‑5**  | **Plug‑in Layering**           | Architheories are modular, declarative extensions that can be added, replaced, or removed without destabilising the core. |
| **P‑6**  | **Lexical Stratification**     | Every core concept is expressible in four registers: plain name, technical term, formal U.Type, and mathematical symbol.  |
| **P‑7**  | **Pragmatic Utility**          | Proofs, metrics, and models exist to achieve real‑world objectives; falsification is rewarded over confirmation.          |
| **P‑8**  | **Cross‑Scale Consistency**    | Composition algebras (aggregation, boundary, emergence) are invariant across material systems, knowledge, and methods.    |
| **P‑9**  | **State Explicitness**         | Every artefact declares its state (`design‑time`, `run‑time`, etc.); transitions are cheap, traceable, auditable.         |
| **P‑10** | **Open‑Ended Evolution**       | Every entity is expected to evolve indefinitely; cycles must remain cheap, safe, and cognitively rewarding.               |
| **P‑11** | **State‑of‑the‑Art Alignment** | The kernel and architheories track reliable contemporary knowledge and update when the SoTA advances.                     |

> Any DRR that contradicts a pillar must first amend this constitutional pattern.

##### Conformance Checklist

| ID         | Requirement                                                                                                                       | Purpose                               |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑P‑1** | Every architectural pattern **must** list which pillar(s) it instantiates or refines.                                             | Guarantees constitutional grounding.  |
| **CC‑P‑2** | Every DRR proposing a normative change **must** include a “Pillar Impact Analysis.”                                               | Makes constitutional review explicit. |
| **CC‑P‑3** | Tooling and pedagogical artefacts **should** document which pillar(s) shape their design.                                         | Upholds P‑2 (Didactic Primacy).       |
| **CC‑P‑4** | An architheory is conformant only if its invariants reference **≥ 3** pillars, demonstrating cross‑scale and pragmatic alignment. | Prevents narrow, siloed extensions.   |

##### Consequences

*Positive*

* Provides an explicit “north star” for every contributor.
* Delivers a falsifiable checklist for evaluating proposals.
* Builds trust in high‑assurance domains through transparency.

*Trade‑offs*

* Constitutional review adds friction to rapid, informal changes.
* Amending the pillar set itself demands high‑bar governance.

##### Rationale

The pillars are distilled from systems engineering, philosophy of science, software architecture, and ontology design. They interlock: *Cognitive Elegance* (P‑1) enables *Didactic Primacy* (P‑2); *Open‑Ended Kernel* (P‑4) and *Plug‑in Layering* (P‑5) make *Open‑Ended Evolution* (P‑10) and *SoTA alignment* (P‑11) feasible; *Cross‑Scale Consistency* (P‑8) provides the algebraic backbone for *Scalable Formality* (P‑3). This minimal yet sufficient set balances stability with change, rigor with accessibility, and abstraction with measurable impact.

##### Relations
* **Depends on:** `pat:constitutional/vision` – pillars operationalise the mission.
* **Refined by:** All subsequent patterns in the Core Specification.
* **Governs:** Every DRR, tool, and pedagogical artefact linked to FPF.

*These pillars are not a cage but the load‑bearing columns of a workshop where ideas can be safely built, dismantled, and evolved.*

#### Pattern E.3 — **Principle Taxonomy & Precedence Model** \[A] 

##### Context
Pattern E.2 supplies eleven immutable pillars, yet experience shows that a **flat list of principles invites ambiguity**: reviewers cannot decide which pillar overrules another  and “dead‑letter” rules accumulate. 

##### Problem

When two pillars or derived principles pull in opposite directions, architectural decisions stall—or worse, drift toward the loudest voice. Without an explicit **taxonomy and precedence cascade**, FPF risks devolving into subjective debate, breaking its claim to be a rigorously *auditable* “operating system for thought.”

##### Forces
| Force                                 | Tension                                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Categorical Clarity**               | Coherent grouping ↔ preservation of individual nuance              |
| **Deterministic Conflict Resolution** | Predictable hierarchy ↔ flexibility for context‑specific overrides |
| **Evolutionary Stability**            | Durable core ↔ adaptability to new knowledge                       |

##### Solution
1. **Principle Taxonomy**
   Every principle is an instance of `U.Principle` assigned **exactly one** class ∈ { `Gov`, `Arch`, `Epist`, `Prag`, `Did` }.

   | Class                                    | Scope & Purpose                           | Example Pillars                                   |   |
   | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | - |
   | **Gov** (Governance)                     | Change process, community decision‑making | P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution · P‑11 SoTA             |   |
   | **Arch** (Architectural)                 | Macro‑structure & invariants              | P‑1 Cognitive Elegance · P‑4 Kernel               |   |
   | **Epist** (Epistemological and Ontological) | Semantics, evidence, trust                | P‑3 Scalable Formality · P‑8 Consistency          |   |
   | **Prag** (Pragmatic)                     | Real‑world value & cost/benefit           | P‑7 Pragmatic Utility                             |   |
   | **Did** (Didactic)                       | Cognition & learnability                  | P‑2 Didactic Primacy · P‑6 Lexical Stratification |   |

   *Epistemological* sub‑concerns (reasoning, falsifiability) reside inside **Onto**, avoiding category sprawl yet keeping semantics and trust in one bucket.

 2. **Precedence Stack**

   | Level | Governing Artefact                    | Overrides        |
   | ----- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
   | 0     | **Vision & Mission** (E.1)            | everything       |
   | 1     | **Eleven Pillars** (E.2)              | all below        |
   | 2     | **Principles** (this pattern)         | patterns & DRRs  |
   | 3     | Architectural / Definitional patterns | local rules      |
   | 4     | Tooling & Pedagogy                    | informative only |

**Within Level 2 of precedence stack** the default order is:
`Gov ≫ Arch ≫ Epist ≫ Prag ≫ Did`

 **Graph Rule** — The precedence graph MUST be acyclic; any new edge that would form a cycle is rejected.”
 
Conformance Checklist	CC‑PT.2 missing Purpose column; CC‑PT.3 could reference Pillar numbers explicitly.	Fill purpose for CC‑PT.2 (Prevents circular override chains).

Governance principle vs Architectural principle clash: e.g. Core release schedule (Gov) outranks performance‑tuning (Prag)

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                          | Purpose                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **CC‑PT.1** | Every principle record **MUST** state `class` and may list `precedence_over[]`.                                      | Enables deterministic overrides. |
| **CC‑PT.2** | Precedence graph **MUST** be acyclic;    | Prevents circular law.           |
| **CC‑PT.3** | Any DRR introducing/modifying a principle **MUST** include a *Pillar Impact Analysis* and proposed precedence edges impact on each affected Pillar (P‑1… P‑11)| Aligns evolution with Pillars.   |

#### Illustrative Conflict Resolution

1. **The Conflict**  
   * **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance** (`Arch`) demands an unambiguous term for “part–whole” entities, pushing us toward **Holon**.  
   * **P‑2 Didactic Primacy** (`Did`) values immediate practitioner familiarity, pushing us to retain **System**.

2. **Risk of Stalemate**  
   Without a precedence cascade, the discussion would collapse into subjective argument: *“purity beats clarity!”* vs *“clarity beats purity!”*.

3. **Applying the Precedence Model**  
   * Default order: **Gov ≫ Arch ≫ Epist ≫ Prag ≫ Did**.  
   * `Arch` outranks `Did`; therefore **P‑1** takes formal precedence over **P‑2**.

4. **Principled Decision**  
   We adopted **Holon** to satisfy the higher‑priority principle and mitigated the didactic cost by:  
   * declaring `System ≡ U.System ⊑ U.Holon`,  
   * providing aliases and an “On‑Ramp” tutorial.

> *The precedence rule did not merely name a winner; it compelled a solution that honoured both principles in proportion to their rank.*

##### Consequences
*Positive* — Turns subjective debate into objective, traceable decisions; high‑impact conflicts surface early.

##### Rationale
The chosen taxonomy mirrors FPF’s layered dependency: **Governance** rules how change occurs; **Architecture** shapes what can exist; **Epistemology** secures meaning and trust; **Pragmatics** and **Didactics** ensure usefulness and learnability. Explicit override edges supply the flexibility experts need, while the default hierarchy keeps day‑to‑day design deterministic—a “living constitution” that remains both human‑intelligible and machine‑enforceable.

##### Relations
* **Depends on:** `pat:constitutional/vision`, `pat:constitutional/pillars`
* **Governs:** All subsequent patterns and DRRs; Guard‑Rail patterns reference CC‑PT.\

> *“A taxonomy sorts principles; precedence gives them order—together they convert debate into design.”*

### **E.4 — FPF Artefact Architecture \[A]**

##### Context

The FPF ecosystem produces a wide range of artifacts, from timeless, normative principles to rapidly evolving pedagogical materials and executable tools. If these different types of artifacts are mingled without a clear architectural separation, the ecosystem becomes difficult to navigate, govern, and maintain. Users cannot easily distinguish binding rules from helpful advice, and the entire framework's release cycle becomes coupled to its most volatile component.

##### Problem

How can we structure the FPF ecosystem to ensure a clean separation of concerns between normative concepts, didactic materials, and executable tooling? A formal architecture is required to maintain conceptual purity, enable independent evolution of components, and provide a clear map for all stakeholders.

##### Forces

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stability vs. Agility** | The conceptual core must evolve slowly and deliberately ↔ tools and tutorials must iterate quickly to keep pace with technology and user needs. |
| **Authority vs. Accessibility** | Users need to know which rules are normative and binding ↔ they also need accessible, non-normative guides to help them learn. |
| **Modularity vs. Cohesion** | The different artifact families must be able to evolve independently ↔ they must remain part of a single, coherent FPF ecosystem. |

##### Solution

The FPF ecosystem is formally stratified into three canonical **artefact families**. Each family has a distinct purpose and is governed by different rules, ensuring a clear separation of concerns. The interaction between these families is governed by the **Unidirectional Dependency Principle** (see Guard-Rail E.5.3).

1.  **The Conceptual Core (The Canon):** This family contains the **normative** pattern language of FPF. It is the single source of truth for all universal concepts, rules, and invariants. It is defined to be tool-agnostic and notation-independent. This family represents the timeless "law" of FPF.

2.  **The Tooling Reference:** This family contains **executable artifacts** that implement or verify the normative rules of the Core. This includes reference linters, simulators, and data schemas. This family is the "instrument" that makes the law of the Core operational.

3.  **The Pedagogical Companion:** This family contains **non-normative, didactic materials** designed to help humans learn and apply FPF. This includes tutorials, worked examples, and playbooks. This family is the "textbook" that explains both the law and the instruments.

##### Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

*   **For a `U.System`:**
    *   **Conceptual Core:** Defines the universal pattern `U.System`.
    *   **Tooling Reference:** Provides a modeling language profile or a serialization schema for modeling systems.
    *   **Pedagogical Companion:** Provides a tutorial on how to model a water pump using that profile.

*   **For an `U.Episteme`:**
    *   **Conceptual Core:** Defines `U.Episteme` and the F-G-R characteristics.
    *   **Tooling Reference:** Provides the reference linting tool to automatically score epistemes.
    *   **Pedagogical Companion:** Provides a case study on how a scientific theory's R-score evolves over time.

##### Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CC-E.4.1** | Every artifact in the FPF ecosystem **MUST** declare which of the three families (Core, Tooling, Pedagogy) it belongs to. |
| **CC-E.4.2** | The content of each artifact **MUST** be consistent with the defined purpose of its family (e.g., no normative rules in the Pedagogical Companion). |
| **CC‑E.4.3** | Artefacts in the Tooling or Pedagogy families SHALL NOT be imported by artefacts in the Conceptual Core. |

##### Consequences

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Users and contributors can immediately identify the nature and authority of any given artifact. | **Requires Discipline:** Authors must be careful to place new content in the correct artifact family. |
| **Decoupled Release Cycles:** The Core can maintain a stable, slow release cadence, while the Tooling and Pedagogy artifact family can evolve rapidly. | - |
| **Architectural Clarity:** Provides a simple, powerful mental model for navigating the entire FPF ecosystem. | - |

##### Rationale

This pattern establishes the macro-architecture of the entire FPF ecosystem. By separating the timeless "why" and "what" (the Conceptual Core) from the practical "how" (Tooling) and the educational "how-to-learn" (Pedagogy), it creates a system that is simultaneously stable, agile, and accessible. This layered architecture is a proven pattern in large-scale systems, from the OSI model in networking to the structure of modern operating systems, and it is essential for FPF's long-term health and scalability.

##### Relations

*   **Instantiates:** **P-5 (Plugin Layering)** at a macro-level.
*   **Is Constrained by:** **E.5.3 (Unidirectional Dependency)**.
*   **Is Foundation For:** The entire authoring and governance model, as it defines the "territories" where different rules apply.

> *“A canon without a rationale is scripture; a rationale without a canon is gossip. FPF keeps both, fused in patterns.”*

###  E.5 · Four Guard‑Rails of FPF         \[A]

#### Context  
FPF positions itself as a **timeless, universal “operating system for
thought.”**  Collaborative projects of this scope face four predictable
entropic pulls:

1. **Implementation gravity** – concept prose accretes tool jargon.  
2. **Notation lock‑in** – one diagram style becomes “the language.”  
3. **Convenience cycles** – quick fixes create reverse dependencies.  
4. **Disciplinary monoculture** – implicit bias colours “universal” rules.

Left unchecked, these forces erode Pillars **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance**,
**P‑4 Open‑Ended Kernel** and **P‑5 Plug‑in Layering**.

#### Problem  
Without explicit, non‑negotiable protectors the Conceptual Core would
slowly:

* entangle with transient technology terms,  
* hard‑freeze into a single dialect,  
* devolve into a tightly coupled “big ball of mud”,  
* betray its trans‑disciplinary promise.

#### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Purity vs Pragmatism** | Preserve pristine concepts ↔ need real examples. |
| **Universality vs Convention** | Rules valid across domains ↔ convenience of one familiar notation. |
| **Modularity vs Integration** | Independent layers ↔ temptation to cross‑link for speed. |
| **Objectivity vs Perspective** | Neutral framework ↔ Transformers’ unavoidable cultural lens. |

#### Solution — the Four Guard‑Rails  
FPF establishes **four architecturally enforced guard‑rails** that every
Core, Tooling, and Pedagogy artefact must obey.  They function as an
“immune system” resisting each entropic pull.

| # | Guard‑Rail | Protects against |
|---|------------|------------------|
| **GR‑1** | **DevOps Lexical Firewall** | Implementation, governance, automatisation and DevOsp concerns gravity |
| **GR‑2** | **Notational Independence** | Notation lock‑in |
| **GR‑3** | **Unidirectional Dependency** | Convenience cycles |
| **GR‑4** | **Cross‑Disciplinary Bias Audit** | Disciplinary monoculture |

Concrete rules for each rail live in patterns **E.5.1 – E.5.4**.

#### Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Guard‑Rail | `U.System` example | `U.Episteme` example |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| GR‑1 | Definition of `U.System` never cites file formats or build scripts. | Definition of `U.Episteme` avoids naming specific proof engines. |
| GR‑2 | Pump boundary invariant is true in plain text or any diagram. | F‑G‑R semantics hold in algebraic or graph notation alike. |
| GR‑3 | A sizing helper imports Core invariants; Core never imports helper tutorials. | Learning guide cites R‑score; Core never cites guide. |
| GR‑4 | Bias audit removes thermo‑mechanical jargon from a “universal” pattern. | Audit replaces physics‑centric metaphors in a trust pattern. |

#### Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| **CC‑GR.1** | Every new Core pattern **SHALL** cite, in its *Relations* section, the guard‑rail(s) it relies on or may affect. | Ensures traceability and deliberate rule interaction. |
| **CC‑GR.2** | Artefacts classified as Tooling or Pedagogy **MUST NOT** violate any rule in GR‑1 through GR‑4. | Keeps entropic forces outside the Conceptual Core. |
| **CC‑GR.3** | A revision to any guard‑rail pattern **REQUIRES** a Design‑Rationale Record that (a) states the reason, and (b) includes a Pillar‑impact analysis per E.3 precedence model. | Aligns evolution with higher‑level principles. |
| **CC‑GR.4** | The aggregate of guard‑rail rules **MUST** remain internally consistent and acyclic; no guard‑rail may override another without explicit precedence edges. | Preserves deterministic governance. |

#### Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Long‑term integrity** – stops slow drift of the Core toward jargon, notation lock‑in, and hidden cycles. | Authors must run a guard‑rail checklist before submission. *Mitigation:* template auto‑inserts the checklist. |
| **Stable yet evolvable ecosystem** – Core stays timeless while Tooling & Pedagogy can iterate rapidly. | Early stage contributions may feel constrained; examples in the Pedagogical Companion show compliant paths. |
| **Trust & auditability** – stakeholders can verify the framework’s purity independently. | Adds overhead to governance; justified by safety and longevity. |

#### Rationale  
A constitution without enforcement degrades into *dead‑letter rules*.  
The four guard‑rails translate abstract Pillars into **concrete, testable
constraints**.  Grouping them under one umbrella pattern:

* gives newcomers a single “safety index” to consult,  
* makes compliance binary (*pass / amend*),  
* provides a stable anchor for future automated conformance tools—without
  mentioning any specific engine, thus honouring GR‑1 itself.

They collectively instantiate Pillars **P‑1**, **P‑2**, **P‑4**, **P‑5**
and reinforce the precedence order defined in **E.3**.

#### Relations

* **Comprises:**  
  * `pat:guard/devops‑firewall` (E.5.1) – GR‑1  
  * `pat:guard/notational‑independence` (E.5.2) – GR‑2  
  * `pat:guard/unidirectional‑dependency` (E.5.3) – GR‑3  
  * `pat:guard/bias‑audit` (E.5.4) – GR‑4
* **Depends on:**  
  * `pat:constitution/pillars` (E.2)  
  * `pat:constitution/principle‑taxonomy` (E.3)
* **Constrains:** every Core, Tooling, and Pedagogy artefact; all DRRs.

####  E.5.1 · DevOps Lexical Firewall \[D]

##### Context  
The FPF Core is meant to remain valid across decades and technology
generations.  Implementation details—file formats, build pipelines,
runtime flags—evolve rapidly and differ between domains.  When such
terms invade normative prose, the Core ages as quickly as the tools it
mentions.

##### Problem  
*Conceptual erosion*: a rule that cites a transient technology becomes
obsolete when that technology fades, forcing unnecessary Core revisions
and fragmenting historical audits.

##### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Timelessness** | Concepts must survive tool turnover. |
| **Pedagogic clarity** | Examples need concreteness ↔ too much concreteness hard‑codes technology. |
| **Cross‑domain reach** | Physical‑system engineers and knowledge‑theorists use different stacks. |

##### Solution  
Establish a **Lexical Firewall** around the Conceptual Core:

1. **Forbidden lexicon**  
   Normative patterns **SHALL NOT** contain tool‑or file‑specific words
   (e.g. protocol keywords, file extensions, IDE commands).  
   Permissible wording: “a reference parser”, “a serialisation schema”.

2. **Indirection rule**  
   When a Core concept needs an executable illustration, the pattern
   cites the **Tooling Reference family** artefact by *conceptual name*,
   never by concrete path or syntax.

3. **Glossary pointer**  
   If an unavoidable technical term appears, it is defined in a *Tooling
   Glossary* outside the Core and referenced by conceptual alias—not embedded.

##### Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Scenario | `U.System` example | `U.Episteme` example |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Normative text** | “A system boundary must expose at least one conserved‑quantity flow.” (No mention of modelling language.) | “An episteme records its F–G–R coordinates.” (No mention of proof syntax.) |
| **Illustrative link** | A modelling profile resides in the Tooling family; Core cites it as “the reference system‑profile”. | A linting routine lives in Tooling; Core cites it as “the reference episteme‑checker”. |

##### Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **CC‑LFW.1** | A Core pattern **SHALL** fail review if it contains implementation‑specific tokens. |
| **CC‑LFW.2** | References to executable artefacts **MUST** use conceptual names, not file paths or command strings. |
| **CC‑LFW.3** | Pedagogical examples inside Core **MAY** describe behaviour, but **MUST NOT** embed code snippets. |

##### Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Core stays evergreen and cross‑domain. | Authors must relocate concrete examples to Tooling or Pedagogy. |
| Reviewers can machine‑scan for banned tokens. | Requires a small vocabulary allow‑list; maintained in Tooling Guide. |

##### Rationale  
Language shapes thought.  By firewalling transient jargon, we uphold
**P‑1 Cognitive Elegance** (clarity), **P‑2 Didactic Primacy** (domain‑neutral
exposition) and **P‑5 Plug‑in Layering** (clean separation between Core
and Tooling).  The rule is content‑agnostic and thus itself immune to the
very decay it prevents.

##### Relations  
* **Parent umbrella:** `pat:constitution/guard‑rails` (E.5)  
* **Constrains:** every pattern in Conceptual Core  
* **Instantiates pillars:** P‑1, P‑2, P‑5
  
  ####  E.5.2 · Notational Independence \[D]

##### Context  
FPF concepts must travel across academic disciplines, modelling tools,
and future notations we cannot yet foresee. If a normative pattern binds
its *meaning* to one diagram style, file syntax, or markup dialect, the
concept ages as soon as the notation does.

##### Problem  
*Semantic lock‑in*: when a definition relies on a particular glyph set or
diagram grammar, alternative communities either translate it—risking
drift—or ignore FPF altogether.

##### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Expressiveness** | Diagrams and formal grammars aid precision ↔ they should never become the definition itself. |
| **Longevity** | A 20‑year horizon ↔ notation life‑cycles of 3‑5 years. |
| **Cross‑discipline adoption** | Mathematicians prefer algebraic syntax; engineers prefer schematics. |

##### Solution — Notational Independence Guard‑Rail  

1. **Semantics primacy**  
   Normative content **SHALL** define concepts in linguistic form first
   (plain English + mathematics if needed). Visual or syntax examples
   are secondary illustrations.

2. **Equivalence clause**  
   When an official alternate notation exists, the pattern must state:
   *“Representation A and Representation B are semantically equivalent
   under mapping M.”*

3. **Reference indirection**  
   If the Core cites a diagram, it does so by *conceptual role*
   (“reference boundary schematic”) rather than by file or syntax name.

4. **Conceptual prefix neutrality**  
   FPF **conceptual prefixes** (e.g., `U.`, `Γ_`, `ut:`, `tv:`, `ev:`, `mero:`) are  **cognitive namespaces**, not syntax tokens. Core patterns **MUST NOT**  tie their meaning to any concrete serialisation or URI scheme for these prefixes; any expansions are **illustrative only** and live in Tooling or Pedagogy.


##### Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Scenario | `U.System` example | `U.Episteme` example |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Definition | Boundary of a pump is expressed in prose plus set notation; a diagram is illustrative. | F‑G‑R characteristics defined textually; a triple‑store serialisation is illustrative. |
| Alternate rendering | Same pump semantics rendered in a lattice diagram or a tabular sheet remain valid. | R‑scores plotted in a heatmap or listed in CSV remain equivalent. |

##### Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **CC‑NI.1** | A Core pattern **MUST NOT** embed semantics that hinge on one specific notation. |
| **CC‑NI.2** | Illustrative renderings **SHALL** be marked “informative”. |
| **CC‑NI.3** | When multiple official renderings exist, the pattern **MUST** declare the semantic mapping between them. |
| **CC‑NI.4** | If a **conceptual prefix** appears in Core, its expansion (if shown) **SHALL** be marked *informative* and **MUST NOT** be required to interpret the semantics. |

##### Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Ensures FPF survives notation turnover. | Authors invest time describing mappings; mitigated by reusable mapping templates. |
| Lowers entry barrier for domains using different diagram traditions. | Excessive illustrations can bloat pages; guidance in Pedagogical Companion limits scope. |

##### Rationale  
Language and diagrams are tools, not truths. By elevating semantics over
syntax, FPF maintains **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance** and **P‑2 Didactic
Primacy** while safeguarding **P‑5 Plug‑in Layering**: tooling layers can
add new renderers without Core edits.

##### Relations  
* **Parent umbrella:** `pat:constitution/guard‑rails` (E.5)  
* **Constrains:** every normative Core pattern and official alternate rendering  
* **Instantiates pillars:** P‑1, P‑2, P‑5

####  E.5.3 · Unidirectional Dependency \[D]

##### Context  
FPF separates artefacts into stable **Conceptual Core**, executable
**Tooling Reference**, and fast‑evolving **Pedagogical Companion** (see
E.4 Artefact Architecture).  If dependencies can point *both* ways,
volatile layers will eventually drag the Core into rapid revision
cycles or introduce domain‑specific bias.

##### Problem  
*Architectural gravity*: a tutorial or helper script adds a new feature,
Core patterns import it “temporarily,” and within months the supposedly
timeless layer depends on transient assets—breaking Pillar **P‑5
Plug‑in Layering**.

##### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Agility vs Stability** | Tooling must iterate quickly ↔ Core must remain slow and deliberate. |
| **Reuse vs Isolation** | Authors want to reuse helper concepts ↔ Core cannot depend on volatile code. |
| **Simplicity** | Rule must be testable and unambiguous ↔ must allow legitimate upward imports. |

##### Solution — One‑Way, Acyclic Imports  
Define a strict **partial order** over artefact families:

Pedagogical Companion  ⟶  Tooling Reference  ⟶  Conceptual Core

1. **Allowed edges**  
   Dependencies **MAY** point **only upward** (toward greater semantic
   stability). No cycle is ever permitted.

2. **No downward import**  
   Core artefacts **SHALL NOT** import Tooling or Pedagogy artefacts.
   Tooling artefacts **SHALL NOT** import Pedagogy artefacts.

3. **Future layers**  
   Any new family is inserted below an existing one or becomes part of
   the Tooling or Pedagogy strata; the ordering extends accordingly.

##### Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Layer | `U.System` illustration | `U.Episteme` illustration |
|-------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Core | Definition of `U.System` and boundary invariant. | Definition of F‑G‑R characteristics. |
| Tooling | “Reference system‑profile” that checks boundary flow; *imports* Core invariants. | “Episteme‑scoring routine” that calculates R‑score; *imports* Core characteristics. |
| Pedagogy | Tutorial using the system‑profile to model a pump; *imports* profile and Core term. | Case study explaining R‑score evolution; *imports* scoring routine and Core term. |
| **Forbidden** | Core pattern importing measurement script. | Core pattern importing R‑score web dashboard. |

##### Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **CC‑UD.1** | Dependency graph among all artefacts **MUST** be acyclic. |
| **CC‑UD.2** | An artefact **SHALL** import only from its own family or any family above it in the order. |
| **CC‑UD.3** | A DRR that introduces a downward edge **SHALL** be automatically rejected. |

##### Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Core stays free of tool churn and tutorial bias. | Authors must create abstraction layers in Tooling instead of inserting hooks into Core. |
| Release cadence decoupled: Core (slow), Tooling (medium), Pedagogy (fast). | Slight duplication when multiple tools target same concept; mitigated by shared Core definitions. |

##### Rationale  
One‑way import graphs are a proven safeguard in operating systems
(kernel vs user land) and layered protocols. Here the rule operationalises
Pillars **P‑4 Open‑Ended Kernel** and **P‑5 Plug‑in Layering**, ensuring
that innovation happens “below” without contaminating the timeless Core.

##### Relations  
* **Parent umbrella:** `pat:constitution/guard‑rails` (E.5)  
* **References layer definition:** `pat:constitution/artefact‑architecture` (E.4)  
* **Instantiates pillars:** P‑4, P‑5  
* **Constrains:** All artefact imports recorded in DRRs or SCRs

#### E.5.4 — Cross‑Disciplinary Bias Audit** \[D]

##### Context  
FPF calls itself trans‑disciplinary, but every author carries implicit
metaphors from a home domain. If those metaphors leak into “universal”
patterns, practitioners from other fields disengage or mis‑interpret the
rules.

##### Problem  
Unrecognised bias hides in wording, examples, unit choices or principle
weighting. Once embedded in normative language, such bias is hard to
remove and contradicts Pillars **P‑2 Didactic Primacy** and **P‑8
Cross‑Scale Consistency**.

##### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Neutrality** | One voice for all disciplines ↔ need for relatable examples. |
| **Conciseness** | Audit guidance must be brief ↔ must cover multiple bias types. |
| **Longevity** | Guidance must survive emergence of new domains. |

##### Solution — Principle‑Taxonomy‑Guided Bias Audit  

1. **Bias‑Lens set**  
   Every normative pattern is assessed through **five lenses** that match the
   Principle classes from **E.3**:  
   `Gov`, `Arch`, `Onto/Epist`, `Prag`, `Did`.

2. **Equilibrium question**  
   For each lens ask:  
   *“Does the pattern over‑privilege this class or silence it?”*  
   *Examples:*  
   *   Over‑reliance on `Onto/Epist` precision may ignore `Prag` cost.  
   *   Dominant `Arch` metaphors may alienate `Did` audiences.

3. **Scope‑or‑Balance rule**  
   * If imbalance is found and universality is intended, re‑phrase to
     restore balance.  
   * If imbalance is intentional (domain‑specific pattern), mark the
     scope explicitly: *“Applies primarily to thermodynamic systems.”*

4. **Audit trace**  
   The pattern carries a short **Bias‑Annotation** paragraph recording
   which lenses were tested and any scoping statement. No workflow or
   reviewer metadata is stored in the Core.

##### Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Bias lens | Example imbalance | Conceptual correction |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------------|
| `Arch` vs `Did` | Pump pattern uses abstract category theory terms. | Add plain‑language boundary narrative or move abstraction to appendix. |
| `Onto/Epist` vs `Prag` | Episteme trust score defined with complex logic but no guidance on empirical cost. | Add pragmatic note on evidence collection burden or scope the pattern. |

##### Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| **CC‑BA.1** | Each Core pattern **SHALL** include a *Bias‑Annotation* listing the five lenses and any declared scope limitation. | Ensures explicit reflection on bias. |
| **CC‑BA.2** | A pattern labelled “universal” **MUST NOT** privilege a single lens without justification or scoping note. | Preserves trans‑disciplinary integrity. |
| **CC‑BA.3** | If scope is declared, the pattern **SHALL** reference the mapping or rationale that enables cross‑domain translation. | Keeps pathways open for other calculi. |

##### Consequences  

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Neutral, inclusive language attracts wider adoption. | Authors spend a few extra lines on Bias‑Annotation; mitigated by template snippet. |
| Bias is surfaced at writing time, not after publication. | — |

##### Rationale  
Coupling the audit directly to the Principle Taxonomy keeps the guard‑rail
**concept‑driven**, not workflow‑driven. No mention of review boards,
CI‑jobs, or checklists appears in the Core; such mechanics belong in the
Tooling Guide. This guard‑rail therefore satisfies **GR‑1** (Firewall)
while securing Pillars **P‑2, P‑7 Pragmatic Utility, P‑8**.

##### Relations  
* **Parent umbrella:** `pat:constitution/guard‑rails` (E.5)  
* **Depends on:** `pat:constitution/principle‑taxonomy` (E.3)  
* **Constrains:** All normative patterns claiming universality
  
### E.6 · Didactic Architecture of the Specification \[D]

#### Context  
FPF addresses readers from at least two characteristics of diversity:

* **Disciplinary** – systems engineers, knowledge scientists, ethicists.  
* **Experience** – newcomers need intuition; experts need rigour.

Past drafts mixed governance mandates with domain examples, producing a
steep learning curve and repeated “forward‑reference” detours.

#### Problem  
If core ideas are buried under formalism or scattered across parts,
readers either give up or misuse the framework. We need a **fixed
narrative scaffold** that guides cognitive load from low to high while
keeping normative sections discoverable.

#### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Cognitive Load** | Early clarity ↔ eventual formal depth. |
| **Conceptual Integrity** | Foregoing examples risks abstraction ↔ too many examples delay axioms. |
| **Uniform Flow** | Single, predictable roadmap ↔ flexibility for future parts. |

#### Solution — “On‑Ramp to Archetypes first, Authoring last” sequence  

The "On-Ramp First" Macro-Structure: The specification is ordered to create a smooth cognitive ramp:
* It begins with an informal, non-normative Preface (The On-Ramp), which uses storytelling and concrete examples (System and Episteme) to build intuition.
* It then proceeds through the normative Parts (A-D), moving from the foundational kernel to the rich patterns of trans-disciplinary reasoning.
* It concludes with the authoring rules (Part E) and appendices, ensuring that this "meta" content does not obstruct the primary learning path.

1. **Preface (On‑Ramp)**  
   Informal tour; introduces `U.System` and `U.Episteme` via concrete
   stories before any normative language appears.

2. **Part A Kernel**  
   Minimal holonic ontology and the Transformer principle give readers
   the essential vocabulary.

3. **Part B Trans‑disciplinary Reasoning**  
   Tell‑Show‑Show pedagogy: universal rule → Sys‑CAL example →

#### Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Narrative layer | First sight of `U.System` | First sight of `U.Episteme` |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Preface | Coffee‑machine story (pump as system). | Meta‑analysis story (study bundle as episteme). |
| Part A | Formal definition inherits boundary invariant. | Formal definition inherits F‑G‑R coordinates. |
| Part B Tell‑Show‑Show | Γ\_sys example: assemble pump. | Γ_epist example: merge study bundle. |

#### Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **CC‑DA.1** | Each Part **SHALL** open with a one‑paragraph situational “hook” before formal text. |
| **CC‑DA.2** | Every `[A]` pattern **MUST** implement Tell‑Show‑Show: universal rule plus System & Episteme illustrations. |
| **CC‑DA.3** | Governance patterns (**Part E**) **SHALL NOT** appear before the Kernel in the main document flow. |

#### Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Smooth learning curve; readers can stop at their needed depth. | Template discipline required; mitigated by authoring guide (E.8). |
| Reduces forward‑reference clutter; each concept is primed before formal use. | Preface evolves when new archetypes added; handled via On‑Ramp revision DRR. |

#### Rationale  
Educational research shows retention improves when abstract rules are
immediately paired with contrasting illustrations. By fixing the reading
order and mandating Tell‑Show‑Show inside every `[A]` pattern, FPF
embeds pedagogy into its architecture, realising Pillars **P‑2 Didactic
Primacy** and **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance** without weakening rigour.

#### Relations  
* **Depends on:** `pat:constitution/guard‑rails` (GR‑1 ensures example jargon stays outside Core).  
* **Constrains:** Placement of all Parts, patterns, and appendices.  
* **Instantiates pillars:** P‑1, P‑2
  
###  E.7 · Archetypal Grounding Principle \[D]

#### Context  
Universal rules are powerful only when readers can grasp them. In FPF the
Conceptual Core speaks in substrate‑agnostic language: `U.Holon`,
Γ‑aggregation, MHT emergence. Practitioners need to “see” those rules in
familiar matter—physical hardware or bodies of knowledge—before they can
reuse them.

#### Problem  
A purely abstract statement risks two failures:

1. **Didactic failure** – readers dismiss the pattern as “too meta,”
   violating Pillar **P‑2 Didactic Primacy**.  
2. **Unproven universality** – without cross‑domain instantiation the rule
   remains an untested claim.

#### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Universality vs Concreteness** | Abstract law ↔ concrete example. |
| **Brevity vs Clarity** | Spec should stay concise ↔ dual examples add length. |
| **Rigour vs Accessibility** | Formal semantics ↔ intuitive narrative. |

#### Solution — mandatory *Archetypal Grounding* subsection  

Every architectural pattern (`[A]`) **SHALL** include a dedicated
section, titled exactly **“Archetypal Grounding,”** that *shows* how the
abstract law SCRs in FPF’s two canonical holon flavours:

1. **`U.System`** – the archetype of a **physical, operational holon**.  
2. **`U.Episteme`** – the archetype of an **abstract, epistemic holon**.

This enforces a repeatable **Tell‑Show‑Show** rhythm:

| Stage | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Tell** | `Solution` section states the universal rule. |
| **Show #1** | `Archetypal Grounding` – concrete `U.System` example. |
| **Show #2** | Same section – parallel `U.Episteme` example. |

#### Archetypal Grounding (of this pattern itself)

| Universal rule | `U.System` instantiation | `U.Episteme` instantiation |
|----------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| “Every `[A]` pattern requires grounding.” | Pattern *D.1 Algebra of Aggregation* illustrates Γ\_sys on assembling a water pump. | The same pattern illustrates Γ_epist on merging a meta‑analysis. |

#### Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| **CC‑AG.1** | Every architectural (`[A]`) pattern in Parts A, B, C, D, E **SHALL** contain a subsection headed exactly *“Archetypal Grounding”*. | Guarantees consistent Tell‑Show‑Show rhythm. |
| **CC‑AG.2** | The Archetypal Grounding subsection **MUST** illustrate the rule with both `U.System` *and* `U.Episteme`. | Demonstrates trans‑disciplinary reach. |
| **CC‑AG.3** | If a rule intentionally applies to only one substrate, the subsection **SHALL** state the scope limitation and justify it against the five Principle‑Taxonomy lenses (`Gov`, `Arch`, `Onto/Epist`, `Prag`, `Did`). | Prevents silent bias; links to Bias‑Audit guard‑rail. |
| **CC‑AG.4** | Patterns lacking a compliant Archetypal Grounding subsection **MAY NOT** progress to “Accepted” status. | Enforces discipline without referring to workflow mechanics. |

#### Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Immediate clarity** – readers see abstract laws in action. | Patterns grow by one short table; mitigated by consistent template snippet. |
| **Proof of universality** – every rule is self‑documenting across substrates. | Authors must think cross‑domain; fosters richer patterns. |
| **Narrative cohesion** – recurring System/Episteme protagonists create a memorable storyline. | — |
|Built-in Proof of Universality: The specification consistently demonstrates its trans-disciplinary claims, building trust and credibility. | — |

#### Rationale  
Tell‑Show‑Show is a proven pedagogical sequence. By making it normative,
FPF hard‑codes **P‑2 Didactic Primacy** into the fabric of every `[A]`
pattern while still honouring **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance**—the grounding
section replaces brittle ad‑hoc anecdotes with a disciplined dual
example. Linking scope‑justification to the five Principle lenses ties the
pattern to the **Taxonomy‑Guided Bias Audit** and keeps governance
language out of the Core.

#### Relations  

* **Implements macro flow:** `pat:authoring/didactic‑architecture` (E.6)  
* **References base types:** `pat:kernel/holon` (A.1) (`U.System`, `U.Episteme`)  
* **Interacts with bias guard‑rail:** `pat:guard/bias‑audit` (E.5.4) via CC‑AG.3  
* **Constrains:** Authoring template in `pat:authoring/pattern‑template` (E.8)

###  E.8 · FPF Authoring Conventions & Style Guide   \[A]

#### Context  
FPF grows through the addition of patterns written by authors from many
disciplines.  Without a shared structure *and* voice the framework would
fracture, violating Pillars **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance** and
**P‑2 Didactic Primacy**.

#### Problem  
*Structural drift* and *stylistic fragmentation* threaten three qualities:

1. **Comparability** – readers cannot align patterns lacking common
   headings.  
2. **Narrative cohesion** – prose swings from dry jargon to informal
   blog style.  
3. **Auditability** – missing sections hide safety checks
   (Archetypal Grounding, Bias‑Annotation).

#### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Uniformity vs Expressiveness** | Consistent template ↔ freedom for diverse domains. |
| **Rigor vs Readability** | Formal precision ↔ engaging prose. |
| **Brevity vs Completeness** | Concise patterns ↔ mandated safety subsections. |

#### Solution — One template, enriched by style principles

##### 2 · Stylistic Principles (S‑0 … S‑11)

| # | Principle | Guideline |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| S‑0 | Narrative Seven-Step Heuristic | Authors are encouraged to structure major paragraphs or subsections using the seven‑step mnemonic |
| S‑1 | Density without Jargon | Short declarative sentences; tool names belong in Pedagogy/Tooling. |
| S‑2 | Internal Cohesion | Inline references to Pillars and related patterns. |
| S‑3 | Embedded Mini‑Definitions | Gloss a new term in parentheses on first appearance. |
| S‑4 | Contextualisation | Brief historical or disciplinary lineage anchors. |
| S‑5 | Prophylactic Clarification | Pre‑empt common misreadings inside the prose. |
| S‑6 | Quotable Closers | Finish Solution or Consequences with a memorable aphorism. |
| S‑7 | Generative over Prescriptive | Present rules as enabling constraints, not bureaucracy. |
| S‑8 | Trans‑disciplinary Tie‑ins | Illustrate using at least two distinct fields. |
| S‑9 | Physical Grounding Anchor | Link abstractions to a `Transformer` or physical process. |
| S‑10 | Punchy Blocks | ≤ 5 sentences per paragraph; lists for clarity. |
| S‑11 | Narrative Flow | Ensure sections read as a continuous story, not bullet soup. |

Authors use the principles as a *scaffold*, not a straitjacket: the goal
is coherent, engaging insight.

** S-0 (Narrative Flow Heuristic) explanation**
Narrative flow recommended follow these steps: **Hook → Frame → Weave → Anchor → Bridge → Flow → Close**.

Brief explanations: 
| Step       | Purpose in a paragraph/section                             |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hook**   | Grab attention with a vivid image or paradox.              |
| **Frame**  | State the specific question or problem space.              |
| **Weave**  | Connect to earlier patterns or Pillars.                    |
| **Anchor** | Tie to a concrete System/Episteme or physical process.     |
| **Bridge** | Show the implication for the upcoming claim or rule.       |
| **Flow**   | Deliver the formal content or argument.                    |
| **Close**  | End with a quotable line or payoff that reinforces memory. |

Narrative Flow Heuristic also operationalises S‑1 (Density w/o Jargon), S‑2 (Internal Cohesion), S‑4 (Contextualisation), and S‑6 (Quotable Closers).

#### Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Template element | `U.System` illustration | `U.Episteme` illustration |
|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Section order | Pump‑assembly pattern follows 1‑to‑11 headings. | Meta‑analysis pattern follows same headings. |
| S‑1 Density w/o Jargon | “The pump boundary is the sealing plane.” | “An episteme’s F‑score captures falsifiability.” |
| Hook‑Weave‑Anchor | Opens with field anecdote → links Γ‑core → anchors to motor torque. | Opens with historical paradox → links MHT → anchors to peer‑review data. |

##### Conformance Checklist  

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| **CC‑SG.1** | Every new pattern **SHALL** follow the section order defined in the Canonical Template (Context → … → Relations). | Guarantees structural comparability and machine‑parsing. |
| **CC‑SG.2** | Architectural patterns (`[A]`) **MUST** include an *Archetypal Grounding* section; Definitional patterns (`[D]`) **MAY** omit it **only** if the Bias‑Annotation states a domain‑specific scope. | Enforces Tell‑Show‑Show unless formally limited. |
| **CC‑SG.3** | The *Bias‑Annotation* section **SHALL** cite the five Principle‑Taxonomy lenses and declare either “Universal” or an explicit scope limitation. | Keeps cross‑disciplinary neutrality explicit (ties to Guard‑Rail 4). |
| **CC‑SG.4** | Normative sentences **MUST** use keywords *SHALL*, *SHALL NOT*, *MUST*, *MAY* exactly as defined; synonyms are prohibited. | Prevents ambiguity for auditors and tooling. |
| **CC‑SG.5** | Pattern prose **SHOULD** demonstrate adherence to Style Principles **S‑0 … S‑11**; reviewers are empowered to request revision when clarity or didactic quality suffers. | Embeds common narrative voice without rigid policing. |

##### Consequences  

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Predictable skeleton** – readers instantly know where to find context, forces, and criteria. | Limits author freedom in macro layout; mitigated by flexibility inside the Solution subsection. |
| **Cohesive voice** – S‑principles give FPF a recognisable style, aiding memorability. | Reviewers must read for style, not only semantics; checklists ease load. |
| **Embedded pedagogy** – Tell‑Show‑Show and Hook → Close heuristics turn the spec into a self‑teaching text. | Slightly longer patterns; justified by better comprehension and fewer clarifying DRRs. |

##### Rationale  
Structure and style function as FPF’s *grammar*. By unifying what were
once separate “template” and “style guide” patterns, authors face a
single reference point that satisfies:

* **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance** – uniform, minimal surprises.  
* **P‑2 Didactic Primacy** – narrative flow, dual archetype examples.  
* Guard‑Rails 1 & 2 – no tool jargon, no notation lock‑in inside prose.

Optionality for `[D]` patterns preserves efficiency: purely invariant
definitions need not carry dual examples, yet must still justify the
omission via Bias‑Annotation—keeping pedagogy and neutrality explicit.

Conformance checklist often has name conformance criteria in international and industry standards, FPF name it so to easier adopt by engineers and managers.

##### Relations  

* **Implements:** `pat:authoring/didactic‑architecture` (E 6) & `pat:authoring/archetypal‑grounding` (E 7)  
* **Constrained by:** Guard‑Rails E 5.1‑E 5.4 (lexical firewall, notation independence, etc.)  
* **Constrains:** All future `NORM`, `A`, `D`, and `GOV` patterns; DRR template references the same section order.  

###  E.9 · Design‑Rationale Record (DRR) Method \[D]

#### Context  
FPF is engineered for Pillar **P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution**: its normative
rules must adapt as new calculi and insights arrive. But change without a
record of *why* leads to conceptual erosion and undermines auditability.
Hence FPF requires an explicit **Design‑Rationale Record (DRR)**—a
durable *conceptual artefact* that precedes every normative change.

#### Problem  
Direct edits to the Core, absent a structured rationale, trigger three
systemic hazards:

1. **Lost provenance** – future authors cannot infer the reasoning behind
   a rule; intent decays.  
2. **Implicit assumptions** – discarded alternatives vanish from memory,
   so debates resurface and churn repeats.  
3. **Conceptual drift** – incremental tweaks slip past the Eleven Pillars
   and Principle Taxonomy lenses, blurring the framework’s foundations.

#### Forces  

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Agility vs Rigour** | Evolve swiftly ↔ demonstrate deliberate, Pillar‑aligned decisions. |
| **Transparency vs Efficiency** | Provide a public argument trail ↔ avoid bureaucratic drag on minor edits. |
| **Clarity vs Conciseness** | Capture full reasoning ↔ prevent meta‑text from bloating the Core itself. |

#### Solution — the DRR as a structured argument  
Any proposal to add, modify or deprecate a `NORM`, `A`, `D`, or `GOV`
rule **MUST** be accompanied by a **Design‑Rationale Record** containing
exactly four conceptual components:

| Component | Guiding question | Typical content |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Context** | *Why are we talking about this?* | Problem statement, triggering insight, or external change. |
| **Decision** | *What will we do?* | Precise normative text to enter the specification. |
| **Rationale** | *Why is this the right thing?* | Comparison of alternatives, Pillar check, taxonomy‑lens balance. |
| **Consequences** | *What happens next?* | Expected benefits, trade‑offs, impacted patterns, risk notes. |

The DRR lives **outside** the normative Core; only its *Decision* flows
into the specification upon acceptance, preserving Core brevity while
storing provenance.

#### Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Holon flavour | DRR analogue | Four components illustrated |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| **`U.System`** (physical) | Engineering Change Order for pump motor upgrade. | Context: inefficiency; Decision: switch to brushless DC; Rationale: energy gain vs cost; Consequences: new control schema + supplier change. |
| **`U.Episteme`** (knowledge) | Foundational theory revision paper. | Context: conflicting data; Decision: introduce new axiom; Rationale: explains legacy & new data, Pillar alignment; Consequences: fresh predictions, update to curricula. |

#### Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| **CC‑DRR.1** | Any change to a `NORM`, `A`, `D`, or `GOV` pattern **SHALL** be preceded by an accepted DRR containing Context, Decision, Rationale, Consequences. | Prevents undocumented edits. |
| **CC‑DRR.2** | The *Rationale* element **MUST** assess the proposal against **all Eleven Pillars** and the five Principle‑Taxonomy lenses (`Gov`, `Arch`, `Onto/Epist`, `Prag`, `Did`). | Keeps evolution aligned and cross‑disciplinary. |
| **CC‑DRR.3** | The DRR **SHALL** list every pattern it supersedes, amends, or risks impacting. | Maintains explicit impact graph. |
| **CC‑DRR.4** | Once approved, only the *Decision* text is inserted into the Core; other DRR sections **SHALL NOT** migrate into normative prose. | Preserves Core brevity; provenance remains external. |
| **CC‑DRR.5** | Minor, non‑substantive edits (e.g., typos) **MAY** follow a lightweight DRR variant containing Context + Decision only, provided they do not alter semantics. | Allows efficiency without eroding rigour. |

#### Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Complete audit trail** – every normative change carries a structured “why”. | Adds deliberate friction; mitigated by CC‑DRR.5 for trivial fixes. |
| **Higher decision quality** – Pillar & lens check surfaces hidden conflicts early. | Authors must learn taxonomy; template checklist shortens ramp‑up. |
| **Institutional memory** – prevents re‑litigation of rejected alternatives. | DRR archive grows; index stored in a non‑normative annex. |

#### Rationale  
A legal code evolves by amendments, not by editing the statute in place;
FPF adopts the same discipline. The DRR embodies **P‑10 Open‑Ended
Evolution** while protecting **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance**: the Core remains
succinct, yet its evolution is fully transparent. Coupling the argument
to the Pillars and taxonomy lenses aligns each change with FPF’s
constitution and Guard‑Rails, without prescribing tooling workflows.

#### Relations  

* **Instantiates:** P‑10 Open‑Ended Evolution, P‑2 Didactic Primacy  
* **Template governed by:** `pat:authoring/pattern‑template` (E 8)  
* **Interacts with:** `pat:guard/bias‑audit` (E 5.4) via lens check  
* **Complemented by:** `pat:authoring/code‑of‑conduct` (E 12) – etiquette for DRR debate  

# E.10 — *LEX‑BUNDLE*: Unified Lexical Rules for FPF (Registers, Naming, and Forbidden Forms)**
*Definitional pattern \[D]; normative for all Core/Architheory text and for any Context that claims FPF conformance.*

**Status & placement.** Part E.10 (“Lexical Discipline & Stratification”); complements **E.10.D1 (D.CTX)** and **E.10.D2 (I/D/S)** and is referenced by F‑cluster naming practices (F.4–F.8). This bundle consolidates all lexical constraints in one place so authors can cite **“LEX‑BUNDLE”** instead of listing rules scattered across documents.

**Builds on:** A.7 **Strict Distinction (Clarity Lattice)**; E.5 Guard‑Rails (DevOps Lexical Firewall; Notational Independence; Unidirectional Dependency); F.5 **Naming Discipline for U.Types & Roles**.
**Coordinates with.** A.2/A.15 (Role–Method–Work alignment), A.10 (Evidence Anchoring), B.1/B.3 (Γ‑algebras & assurance), F‑cluster (context of meaning; Bridges).

---

## 1 · Intent & Scope (what this bundle guarantees)

**Intent.** Provide one **normative** rule‑set that makes FPF language **unambiguous, composable across contexts, and teachable** by design. Authors, reviewers, and tooling can point to **LEX‑BUNDLE** as the single source of truth for:

* **Vertical stratification** (Kernel ↔ Architheory ↔ Context ↔ Instance);
* **Twin registers** (Tech/Plain) with safe synonyms;
* **Naming morphology** (allowed suffixes & style) for the kernel’s core objects;
* **Minimal Generality** tests (names are neither parochial nor vacuous);
* **Canonical rewrites** for overloaded words (e.g., *process*, *function*, *service*);
* **Conformance checks** (lintable) and minimal examples.

**Scope.** Applies to:
(a) **Core** (Parts A–G), (b) **Architheory specs** (CAL/LOG/CHR), (c) **Context glossaries** that claim FPF conformity, and (d) **Diagrams/prose** in normative text. It **does not** constrain Tooling or Pedagogy wording other than where they quote Core semantics.

---

## 2 · Problem (recurring lexical failure‑modes)

1. **Polysemy drift.** *Process, function, service, agent, activity* slide between structure, recipe, execution, and promise.
2. **Cross‑context collision.** A label (e.g., *Owner*) is assumed “global” though meanings differ per `U.BoundedContext`.
3. **Name bloat vs. parochialism.** Either hyper‑specific domain names leak into core types, or vague umbrella names obscure invariants.
4. **I/D/S collapse.** Authors mix **intension** (the thing), **description** (how we describe it), and **specification** (testable criteria).
5. **Register soup.** Tech terms bleed into Plain pedagogy and vice‑versa, inviting category errors.

---

## 3 · Forces

| Force                          | Tension to resolve                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Universality vs. local fit** | Kernel must stay universal while allowing domain nuance in a Context of meaning.              |
| **Brevity vs. clarity**        | Short names help, but only if morphology signals the right kernel slot.                    |
| **Stability vs. evolution**    | Names should survive refactors; yet we must accommodate new roles/types without explosion. |
| **Pedagogy vs. precision**     | Plain words aid learners; Tech labels anchor formal checks.                                |

---

## 4 · Solution — the **LEX‑BUNDLE** rule‑set (overview)

**LEX‑BUNDLE** aka **URL (unified lexical rules)** is a compact set of **register, naming, and rewrite** rules with conformance checks. It consists of:

1. **Vertical Stratification Ladder** (E.10 → four strata);
2. **Twin‑Register Discipline** (Tech/Plain pairs);
3. **Minimal Generality (MG)** principle + tests;
4. **Morphology & Style** (suffixes, casing, reserved prefixes);
5. **Canonical Rewrites** for overloaded words (L‑rules);
6. **Conformance Checklist (CC‑LEX)** and **Regression Stubs (RSCR‑LEX)**.

Below are the **normative clauses** 

---

## 5 · Vertical Stratification Ladder (four strata; no cross‑bleed)

> **Rule V‑0 (Strata).** Every lexical item in a conformant text belongs to exactly one **stratum**:

1. **Kernel** — `U.*` types, kernel relations, invariants (e.g., `U.Holon`, `U.Role`, `U.Method`, `U.Work`, `U.Service`).
2. **Architheory** — CAL/LOG/CHR exports (e.g., **Sys‑CAL**, **KD‑CAL**, **Agency‑CHR**) that **extend** but do not override Kernel.
3. **Context** — a **`U.BoundedContext`** with its **Glossary, Invariants, Roles**, and **Bridges** (local Context of meaning).
4. **Instance** — concrete identifiers (holders, role assignments, works, carriers).

**V‑1 (Unidirectional meaning).** Meaning **flows downward** only: Kernel → Architheory → Context → Instance. No stratum may redefine a higher stratum’s term; it may only **specialise** or **bridge** it.

**V‑2 (Citation style).** When a Context term is used, its **Context** must be visible at first mention (e.g., `OwnerRole:ITIL_2020`). If an author needs Cross‑context reuse, they **MUST** cite a **Bridge** with a stated **Congruence Level (CL)** (see F.9).

**V‑3 (Firewall).** Tooling/Pedagogy idioms shall not leak into Kernel prose (DevOps Lexical Firewall). CI/CD jargon, file formats, or API names **MUST NOT** appear in Core definitions. (Pedagogy may use them **as examples** only.)

---

## 6 · Twin‑Register Discipline (Tech / Plain)

> **Rule R‑0 (Registers).** Every Kernel and Architheory concept has a **Tech label** (the testable semantic token) and an optional **Plain label** (didactic synonym). The **Tech label is authoritative**; the Plain label is permitted *only* in expository text and must map 1:1 to the Tech meaning inside the current **Context**.

### 6.1 Allowed pairs (normative table; examples)

| **Tech (authoritative)** | **Plain (didactic)**                        | **Notes & guards**                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `U.System`               | system, machine, team, service‑instance     | “Service” **never** stands for `U.System`; reserve **Service** for `U.Service` (see L‑SERV). |
| `U.Episteme`             | body of knowledge, document, dataset, model | Pair must respect **Carrier vs Content** (A.7).                                              |
| `U.Method`               | how‑to, procedure (abstract)                | Do **not** call this “process” (L‑PROC).                                                     |
| `U.MethodDescription`    | recipe, SOP, playbook, code, spec‑text      | If testable, call out **Spec** explicitly per E.10.D2 (I/D/S).                               |
| `U.Work`                 | run, execution, activity, job, case         | Never use “process” or “procedure” here.                                                     |
| `U.Role`                 | role, hat, mask                             | Always **context‑indexed** per D.CTX.                                                        |
| `U.Service`              | promise, offering, external contract        | Never equate to provider system or API (L‑SERV).                                             |
| `U.Capability`           | ability, capacity (within bounds)           | Separate from Role/Method/Work; must carry **envelope & measures**.                          |
| `U.Dynamics`             | law of change, model of evolution           | Not a capability or a method.                                                                |

**R‑1 (Plain first‑use).** At first use in a section, show **Tech label** and (if you want) the Plain synonym: *“…a `U.Method` (the **how‑to**), described by a `U.MethodDescription` (the **recipe**) …”*
**R‑2 (No unpaired Plain in CC).** Conformance Checklists must use **Tech labels** only.

Domains can mint aliases inside their `U.BoundedContext` glossary; all aliases must map 1:1 to a Tech label (**SenseCell** row in the Context’s **Concept-Set Table**), and if exported across Contexts, via an **Alignment Bridge** (with **CL/Loss**).

## 7 · Minimal Generality & Domain Anchoring (MG·DA) — names neither parochial nor vacuous

> **Principle (MG·DA).** A minted name is **as general as necessary and no more**, and its **head noun is anchored to the object‑of‑talk**. First classify the **NameToken (name of a concept: term, lexical unit) itself** using **`LEX.TokenClass`**, then apply the guardrails corresponding to that class: kernel tokens must unify **across domains**; discriminator/context tokens must make the **domain legible** *from the name itself*.

### 7.1 `LEX.TokenClass` (meta‑lexical; not a USM Scope)
**Definition.** `LEX.TokenClass : NameToken → {KernelToken | ContextToken | DiscriminatorToken}`.  
This is a **Characteristic on NameTokens** (symbols), used by the LEX registry and MG·DA lints.
It is **not** a USM scope and carries **no** truth/validity semantics.

### 7.2 `KernelToken` — Minimal Generality (MG‑K)
**MG‑K1 (Tri‑domain witness, MUST).** Maintain a DRR/Glossary note with **≥ 3 heterogeneous arenas** where the invariants hold (e.g., manufacturing, healthcare, cloud ops). If you cannot, narrow to a Context name or move qualifiers into **RCS** (Role Characterisation Space).
**MG‑K2 (No parochial nouns, MUST).** Kernel names **MUST NOT** contain domain nouns (*Ticket, Microservice, Patient, Developer*). Such nouns belong in **Context** or as **RCS Characteristics**.
**MG‑K3 (No vacuity, MUST).** Avoid vacuous heads (*Thing, Event, Process, Resource*). Use existing kernel heads (`U.Holon`, `U.Work`, `U.Method`, `U.Resrc`, …).
**MG‑K4 (Intent over mechanism, MUST).** Kernel type/role names encode **intent**, not mechanism. Mechanisms (algorithms, hardware form, recipe flavors) live in **RCS** or **Capability**.
**MG‑K5 (Notation independence, SHOULD).** The intensional meaning is separable from any one notation/toolchain.
**MG‑K6 (Refactoring safety, MUST).** If a name fails MG, do **not** mutate it silently. Record a DRR and apply F.13 **Lexical Continuity & Deprecation** (aliases; Bridges for Cross‑context mappings).

### 7.3 `DiscriminatorToken` / `ContextToken` — Domain Anchoring (DA‑D)
**DA‑D1 (Object‑of‑talk anchoring, MUST).** The head noun names the **object being classified** (e.g., *Sense*, *Context*, *Role*, *Bridge*, *Characteristic*). Readers can answer “**X of what?**” without external context.
**DA‑D2 (Characteristic, not axis, MUST).** Enumerated properties are named as **Characteristic**  within a **CharacteristicSpace** (MM‑CAL). Avoid spatial metaphors (*axis, dimension, plane, lane, tier, layer*) unless the metaphor is a **pattern‑defined primitive** in this spec.
**DA‑D3 (Enum clarity, MUST).** If the term denotes an enumeration, (a) the value set is **small and closed**, (b) membership criteria are obvious from the definition, (c) the **object‑of‑talk** is explicit in the name (e.g., `SenseFamily`, not bare *Family*, *RowPlane* or overly general *Facet*).
**DA‑D4 (Anti‑recipe, MUST).** Do not bake *how‑to* or local methods into discriminator names; those belong in `U.Method/MethodDescription` or **Capability**.
**DA‑D5 (Mapping discipline, MUST).** Cross‑context readings go through a **Bridge** (F.9). Discriminator names must not suggest global identity.
**DA‑D6 (Register discipline, SHOULD).** Keep normative tokens stable; synonyms live in **Plain** register only and must not appear in constraints/tests.
**DA‑D7 (Ban generic combinators, MUST).** Reject vague composites like *NameUseMode*, *NamingScope*, *RowFacet/RowPlane/RowLane*. Each candidate must pass **DA‑D1** and **DA‑D3** (object‑anchored head and explicit **CharacteristicSpace**).

### 7.4 Global tests (apply after 7.2/7.3)
**MG·DA‑T1 (Three‑arena witness).** If **`LEX.TokenClass`(t)=KernelToken**, you **MUST** provide the tri‑domain witnesses (7.2‑MG‑K1). Otherwise this is **SHOULD** (document at least one contrasting arena).
**MG·DA‑T2 (Object‑of‑talk).** The head noun uniquely signals the subject area; avoid free‑floating metaphors. **MG·DA‑T3 (Anti‑recipe).** Remove mechanism/implementation words; relocate to Method/Capability/RCS.
**MG·DA‑T4 (Enum clarity).** For enumerations, list the closed value set and its CharacteristicSpace.
**MG·DA‑T5 (Collision & Uniqueness, MUST).** Before merge, run a **full‑text search** over the corpus and the **Reserved‑Names registry**. The candidate **MUST NOT** collide with any existing token used in another sense anywhere in FPF. If a collision exists, either rename or raise a DRR to deprecate the prior token.
**MG·DA‑T6 (Teaching swap).** In didactic prose (E.10.D2 §17), the term can be swapped in **without caveats**. 
**MG·DA‑T7 (Intensional ground, MUST).** The definition card states the intensional criterion for membership explicitly; reviewers can check membership without reading external narrative.

### 7.5 Compatibility with USM (how tokens and scopes meet)
**USM applies to acts, not tokens.** Mint/rename/use are **LexicalActs** that carry a USM scope. `LEX.TokenClass` constrains **where** a token may be used via an **AllowedScopes** policy:
**Conformance rule.** For any usage `u` of a token `t`: `LEX.TokenClass(t)=c  ⇒  USM.Scope(u) ∈ AllowedScopes(c).`

The LEX registry defines `AllowedScopes(c)` (e.g., `KernelToken` usage in normative kernel constraints is allowed; in Plain register outside a glossary is restricted; Context emissions of `KernelToken` require a Bridge/alias, etc.).

**Audit.** Violations are flagged as **SCR‑LEX‑Sxx** (see acceptance tests below).

### 7.6 Metaphor guidance (non‑binding heuristics)
Prefer **object‑anchored heads** to metaphors. If a metaphor is unavoidable, ensure it is (a) explicitly defined by a pattern here, and (b) unambiguous within the **NameClass**. Example families (use sparingly):
* **Progression metaphors** (*level, tier, ladder*): only where a **gate/upgrade** is defined by the pattern.  
* **Separation metaphors** (*lane, track*): only where parallel, non‑interfering flows are enforced by rules.  
* **Grouping metaphors** (*family, class*): only for **small, closed enumerations** attached to a clearly named object‑of‑talk (e.g., `SenseFamily` rather than bare *Family*).

### 7.7 Short‑form and acronym discipline
**SF‑1 (First expansion, MUST).** On first use, expand the term; place the short‑form in parentheses (e.g., “Minimal Generality & Domain Anchoring (**MG·DA**)”).  
**SF‑2 (Uniqueness, MUST).** Register short‑forms in the **Reserved‑Names** list; run the collision check (7.4‑MG·DA‑T5).  
**SF‑3 (Form, SHOULD).** Prefer typographic separators (**MG·DA**) to fused acronyms (**MGDA**). Use the fused form only in code or identifiers where punctuation is disallowed, and only after registration.

### 7.8 Examples (illustrative, not exhaustive)
Prefer **`U.Service`** (promise) over *BusinessService*; **`U.Capability`** over *Function*; **`U.Dynamics`** over *NaturalProcess*; **`U.WorkPlan`** over *ScheduleProcess*.  
Do **not** mint *ETLService* at kernel level—model ETL as `MethodDescription`; the **Service** is “data delivered under acceptance.”

### 7.9 Acceptance & regression checks (LEX/USM)
**SCR‑LEX‑S01 (TokenClass declaration).** Every normative token has a declared `LEX.TokenClass`.
**SCR‑LEX‑S02 (Collision & uniqueness).** Full‑text + Reserved‑Names check passes (no other meaning in FPF).
**SCR‑LEX‑S03 (Object‑of‑talk anchoring).** Heads name the object classified (DA‑D1).
**SCR‑LEX‑S04 (CharacteristicSpace).** Enumerations declare their value set and space (DA‑D2/3).
**SCR‑LEX‑S05 (USM compatibility).** For each LexicalAct, `USM.Scope ∈ AllowedScopes(LEX.TokenClass)`.
**RSCR‑LEX‑E01 (Banned generics).** Reject tokens matching the banned combinators list (DA‑D7).
**RSCR‑LEX‑E02 (Metaphor hygiene).** If a metaphor is used, show the pattern that defines it; otherwise rename.

## 8 · Morphology & Lexical Form (LEX.Morph)

> **Principle.** Form follows **object‑of‑talk**. A token’s morphology (suffix/prefix/casing) must (a) express **what kind of thing** it names, (b) respect **MG·DA** (Minimal Generality & Domain Anchoring), and (c) pass **LEX.TokenClass** gates:
> `LEX.TokenClass(token) ∈ {KernelToken | ContextToken | DiscriminatorToken}`.
> Morphological choices never override **I/D/S layers** or **CHR\:ReferencePlane** semantics.

### 8.0 Casing & basic forms

**M‑0 (Casing and categories).**
Types & role kinds: **UpperCamelCase** (`IncisionOperatorRole`, `MethodDescription`).
Relations/verbs: **lowerCamelCase** (`performedBy`, `isExecutionOf`, `bindsMethod`).
IDs/instances: **flat with delimiters** (context‑defined) but never collide with type forms (e.g., `W#Seam134`, `ctx:Hospital.OR_2025`).
**Register discipline:** normative tokens use the Technical register; Plain synonyms are allowed in prose only, never in constraints.

---

### 8.1 Reserved suffixes (gated by LEX.TokenClass and I/D/S)

> **Use table as a whitelist.** Rows indicate **when** a suffix is permitted and **what it means**. “Layer gate” prevents I/D/S confusion; “Examples” are illustrative.

| **Suffix**              | **Kind named** (object‑of‑talk)            | **Layer gate**                       | **LEX.TokenClass gate**         | **Examples**                                      | **Forbidden misuses (typical)**                                       |

| **`MethodDescription`** | **Recipe/description** (notation‑agnostic) | D‑layer                              | KernelToken/ContextToken        | `JS_Schedule_v4_MethodDescription`                | Calling it “process”; encoding runtime actuals here.                  |
| **`Work`**              | **Execution** (runs or kinds of runs)      | (run artefact; not I/D/S)            | ContextToken                    | `SpeechActWork`, `W#Seam134`                      | Plans/schedules; design‑time recipes.                                 |
| **`WorkPlan`**          | **Schedule of intent**                     | D‑layer (plan artefact)              | ContextToken                    | `MaintenanceWorkPlan_Q3`                          | Logging actuals; claiming execution.                                  |

| **`EvidenceRole`**      | **Role in evidence assembly**              | I‑layer (role kind)                  | KernelToken/ContextToken        | `WitnessStatementEvidenceRole`                    | Using as a generic “evidence”.                                        |
| **`Episteme`**          | **Epistemic knowledge unit** (structural)  | D/S‑layer                            | KernelToken/ContextToken        | `TraceabilityEpisteme`                            | Colliding with CHR **ReferencePlane** (never suffix “Plane”).         |
| **`System`/`Holon`**    | **Substantial entity**                     | I‑layer                              | KernelToken/ContextToken        | `AnesthesiaSystem`, `OrderFulfillmentHolon`       | Using to denote Context or run artefact.                              |

**Notes.**
• **Kernel‑only ban list** remains in § 8.3.
• **CHR guard:** the only token that may use the word *plane* is **ReferencePlane** (CHR).
• **Axis/dimension metaphors** are deprecated; use **Characteristic / CharacteristicSpace** where an enumeration is intended (see § 7).

---

### 8.2 Forbidden suffixes & the DevOps Lexical Firewall

**M‑F (Forbidden in Kernel tokens).** In KernelToken names, do **not** use: *…Function*, *…Process*, *…Task*, *…Activity*. These are ambiguous or vacuous—map using § 6 typing rules (often to `Method`, `MethodDescription`, or `Work`).

**M‑FW (Tool/file markers).** Tooling/file suffixes (*…API*, *…JSON*, *…YAML*, *…CI*, *…Kafka*, *…Postgres*) are **not** part of conceptual names. Place them in **Context** glossaries or operational configs (DevOps Lexical Firewall). Kernel names never carry tool/format marks.

### 8.3 Prefix discipline

**M‑P1 (Reserved prefixes).** `U.` reserved for **Kernel types**; `Γ_` for algebraic operators; `CAL/LOG/CHR` for **architheory packages**. Never mint `U.*` inside a Context.

**M‑P2 (Edition markers).** Apply explicit edition/version markers to **Contexts** and to `MethodDescription` / `Service`—**not** to `Method` (e.g., `BPMN_2.0_BoundedContext`, `JS_Schedule_v4_MethodDescription`, `PassportIssuanceService_v2025`).

### 8.4 Morphology tests (apply with § 7 MG·DA)

**M‑1 (Slot test).** The candidate fits **one** slot in the Strict Distinction lattice (Object ≠ Description ≠ Carrier; Role ≠ Method ≠ Work). If not, **rename** or split.

**M‑2 (Object‑of‑talk anchoring).** The head noun names the **object being classified** (Role/Method/Service/Work/Context/Characteristic). No free‑floating metaphors.

**M‑3 (Family congruence).** Where eligibility clarity is needed, add a **Context‑specific characteristic** (RCS) as a qualifier (e.g., `NormativeStandardRole`). Do **not** fake families with bare metaphors (no `RowPlane`, `senseFamily`, `…Lane`).

**M‑4 (Run vs design).** Use **`Work`** only for executions; use **`MethodDescription`** for recipes; never cross.

**M‑5 (Kernel parochiality).** KernelToken names carry **no domain nouns**; push domain markers to Context or RCS.

**M‑6 (Vacuity ban).** Avoid vacuous heads (*Thing, Event, Process, Resource*). Use established kernel heads (`U.Holon`, `U.Work`, `U.Method`, `U.Resrc`, …).

**M‑7 (Notation independence).** Intensional meaning survives notation/tool swaps.

**M‑8 (Collision & uniqueness).** Before merge, run **full‑text** + **Reserved‑Names** checks; the token must not collide with any other meaning anywhere in FPF (cf. § 7 MGD‑T5).

### 8.5 Alias hygiene

Aliases live **only** inside a **Context Glossary** and map to **one** technical label with an **equivalence** note (≡). No global aliases.

### 8.6 Compatibility with USM (acts vs tokens)

**LEX applies to tokens; USM applies to acts.** Mint/rename/use are **LexicalActs** that carry a USM scope (e.g., ClaimScope, WorkScope). LEX constrains **where** a token form may appear via **AllowedScopes** policies:

`LEX.TokenClass(t)=c  ⇒  USM.Scope(usage) ∈ AllowedScopes(c)`.

Example: using a `KernelToken` in a Context constraint may require a Bridge/alias; logging `Work` inside a MethodDescription violates M‑4 and the policy.

### 8.7 Acceptance & regression checks (LEX/USM)

* **SCR‑MOR‑S01 (Suffix whitelist).** Every normative token with a reserved suffix matches § 8.1 row semantics and passes Layer gates.
* **SCR‑MOR‑S02 (Kernel bans).** KernelToken names contain none of the forbidden suffixes (§ 8.2).
* **SCR‑MOR‑S03 (Prefixes).** Reserved prefixes obey § 8.3; no `U.*` minted in Context.
* **SCR‑MOR‑S04 (Run/design gate).** `Work` appears only for executions; `MethodDescription` has no runtime actuals.
* **SCR‑MOR‑S05 (Collision).** Full‑text + Reserved‑Names checks pass (no other sense of the token elsewhere).
* **SCR‑MOR‑S06 (Object‑of‑talk).** Heads pass M‑2; no bare metaphors as heads.
* **RSCR‑MOR‑E01 (DevOps firewall).** Tool/file suffixes quarantined to Context; none leak into KernelToken names.
* **RSCR‑MOR‑E02 (USM compliance).** For each LexicalAct, `USM.Scope ∈ AllowedScopes(LEX.TokenClass)`.

### 8.8 Examples (illustrative)

Prefer **`U.Service`** (promise) over *BusinessService*; **`U.Capability`** over *Function*; **`U.Dynamics`** over *NaturalProcess*; **`U.WorkPlan`** over *ScheduleProcess*.
Do **not** mint *ETLService* at kernel level—model ETL as `MethodDescription`; the **Service** is “data delivered under acceptance.”

**Notes for editors**

* This section **inherits** § 7 MG·DA rules (Object‑of‑talk anchoring, Characteristic/CharacteristicSpace, collision checks) and **does not** redefine them.
* The only legitimate use of *plane* is in **CHR\:ReferencePlane**; I/D/S are “**layers**”; Part‑F uses explicit Characteristics (e.g., `SenseFamily`) rather than spatial metaphors.

## 9 · Canonical rewrites for overloaded words (LEX L‑rules; normative)

> **What this section does.** LEX L‑rules standardise **how we speak** in Core/Context by mapping overloaded everyday words to **canonical FPF concepts**.
> **What this section does not do.** It does **not** restate naming (see **§ 7 MG·DA**) or morphology/casing/suffix rules (see **§ 8 LEX.Morph**); it **depends** on them.
> **Guards.** Tokens are classified by **`LEX.TokenClass ∈ {KernelToken, ContextToken, DiscriminatorToken}`** (§ 7.1). Only **CHR\:ReferencePlane** may use the bare word *plane*; I/D/S are **layers**; enumerations are **Characteristics** in a **CharacteristicSpace**.

### 9.1 Hard bans and canonical rewrites (single table; normative)

> **Use this table mechanically.** “Ban” means the weak phrase is **not allowed** in Core prose/identifiers/diagrams unless the **canonical** appears alongside it (or as a registered Context alias). “Layer/Token gates” prevent I/D/S and TokenClass leaks (cf. § 8.1).

### 9.3 Acceptance tests (LEX‑AC)

A text **passes** LEX if all answers are **Green**:

1. **Context named.** Polysemous terms appear **inside a named `U.BoundedContext`** (or the page declares a local context card).
2. **Right layer.** I/D/S layer respected: types/roles on I; recipes/docs on D; actuals on runs (cf. § 8.1 gates).
3. **Promise vs ability vs performance.** `Service` (promise), `Capability` (ability), `Work` (performance) are not conflated.
4. **No anthropomorphism.** Documents/datasets/models do not “do”; **Systems** do.
5. **Scheduling hygiene.** No actuals on `WorkPlan`; all actuals live on `Work`.
6. **Cross‑context reuse.** Any reuse across Contexts cites a **Bridge id** with CL & loss notes.
7. **MG·DA ok.** New or refactored tokens pass **§ 7 MG·DA** (anchored head noun; collision check; CharacteristicSpace for enums).
8. **Morphology ok.** Suffix/prefix/casing respect **§ 8 LEX.Morph** (e.g., `…Role`, `MethodDescription`, `Work`, reserved prefixes).
9. **Banned tokens absent.** No *process/function/task/activity* in Kernel senses; no tooling/file suffixes in Kernel tokens.
10. **State gating present (when needed).** Readiness is expressed via **RSG state** + **StateAssertion**, not vague “approved/ready”.

### 9.4 Coordination map (how LEX plugs into the rest of FPF)

* **With E.10.D1 D.CTX (Context discipline).**
  ULR–CTX‑1: Every Core meaning that can vary **names its `U.BoundedContext`**.
  ULR–CTX‑2: Same‑spelled labels are **distinct senses** across Contexts; reuse requires a **Bridge** (F.9) with CL & loss notes.

* **With E.10.D2 (I/D/S discipline).**
  Speak in the **right I/D/S layer**. ULR–IDS‑1..3 apply (types/roles = I; descriptions/specs = D/S; work/state assertions = evaluations/occurrences). Upgrades D→S only when **checkable acceptance** exists.

* **With A.2 / A.15 (Role–Method–Work alignment).**
  Role = **assignment**; Method = **way‑of‑doing**; MethodDescription = **documented recipe**; Work = **dated occurrence**. Sentences must keep this split.

* **With F‑cluster (Unification) & UTS (F.17).**
  Harvest in one Context → **SenseCell** → **Concept‑Set row** with relation (`≡/⋈/⊂/⟂`) and losses. UTS is the human‑readable roll‑up.

> **Acts vs tokens.** LEX applies to **tokens**; USM applies to **acts** (mint/rename/use). Conformance: `LEX.TokenClass(t)=c ⇒ USM.Scope(usage) ∈ AllowedScopes(c)` (see § 7.5).

---

### 9.5 Conformance checklist (LEX‑CC)

1. **LEX‑CC‑1 (Bans).** Any banned token in Core/Arch fails unless the **canonical** appears (or the token is a registered Context alias).
2. **LEX‑CC‑2 (Context).** Each polysemous term names its **`U.BoundedContext`**.
3. **LEX‑CC‑3 (Layer/Morph).** Usage passes **§ 8** gates (suffix/prefix/casing) and I/D/S layer checks.
4. **LEX‑CC‑4 (Bridge).** Cross‑context reuse cites **Bridge id** and CL; same‑spelled labels without a Bridge are non‑conformant.
5. **LEX‑CC‑5 (MG·DA).** New tokens pass **MG·DA** tests, including **full‑text collision** and **Reserved‑Names** checks.
6. **LEX‑CC‑6 (Service & evidence).** Service acceptance computed from **Work**; evidence is an **EvidenceRole** on an **Episteme** with provenance.
7. **LEX‑CC‑7 (USM compatibility).** For each LexicalAct, `USM.Scope ∈ AllowedScopes(LEX.TokenClass)`.

**Editorial note.**
This section **inherits** § 7 **MG·DA** (anchored head nouns; Characteristic/CharacteristicSpace for enums; collision checks) and § 8 **LEX.Morph** (suffix/prefix/casing). It deliberately **omits** their details to avoid duplication. The only legitimate use of *plane* remains **CHR\:ReferencePlane**; all other “plane/layer/tier/lane” talk must pass § 7 (object‑of‑talk anchoring) or be expressed as an explicit **Characteristic**.

## 10 · Migration playbook — turning messy language into ULR‑clean prose *(informative)*

> A pragmatic **three‑pass** routine. Works with plain text, diagrams, or models; no tools required.

### Pass 0 — *Pre‑flight (2 minutes per page)*

0.1 **Name the Context card** you’re writing in (title, edition, scope note).
0.2 For every new or renamed token, **declare `LEX.TokenClass`** ∈ {KernelToken, ContextToken, DiscriminatorToken}.
0.3 Run **MG·DA pre‑check** (anchored head noun; no metaphor heads; if enum → declare its **CharacteristicSpace**).
0.4 Run **collision/uniqueness**: full‑text grep + Reserved‑Names registry (see § 7). If collides → rename or DRR deprecate.

### Pass 1 — *Harvest in the Context*

1.1 **Underline overloaded words** (*process, service, function, workflow, ticket, approval, spec, plan,* …).
1.2 For each, write a **one‑line intent** in Plain register (what object‑of‑talk is meant).
1.3 Mark any cross‑Context reuse candidates.

### Pass 2 — *Map to Core anchors (mechanical)*

2.1 Replace underlined words via **§ 9 L‑rules** table:
 • recipe → **`U.Method` / `U.MethodDescription`**
 • scheduled run → **`U.Work` / `U.WorkPlan`**
 • promise → **`U.Service`**
 • ability → **`U.Capability`**
 • actor‑mask → **`…Role / RoleAssignment`**
 • document/evidence carrier → **`Episteme`** with **`EvidenceRole/RequirementRole`**
2.2 Apply **LEX.Morph** (§ 8): suffix gates (`…Role/…Work/MethodDescription/Service`), casing, reserved prefixes.
2.3 Pass **I/D/S layer** check: types/roles on I; recipes/docs on D; actuals on runs.
2.4 Attach **Context tags** on first use; set **twin labels** (Tech/Plain) in the local Glossary.

### Pass 3 — *Stitch & publish*

3.1 Add **safe rewrites** for any anti‑patterns you found (use § 9.2 quick table).
3.2 If sameness is needed across Contexts, create a **Bridge** (F.9) with relation kind, **CL**, and loss notes.
3.3 Publish a one‑page **UTS** (F.17) for the Context (columns: Context, Tech label, Plain label, Kernel anchor, Warnings).
3.4 Log a short **DRR** when renames/aliases occur (F.13), linking to grep results that motivated the change.

## 11 · ULR conformance prompts *(normative, concept‑only questions)*

> Use these **prompts** during review. They reference § 7 (MG·DA) and § 8 (LEX.Morph) instead of repeating them.

1. **Context prompt.** Does each potentially polysemous noun live inside a **named `U.BoundedContext`**?
2. **Layer prompt.** Is each sentence in the correct **I/D/S layer** (I: type/role; D: description/spec; run: actuals)?
3. **Token prompt.** For new/renamed tokens, is **`LEX.TokenClass`** declared and consistent with where the token appears?
4. **Object‑of‑talk prompt.** Does the **head noun** name the object being classified (Role/Method/Service/Work/Context/Characteristic)?
5. **Morphology prompt.** Do suffix/prefix/casing pass **LEX.Morph** gates (e.g., `…Role`, `MethodDescription`, `Work`)?
6. **Promise vs ability vs performance.** Are **Service** (promise), **Capability** (ability), and **Work** (performance) distinct?
7. **Plan vs execution.** Are **WorkPlan** windows separated from **Work** actuals?
8. **Evidence prompt.** Do documents **hold roles** and **justify**, while **systems act**?
9. **Bridge prompt.** If sameness spans Contexts, is there an explicit **Bridge** with **CL** and loss notes?
10. **Collision prompt.** Did we run full‑text + Reserved‑Names checks (no other meaning of this token anywhere in FPF)?

## 12 · ULR regression cues *(concept‑only “diff” triggers)*

Re‑review your prose when any of these happen:

* **Context edition** changes → re‑affirm twin labels, Bridges, and acceptance wording.
* **A role/type name grows** (“and/plus/‑‑”) → apply MG·DA: split or bundle (A.2).
* **A “service” statement broadens scope** → check that **acceptance** terms cover the new target; else split the Service.
* **Recipes gain/lose steps** → update **`MethodDescription`**, not `Service` or `Role` names.
* **Evidence verbs creep into actor sentences** → re‑apply L‑rules (documents don’t act).
* **New token minted** → ensure `LEX.TokenClass` declared; run collision checks; add CharacteristicSpace if enum.
* **Suffix drift** (e.g., `…Work` on a plan) → fix via **LEX.Morph**.
* **Cross‑Context reuse by label** appears → require a **Bridge** (F.9) or split senses.

## 13 · Teaching deck — the ULR quick card *(reusable in any Context)*

> **Say it cleanly, once (memorise):**
> **Role** = assignment (mask) · **Method** = way‑of‑doing · **MethodDescription** = recipe (document) · **Work** = run (dated)
> **Capability** = can‑do within bounds (envelope + measures) · **Service** = promise (access + acceptance)
> **I/D/S are layers**; **documents don’t act**; **Contexts own meanings**; **Bridges** move meanings.

**Name forms (allowed morphology):**
• **Types/roles:** `<Noun><Role/Type>` (`IncidentCommanderRole`, `NormativeStandardRole`, `WorkItemType`).
• **Statuses:** `<Noun>Status` inside the Context’s role space (`ApprovedStatus`) — status‑only; not enactable.
• **No suitcase nouns:** avoid “and/plus/&” in names; use **bundles** (A.2) or separate roles.
• **Acronyms:** first expansion + register; short‑form registered per **§ 7.7**.

## 14 · Three worked micro‑examples — ULR across domains *(informative)*

### 14.1 Healthcare (OR context)

**Messy:** “The surgical **process** is scheduled at 08:00; the SOP approves the incision and the **service** documents recovery.”
**ULR rewrite:**
“**WorkPlan** OR‑Case‑221 starts 08:00 and will execute **MethodDescription** `Incision_v4`.
`SOP_OR_v4` holds **RequirementRole**; a **SpeechAct Work** by `QA_Officer#ApproverRole` authorises the run.
The hospital offers **Service** ‘Post‑op monitoring’ (access = ward protocol; acceptance = vitals envelope).”

### 14.2 Manufacturing (assembly line)

**Messy:** “The welding **function** provides air‑tight seams; the **process** costs 3 min.”
**ULR rewrite:**
“`Robot_SN789` has **Capability** ‘execute `Weld_MIG_v3` within envelope E at measures M’.
**Work** instances that **fulfil Service** ‘Provide seam S’ average 3 min; **acceptance** bounds are in `Seal_Acceptance.md`.
The **MethodDescription** is `Weld_MIG_v3`; the **Role** is `WelderRole`.”

### 14.3 Cloud/SRE (production Context)

**Messy:** “The storage **service** wrote logs and the deployment **process** failed after 2 min.”
**ULR rewrite:**
“`sCG‑Spec_ci_bot#DeployerRole:CD_v7` performed **Work** ‘Deploy r4711’ (failed at T+120 s).
The platform offers **Service** ‘Object Storage’ (access = `S3_API_Spec_vX`; **acceptance** = durability/availability targets).
`LogWriter` is a **System** bearing `TransformerRole` that wrote the records; *the service did not act*.”

* **Notation‑agnostic.** ULR is a **language constitution**, not a scanner or template. Apply it in prose, sketches, or formal models.
* **Where checks live.** Convenience checks belong to Tooling; ULR itself stays notation‑agnostic.
* **Acts vs tokens.** LEX applies to **tokens**; USM applies to **acts** (mint/rename/use). Conformance:
  `LEX.TokenClass(t)=c  ⇒  USM.Scope(usage) ∈ AllowedScopes(c)` (§ 7.5).
* **Guards honoured.** DevOps Lexical Firewall and Unidirectional Dependency remain intact.
* **Reserved “plane”.** Only **`CHR:ReferencePlane`** uses the bare word *plane*; I/D/S are **layers**; all other category talk is expressed as **Characteristics** in a **CharacteristicSpace**.

> **One‑line memory:** *“ULR keeps words honest so ideas stay composable.”*

  
  # E.10.P — **Conceptual Prefixes (policy & registry)**  \[A]
 **Intent.** Provide a compact, **notation‑neutral** registry and **minting policy** for *conceptual prefixes* — short shorthands that signal **cognitive namespaces** used throughout the Core.

 **Policy (normative).**
1. **Purpose.** A conceptual prefix exists **to aid reasoning**, not to name files, serialisations, or APIs. It labels a **role in thought** (e.g., meta‑type, calculus operator, relation family).
 2. **Anchoring.** Every prefix **MUST** be anchored to a **Core architheory**  (CAL/LOG/CHR) or Kernel construct and documented in its *Relations*.
 3. **No tool lock‑in.** A prefix **MUST NOT** imply a particular notation or machine binding (see E.5.1–E.5.2).
 4. **Minting rule.** New prefixes are introduced by a **DRR** (E.9) that demonstrates
    (a) cross‑architheory need, 
    (b) non‑overlap with existing prefixes,
    (c) alignment with Pillars **P‑1/P‑5**.
 5. **Scope.** Prefixes are **globally reserved** within the Core; domain plugins  **MAY** mint local shorthands only inside their Contexts and **MUST NOT** collide with this registry.

 **Registered conceptual prefixes (Core).**
* `U.` — **U.Types meta‑namespace** (holons & primitives). *Anchor:* Kernel Part A.
* `Γ_` — **Calculus operator family** (by flavour: `Γ_sys`, `Γ_epist`, …). *Anchor:* Part B umbrella on Γ.
* `ut:` — **Universal relation family** (e.g., `PartOf` sub‑relations). *Anchor:* A.14 (Mereology) — informative alias vocabulary.
* `tv:` — **Trace & Validation vocabulary** (CT2R‑LOG): `tv:AliasOf`, `tv:groundedBy`. *Anchor:* B.3 (Trust & Assurance, LOG‑use). 
* `ev:` — **Evidence hooks** (bindings/roles). *Anchor:* A.10 / B.3 (Evidence Anchoring).
* `mero:` — **Mereology trace types** (internal labels: `SumTrace` / `SetTrace` / `SliceTrace`) used **informatively** in examples. *Anchor:* B.1 (Γ‑aggregation).

**Conformance Checklist (E.10.P).**
* **CC‑LEX‑P.1** New Core text **SHALL NOT** introduce an unregistered conceptual prefix.
* **CC‑LEX‑P.2** Each occurrence of a registered prefix **SHALL** cite its anchor pattern on first use in a section.
* **CC‑LEX‑P.3** Examples that expand a prefix into a concrete URI or syntax **MUST** mark the expansion *informative* and locate it in Tooling/Pedagogy.

**Relations.** Constrains E.5.1 (Lexical Firewall) & E.5.2 (Notational Independence); Depends on E.9 (DRR).
  
# E.10.D1 — Lexical Discipline for “Context” (D.CTX) \[D]

> **One‑sentence summary.** Make the word **Context** unambiguous: in FPF it **only** denotes the formal primitive **`U.BoundedContext`**; remove the term **anchor**; reserve **Problem Frame** for situational narrative; treat **Domain** as an **informative family label**, not a type.

**Status.** Discipline \[D], architheory‑agnostic.
**Depends on.** C‑6 *Strict Distinction*; C‑7 *Temporal Duality*; G‑1 *Minimal Generality*; G‑2 *Contextual Specification*.
**Coordinates with.** E.10.U1 *Domain‑Family Landscape Survey*; E.10.U2 *Term Harvesting & Normalisation*; E.10.U7 *Concept‑Set Table*; E.10.U9 *Alignment/Bridge*; `RoleAssigning` patterns (e.g., E.10.U4).
**Aliases (informative).** Context Discipline; No‑Anchor Rule.

---

## 1 · Intent & Applicability

**Intent.** Eliminate ambiguity around “context” by (a) fixing **one** formal meaning—`U.BoundedContext`; (b) removing “anchor” from the vocabulary; (c) reserving **Problem Frame** for prose about situations; and (d) clarifying **Domain** as an **informative family** (workflow, provenance, services, …) that groups several `U.BoundedContext`s.

**Applicability.** Mandatory across **all architheories** (Role Assignment & Enactment, Sys-CAL, KD-CAL, Kind-CAL, planned LCA-CAL). Apply at the start of any unification effort and whenever documentation introduces or refactors “context”, “domain”, “anchor”.

**Non‑goals.** No governance, workflow, or tool mandates; no storage formats; no team roles.

---

## 2 · Problem Frame

1. **Polysemy.** “Context” is used for formal scopes, narrative situations, and even runtime modes.
2. **Extra token (“anchor”).** “Anchor” pretends to be “where meaning is attached”, duplicating context semantics.
3. **Domain overreach.** “Domain context” conflates **families** (disciplinary areas) with **formal contexts**.
4. **Plane mixing.** Runtime/design stances and deontic/behavioural notions are smuggled into “context”.

---

## 4 · Solution — **Name one thing “Context” can mean**

**D‑CTX‑1 (Canonical meaning).** In all FPF materials, **Context** denotes the formal primitive **`U.BoundedContext`** only. The short form **Context** is permitted in the *Tech* register strictly as an alias of `U.BoundedContext`.

**D‑CTX‑2 (Remove “anchor”).** The term **anchor** is **prohibited**. When you need “the place where a meaning lives”, use:

* **`SenseCell := (U.BoundedContext, Local‑Sense)`** — the *cell of meaning* inside a specific Context; or
* a **`ConceptSet.Row`** + column reference (see E.10.U7).

**D‑CTX‑3 (Domain is informative).** **Domain** (workflow, provenance, services, access, sensing, …) is **not** a U.Type. It is an **informative family label** grouping several `U.BoundedContext`s. There is no “domain context”.

**D‑CTX‑4 (Narrative is Problem Frame).** Use **Problem Frame** (or **Frame**) for situational narrative in patterns. Do **not** use “context” for narrative sections.

**D‑CTX‑5 (Time is a tag, not a context).** `design` / `run` are **TimeScope tags** (C‑7) on artefacts or sources; they do **not** create separate contexts.

**D‑CTX‑6 (No context inheritance).** `U.BoundedContext`s have **no is‑a** or containment relations. Any cross‑context relationship appears **only** via E.10.U9 *Alignment/Bridge* with explicit loss policies.

**D‑CTX‑7 (Language/edition discipline).** Different languages or editions may be **distinct `U.BoundedContext`s** when meaning or usage can diverge. Where an official source binds multilingual labels to the **same** semantics, record them as **labels** of the **same** Context.

**D‑CTX‑8 (Reference forms).** Use **one of the following** when pointing to meaning:

* **`ContextId:LocalLabel`** (e.g., `BPMN_2_0:process`), or
* **`SenseCell(ContextId, Local‑SenseId)`**, or
* **ConceptSet(RowId).Column(ContextId)** (E.10.U7).

---

## 5 · Structure — Minimal reference shapes (informative)

> Shapes shown **do not** prescribe formats; they are naming conventions.

* **Context Id.** Stable short handle (e.g., `BPMN_2_0`, `PROV_O_2013`, `ITIL4_2020`, `NIST_RBAC_2004`, `SOSA_SSN_2017`).
* **SenseCell.** `(ContextId, Local‑Sense)` where `Local‑Sense` is the Context‑local preferred label (from E.10.U2).
* **ConceptSet Row.** A table row keyed by a row id; columns are `SenseCell`s per Context (E.10.U7).

---

## 6 · Core Invariants (normative)

1. **LCTX‑INV‑1 (Uni‑meaning).** The word **Context** in formal text equals **`U.BoundedContext`**.
2. **LCTX‑INV‑2 (No anchor).** The token **anchor** does **not** appear in normative prose; use **SenseCell** or **ConceptSet reference**.
3. **LCTX‑INV‑3 (No domain contexts).** “Domain context” is invalid; use **Domain family** + list of `U.BoundedContext`s.
4. **LCTX‑INV‑4 (Frames, not contexts).** Pattern headers use **Problem Frame** for narrative.
5. **LCTX‑INV‑5 (No hierarchy).** Contexts are flat; relationships are declared **only** via E.10.U9 Bridges.
6. **LCTX‑INV‑6 (Plane hygiene).** Contexts describe **context of meaning** for sources; they are not roles, statuses, executions, or types (C‑6).
7. **LCTX‑INV‑7 (Time tags).** Temporal stance is a **tag** on artefacts/sources; it does not multiply contexts.
8. **LCTX‑INV‑8 (Language/edition).** Multilingual or multi‑edition handling follows D‑CTX‑7.

---

## 7 · Conformance Checklist (normative)

* **CC‑LCTX‑1.** Grep‑style check: every “Context” in formal sections expands to **`U.BoundedContext`**.
* **CC‑LCTX‑2.** The token **anchor** is absent from normative text; where needed, occurrences are replaced by **SenseCell** or **ConceptSet reference**.
* **CC‑LCTX‑3.** Pattern headers use **Problem Frame**; none use “Context” for narrative.
* **CC‑LCTX‑4.** References to meaning are in one of the **reference forms** (Sec. 5).
* **CC‑LCTX‑5.** No file defines “domain context”; Domain appears only as an **informative family**.
* **CC‑LCTX‑6.** No is‑a edges between contexts; any cross‑context relation is located in **E.10.U9**.
* **CC‑LCTX‑7.** Language/edition handling matches **D‑CTX‑7** (separate Contexts when semantics can diverge).

| **A2 Anchor-speak**           | “role anchor”, “ontology anchor”                                   | Redundant token; hides locality      | Replace with **SenseCell** or **ConceptSet(Row).Column** (D-CTX-2, D-CTX-8). |
| **A3 Domain context**         | “Workflow domain context”, etc.                                   | Family ≠ formal context              | Use **Domain family** + explicit list of Context ids (D‑CTX‑3).              |

| **A6 Cross‑lingual blending** | Mixing language labels as one context despite divergent semantics | Hidden drift                         | Split Contexts per **D‑CTX‑7** or document shared semantics if truly bound.  |

## 9 · Worked Examples (multi‑architheory)

**9.1 Enactment — process vs activity (two context of meaning).**

* Use `BPMN_2_0:process` and `PROV_O_2013:activity` as **SenseCell**s.
* In a Concept‑Set row, code the provisional relation `⋈` (overlap), not an equality.
* Role Descriptions later reference **the specific SenseCell**, not “an anchor”.

**9.2 Roles — behavioural mask vs access status.**

* `BPMN_2_0:participant` vs `NIST_RBAC_2004:role`.
* Mark `⟂` (incompatible) in the Concept‑Set row to prevent conflation.
* Any cross‑use requires E.10.U9 with explicit loss policy.

**9.3 Services & evidence.**

* `ITIL4_2020:service` / `ITIL4_2020:service‑level‑objective` with KD‑CAL cells `SOSA_SSN_2017:observation`.
* References in acceptance patterns point to **SenseCell**s; provenance stays within the PROV Context.

---

## 10 · Reasoning Primitives (conceptual judgements; notation‑agnostic)

> Pure **thinking moves**; no APIs, no storage, no governance.

* **(J1) Context expansion.** `⊢ Context ≡ U.BoundedContext`
  *Reading:* wherever “Context” appears in formal prose, it denotes `U.BoundedContext`.

* **(J2) Anchor ban.** `uses("anchor") ⊢ violation(D‑CTX‑2)`
  *Reading:* usage of “anchor” flags a discipline violation.

* **(J3) Sense reference.** `ref(ContextId, LocalLabel) ⊢ SenseCell(ContextId, Local‑Sense)`
  *Reading:* a well‑formed reference identifies a SenseCell.

* **(J4) Narrative frame.** `header("Context") ⊢ replaceWith("Problem Frame")`
  *Reading:* headings “Context” in patterns must become “Problem Frame”.

* **(J5) Domain family.** `label ∈ {workflow,…} ⊢ DomainFamily(label)`
  *Reading:* Domain labels are families, not contexts.

* **(J6) Time tag.** `stance ∈ {design, run} ⊢ TimeScopeTag(stance)`
  *Reading:* time is a tag, not a new context.

---

## 11 · Relations (with other patterns)

**Builds on:** C‑6, C‑7, G‑1, G‑2.
**Constrains:**

* **E.10.U1** — lists only `U.BoundedContext`s; no “domain contexts”; context records never encode architheory semantics.
* **E.10.U2** — Seeds and Occurrences are **always** Context‑anchored; references use forms from Sec. 5.
* **E.10.U7** — Columns are **SenseCell**s; row notes never call them “anchors”.
* **E.10.U9** — All cross‑context relations live here; no implicit equivalences elsewhere.
* **`RoleAssigning` patterns (E.10.U4, …)** — Context points to **SenseCell** or **Concept‑Set columns**, never to “anchors”.

---

## 12 · Migration Notes (conceptual playbook)

1. **Rename headings.** Replace any “Context” section title with **Problem Frame**.
2. **Delete “anchor”.** Replace with **SenseCell** or **Concept‑Set** references.
3. **Split domain vs context.** Where “domain context” appears, rewrite as **Domain family** + explicit list of `U.BoundedContext`s.
4. **Audit references.** Ensure every semantic reference is `ContextId:LocalLabel` or `SenseCell(ContextId, …)` or Concept‑Set column.
5. **Flatten contexts.** Remove any inheritance among contexts; move relations to **E.10.U9**.
6. **Tag time.** Replace “design/runtime context” with **TimeScope tags**.
7. **Language/edition pass.** Split or merge Contexts per **D‑CTX‑7**; document rationale.

---

## 13 · Acceptance Tests (SCR/RSCR stubs)

**SCR — Static discipline checks**

* **SCR‑DCTX‑S01.** No occurrence of the token **anchor** in normative sections.
* **SCR‑DCTX‑S02.** All formal uses of “Context” resolve to **`U.BoundedContext`**.
* **SCR‑DCTX‑S03.** Pattern headers contain **Problem Frame** instead of “Context”.
* **SCR‑DCTX‑S04.** All semantic references use the forms in Sec. 5.
* **SCR‑DCTX‑S05.** No “domain context” strings; Domain appears only as family metadata.
* **SCR‑DCTX‑S06.** No is‑a or containment relations between contexts outside **E.10.U9**.

**RSCR — Regression discipline checks**

* **RSCR‑DCTX‑E01.** Adding a new family or edition does not introduce “domain context” or context hierarchies.
* **RSCR‑DCTX‑E02.** Refactors of E.10.U1/U.2/U.7/U.9 do not re‑introduce “anchor”.
* **RSCR‑DCTX‑E03.** Multilingual updates follow D‑CTX‑7 (split/merge rationale recorded informatively).
  
  # E.10.D2 — Intension–Description–Specification Discipline (I/D/S) \[D]

*Definitional pattern — normative, notation‑agnostic*

> **One‑sentence summary.** For every intensional FPF object (e.g., `U.Role`, `U.Method`, `U.System`, `U.Work`, `U.Service`), clearly distinguish the **thing itself** (*Intension*), its **context‑bound Description** (KU), and its **formal Specification** (KU). Use **–Spec** only when strict, testable invariants and an acceptance harness exist; otherwise use **–Description**. This keeps semantics clean, didactic, and testable across all architheories.

**Status.** Definitional \[D], architheory‑agnostic.
**Builds on:** A.7 **Strict Distinction (Clarity Lattice)**; E.10.D1 **D.CTX (Context ≡ U.BoundedContext)**; C.2.3 **Unified Formality Characteristic (F)**.
**Coordinates with.** F.4 **Role Description**; F.5 **Naming Discipline**; F.10 **Evaluation**; F.15 **SCR/RSCR Harness**.
**Non‑goals.** No editors, workflows, registries, or storage formats. No tooling commitments.

---

## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Prevent perennial confusions such as “the role contains the checklist” or “the method is the document.” Establish a universal discipline so that:

* **Intensions** (e.g., `U.Role`, `U.Method`) remain I/D/S layer‑pure and context‑agnostic entities in the kernel.
* **Descriptions** (KUs) capture human‑readable, **Context‑local** semantics (labels, glosses, characterisations, state graphs, checklists).
* **Specifications** (KUs) exist **only** when there are verifiable invariants, an acceptance harness, **and a declared Formality F adequate for checkability (C.2.3; default F ≥ F4)**, making claims testable.

**Applicability.** Whenever an FPF text introduces or uses an intensional `U.Type` (e.g., `U.Role`, `U.Method`, `U.Service`, `U.System`, `U.Work`, `U.RCS`, `U.RSG`, `U.RoleEnactment`) in any part (A–H).

---

## 2 · Problem frame

1. **Plane mixing.** Intensions are routinely conflated with their documents and with runtime facts.
2. **Name drift.** “Spec” gets used for any write‑up; “status” drifts between states of a role and epistemic/deontic statuses over knowledge units.
3. **Didactic friction.** Inconsistent naming raises cognitive load and impedes reuse across architheories.
4. **Unverifiable claims.** Without a clear gate to **–Spec**, normative wording appears without testability.

| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simplicity vs rigour**     | Easy‑to‑learn naming vs the need for machine‑checkable invariants.                |
| **Universality vs locality** | Kernel intensions must be universal; language and criteria are **Context‑local**. |
| **Stability vs evolution**   | Names should be stable; artefacts must mature via **ΔF** along the **F** ladder cleanly. |

## 4 · Solution — the I/D/S layer + a formal Spec‑gate

### 4.1 The triad (applies to **any** intensional `U.T`)

**Terminology discipline (normative).** Say **I/D/S layers** when you mean the **stratified order with a Spec‑gate**; say **I/D/S triad** only to note **three‑ness without order or dependency**. **Do not call I/D/S a “plane”.** Reserve **plane** for uses explicitly defined elsewhere (e.g., **`CHR:ReferencePlane`** and status families).
**Layer semantics (clarity).** **I‑layer** = **kernel/intensional type** (non‑epistemic; **not** a KU). **D‑layer** and **S‑layer** = **epistemic Knowledge Units** (KUs). The **Spec‑gate** upgrades a Description to a Specification only under declared checkability and harness conditions (unchanged).

For every intensional type `U.T`:

* **Intension — `U.T`.**
  The thing itself (e.g., `U.Role`, `U.Method`, `U.Service`, `U.System`, `U.Work`, `U.RCS`, `U.RSG`).
  *It does **not** contain documents, checklists, or carriers; it is not a runtime event or a file.*

* **Description KU — `U.TDescription(@Context)`**
  A **Context‑local** knowledge unit that **characterises** `U.T` with labels (Tech/Plain), glosses, and, when applicable, **Role Characterisation Space (`U.RCS`)**, **Role State Graph (`U.RSG`)**, and **state conformance checklists**.
  *Readable, precise, didactic; may reference evaluation criteria but does not assert testable “shall”s by itself.*

* **Specification KU — `U.TSpec(@Context)`**
  A **Context‑local** knowledge unit that states **testable invariants** for `U.T` and is **bound to an acceptance harness**.
  *Normative, verifiable, suitable for SCR/RSCR (F.15).*

> **Key phrasing discipline.** Intensions are **characterised by** (not “contain”) RCS/RSG/checklists, which **live in** the Description/Spec.
> **Terminology guard.** To avoid collisions with **ReferencePlane** and other semantic planes, the I/D/S triad is referred to as **I/D/S Layers** (Intension Layer · Description Layer · Specification Layer). The word **plane** is reserved for **semantic planes** (Role/Status/Measurement/Type‑structure/Method/Work, etc.) and for the **ReferencePlane** field used in aboutness/assurance.

### 4.2 The Spec‑gate (when “–Spec” is allowed)

Use the **–Spec** suffix **only if all** of the following hold:

1. **Formality F (C.2.3):** the artefact declares **F ≥ F4** (or a context-defined higher threshold) so predicates are checkable.
2. **Verifiability:** invariants are stated as checkable predicates or thresholds.
3. **Harness bound:** there is a linked **acceptance harness** (SCR/RSCR matrices per F.15).
4. **Context anchoring:** all wording is explicitly local to a named `U.BoundedContext` (E.10.D1).

If any condition is missing, the artefact **must be** a `…Description`.

---

### 4.3 Where RCS/RSG and evaluations sit

* **`U.RCS` (Role Characterisation Space)** and **`U.RSG` (Role State Graph)** are **intensional** types that structure the space of role characteristics and permissible state transitions.
* Their **human presentation** (characteristics, dimensions, node labels, admissible transitions) lives in the **RoleDescription**, and becomes part of **RoleSpec** only when the transitions and state predicates are made **testable** and harness‑bound.
* **`U.Evaluation`** operates on **evidence** against the conformance checklist (from the Description/Spec) to produce a **state attestation** (“X is in state S @Context within window W”).
* **Epistemic/deontic statuses** (e.g., *Evidence*, *Requirement*, *Standard*) are **roles over KUs** (not states of the role). They are governed elsewhere (F‑R family) and must not be conflated with `U.RSG` state names.

---

### 4.4 Plain‑language memory hook

> *Thing vs words vs rules.*
> **The thing** (`U.Role`, `U.Method`) is clean and abstract.
> **The words** (labels, glosses, RCS/RSG pictures, checklists) live in the **Description**.
> **The rules** (testable “shall”s with harness) live in the **Specification**.
> If you can’t test it, don’t call it **Spec**.

## 5 · Minimal vocabulary & naming discipline (this pattern only)

**Core trio (per intensional `U.T`).**

* **`U.T` — the Intension.**
  Kernel object (e.g., `U.Role`, `U.Method`, `U.Service`, `U.System`, `U.Work`, `U.RCS`, `U.RSG`).
  *Never* a document, *never* an event, *never* a file.

* **`U.TDescription(@Context)` — the Description KU.**
  Context‑local characterisation of `U.T`: Tech/Plain labels, gloss, notes; for roles, may **characterise** with an `U.RCS` (characteristics/traits), an `U.RSG` (states/transitions), and **state conformance checklists** (per state). *Readable; precise; not yet a set of testable “shall”s.*

* **`U.TSpec(@Context)` — the Specification KU.**
  Context‑local, **testable** invariant set for `U.T`, explicitly **bound to an acceptance harness** (SCR/RSCR matrices per F.15). Use **–Spec** only through the Spec‑gate (Sec. 4.2).

**Suffix rules.**

* Use **`…Description`** by default (M‑mode or F‑mode without harness).
* Use **`…Spec`** *only* when **all** Spec‑gate conditions (Sec. 4.2) hold.
* No alternative suffixes (“Profile”, “Definition”, “Guide”) inside the Core; such KUs live in pedagogy/tooling layers, not in the I/D/S discipline.

**Naming morphology (recap of F.5 as it applies here).**

* Two registers: **Tech** and **Plain** labels on every Description/Spec.
* Roles use **count nouns** (e.g., *Operator*); states use **state nouns** (e.g., *Approved*).
* Statuses over knowledge (e.g., Evidence/Requirement) are **not** role states; they name **roles over KUs** (F‑R family), not nodes in `U.RSG`.

**Context anchoring.**
Every Description/Spec is **local to** a `U.BoundedContext` (E.10.D1). Phrases in the KU must read correctly once prefixed by the Context name (e.g., “(ITIL4) Acceptance criteria …”).

**Carriers.**
`U.Carrier` holds **encodings** of a Description/Spec; the KU’s identity is **not** the file. *Never* say “the role contains the checklist in the PDF”; say “the **RoleDescription** characterises the role with checklists; this **carrier** encodes them.”

**Time stance.**
Descriptions/Specs must declare design/run stance when inherent (e.g., RoleDescription is design‑time; state attestation via `U.Evaluation` is run‑time).

---

## 6 · Invariants (normative)

**IDS‑1 (Plane purity).**
An intensional `U.T` **MUST NOT** be conflated with its Description/Spec or with any `U.Carrier` or `U.Work`.

**IDS‑2 (Context locality).**
Every `…Description/…Spec` **MUST** name a `U.BoundedContext`. Wording inside is read **as‑local**; no global meaning is implied.

**IDS-3 (Spec-gate).**
A KU **MUST NOT** use the **–Spec** suffix unless: *(a)* the artefact declares **`U.Formality = Fk` with k ≥ 4** per **C.2.3**, *(b)* invariants are testable predicates, *(c)* an acceptance harness is linked (F.15), *(d)* Context is explicit.

**IDS‑4 (Characterisation verbs).**
Texts **MUST** say: *“`U.Role` is **characterised by** `U.RCS`/`U.RSG` in the RoleDescription”*.
They **MUST NOT** say: *“the role **contains** the RCS/RSG”*.

**IDS‑5 (RCS/RSG scope).**
`U.RCS`/`U.RSG` are **intensional structures**. Their **presentations** (characteristics, state names, admissible transitions, checklists) live in the **RoleDescription**, and in **RoleSpec** only when transitions and state predicates are fully testable.

**IDS‑6 (Evaluation semantics).**
`U.Evaluation` **MUST** operate over evidence against conformance checklists from the Description/Spec and **MUST** produce a **state attestation** (who/what is in state *S* @Context within window *W*). Evaluation **does not** mutate the intensional object.

**IDS‑7 (Status separation).**
Epistemic/deontic statuses (Evidence/Requirement/Standard) are roles over **knowledge units**; they **MUST NOT** be used as state names in `U.RSG`.

**IDS‑8 (Register discipline).**
Every Description/Spec **SHOULD** include both **Tech** and **Plain** labels. Symbolic aliases are optional and informative.

**IDS‑9 (No stealth bridges).**
Descriptions/Specs **MUST NOT** import meanings from other Contexts by shared labels. Cross‑context relations exist only as **F.9 Bridges**.

**IDS‑10 (Window honesty).**
When an evaluation is time‑bounded, the **window** **MUST** be stated in the attestation.

**IDS‑11 (Ladder clarity).**
A Description may mature into a Spec by satisfying IDS‑3; the opposite move requires a rationale (loss of testability) and must drop the **–Spec** suffix.

**IDS‑12 (Didactic bound).**
A RoleDescription **SHOULD** fit on one screen per state graph plus one screen of notes; sprawling documents belong to pedagogy, not to the core Description.

## 7 · Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas, notation‑free)

> Judgements are **mental moves**—they assert what follows when premises hold. They do **not** imply queries, storage, or workflows.

1. **Description link**

   ```
   U.T, C ⊢ isDescriptionOf(TDesc, U.T, C)
   ```

   *Reading:* `TDesc` is the Context‑local Description of `U.T` in Context `C`.

2. **Spec link (Spec‑gate)**

```
isDescriptionOf(TDesc, U.T, C) ∧ U.Formality(TSpec) ≥ F4
   ∧ testableInvariants(TSpec) ∧ harnessBound(TSpec) 
   ⊢ isSpecOf(TSpec, U.T, C) 
```

   *Reading:* Only when F‑mode, testability, and harness are present may we judge `TSpec` a Specification of `U.T` in `C`.

3. **Role characterisation**

  ```
   isDescriptionOf(RoleDesc, U.Role, C)
   ∧ characterises(RoleDesc, U.RCS) ∧ characterises(RoleDesc, U.RSG)
   ⊢ characterisedBy(U.Role, {U.RCS, U.RSG}) @C
  ```

   *Reading:* The role is *characterised by* the RCS/RSG as presented in the Description (not that it “contains” them).

4. **State conformance predicate**

   ```
   checklistFor(RoleDesc, state S) = χ
   ∧ evidence E within window W
   ⊢ conformsToState(E, χ, W) ⇒ attestation(subject ∈ S @C, W)
   ```

   *Reading:* Evidence satisfies the checklist for state `S`, yielding a state attestation.

5. **Transition admissibility**

   ```
   U.RSG allows (S → S') @C
   ∧ attestation(subject ∈ S @C, W)
   ∧ conformsToState(E', checklistFor(S'), W')
   ⊢ admissibleTransition(subject : S → S' @C)
   ```

   *Reading:* A move from `S` to `S'` is admissible when RSG permits it and `S'` is satisfied.

6. **Status / state separation guard**

   ```
   statusOverKU(KU, σ) ∧ stateInRSG(ρ)
   ⊢ σ ≠ ρ  (distinct planes)
   ```

   *Reading:* A status over a knowledge unit is not a role‑state.

7. **No Cross‑context import**

   ```
   isDescriptionOf(TDescA, U.T, CA) ∧ isDescriptionOf(TDescB, U.T, CB) ∧ CA≠CB
   ⊢ ¬equateByLabel(TDescA, TDescB)  (bridges required in F.9)
   ```

   *Reading:* Identical wording across Contexts does not grant equivalence; only Bridges may relate them.

| ---- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A‑1  | **Spec‑by‑name**            | Every write‑up is titled “Spec”.                                     | Inflates normativity; untestable claims.  | Apply **Spec‑gate** (IDS‑3). If any condition fails, rename to `…Description`.                 |
| A‑2  | **Role contains RSG**       | “The role contains a state graph.”                                   | Plane mixing; mereological confusion.     | Use **characterised by** phrasing (IDS‑4); RSG presentation lives in RoleDescription/RoleSpec. |
| A‑3  | **Status ≡ state**          | *Approved* (status over KU) appears as a node in the role graph.     | Cross‑plane conflation; logic errors.     | Keep **statuses** (over KUs) separate from **role states** (IDS‑7).                            |
| A‑4  | **Stealth bridge**          | Copying state names across Contexts to imply sameness.                  | Hidden cross‑context import.              | Declare an **F.9 Bridge** or accept divergence (IDS‑9).                                        |
| A‑5  | **Checklist = process**     | Treating conformance checklist as an execution workflow.             | Category error (design vs run).           | Checklists are **criteria** used by `U.Evaluation`; executions live under `U.Work`.            |
| A‑6  | **Carrier identity**        | File path/version treated as “the spec itself.”                      | Identity drift; archival brittleness.     | Identity is the **KU**; `U.Carrier` is only an encoding (Sec. 5).                              |
| A‑7  | **Windowless verdict**      | Attestations omit time window.                                       | Unreproducible results; stale judgements. | Require **window** in attestation (IDS‑10).                                                    |
| A‑8  | **Over‑formal Description** | Description bloats into a standard; unreadable.                      | Violates didactics; blocks adoption.      | Enforce **one‑screen** discipline (IDS‑12); move exegesis to pedagogy.                         |
| A‑9  | **Spec without harness**    | “Shall” statements with no linked acceptance matrices.               | Unverifiable normativity.                 | Bind to **SCR/RSCR harness** (F.15) or downgrade to Description (IDS‑3).                       |
| A‑10 | **Global language leakage** | Description reads as universal definition rather than Context‑local. | Breaks locality; fuels conflicts.         | Prefix mentally with the Context; rewrite locally (IDS‑2).                                        |

## 9 · Worked examples (multi‑architheory, didactic)

> Each vignette shows **intension ↔ Description/Spec ↔ Evaluation** with **context‑local** wording. No workflows; only thinking moves.

### 9.1 Enactment (Role Assignment & Enactment line) — *Change Authority* role (ITIL 4 Context)

**Contexts.** `ITIL4_2020` (services/deontics), `PROV_O_2013` (run‑time traces).
**Intension.** `U.Role :: ChangeAuthority` — a behavioural mask that may be worn by a system (person/team/tool) to **authorise** a change.

**RoleDescription\@ITIL4.**

* **Tech/Plain.** *ChangeAuthority* / “change approver”.
* **RCS (characteristics).** CredentialLevel ∈ {L1,L2}; Scope ∈ {Service, Platform}; SeparationOfDuty ∈ {Clean, Violates}.
* **RSG (states).** `Proposed → Designated → Authorized → Active → Suspended → Revoked`.
* **State checklists (sketch).**

  * *Authorized:* { valid nomination, SoD=Clean, credential ≥ required, mandate window set }.
  * *Active:* *Authorized* ∧ { current shift/roster entry ∧ no conflicting active duty }.

**Evaluations.**
`U.Evaluation@ITIL4` over evidence (roster entries, mandate doc, SoD list, PROV Activities of approvals) yields **attestations**:

* `subject=Team‑X ∈ Authorized@ITIL4 in ⟨2025‑08‑01, 2025‑12‑31⟩`.
* Later, `subject=Team‑X ∈ Active@ITIL4 at 2025‑09‑14T10:05Z`.

**Didactic hooks.**

* The **role** is *characterised by* RCS/RSG in the **RoleDescription**; it **does not contain** them.
* The **attestation** is a statement about state‑in‑window; it does **not** mutate the role.

---

### 9.2 Method (Essence‑language Context) — *Backlog Refinement* method

**Contexts.** `OMG_Essence_Language_2023` (method language), `PROV_O_2013` (runtime).
**Intension.** `U.Method :: BacklogRefinement`.

**MethodDescription\@Essence.**

* **Tech/Plain.** *BacklogRefinement* / “tidy backlog”.
* **Inputs/Outputs (informative).** Work items (ideas) → clarified items (ready/not‑ready tags).
* **RCS (characteristics).** Cadence ∈ {weekly, continuous}; CollaborationMode ∈ {sync, async}.
* **RSG (states).** `Sketched → Defined → Adopted`.
* **State checklist (Adopted).** { team agreed practice note exists, cadence set, entry/exit criteria published }.

**Spec‑gate outcome.**
No acceptance harness yet → remains **MethodDescription**, **not** MethodSpec.

**Run‑time echo.**
`U.Work` instances (calendar sessions, chat threads) are traced in PROV; **Evaluation** can check whether an *Adopted* practice is being followed in window W without ever reifying the method as a workflow.

---

### 9.3 Service (SLO/SLA) — *Calibration Service* (ITIL 4 + SOSA/SSN Contexts)

**Contexts.** `ITIL4_2020` (service), `SOSA_SSN_2017` (observation), `ISO_80000_1_2022` (units).
**Intension.** `U.Service :: CalibrationService`.

**ServiceDescription\@ITIL4.**

* **Tech/Plain.** *CalibrationService* / “we calibrate your sensor”.
* **Acceptance facet (informative).** *SLO: error ≤ 0.5% FS under ISO 80000 units*; **formal criteria live in** ServiceSpec only if harness exists.

**Evaluation\@ITIL4+SOSA.**
Observations (SOSA) from test runs compared with thresholds → **ServiceEvaluation** attests *Met/Not‑Met* in a stated window.
No Cross‑context import: ISO units cited **as context‑local** references.

---

### 9.4 Epistemic (KD‑line) — *Evidence status vs role state*

**Contexts.** `PROV_O_2013` (provenance), `FPF_Evidence_Status` (status family).
**Intensions.** `U.KnowledgeUnit :: Report_42`; `U.EvidenceStatus :: SupportsClaim`.

**Separation.**

* `SupportsClaim@C` is a **status over a KU** (classifies the report).
* It is **not** a node of any role’s `U.RSG`.
* `U.Evaluation` produces `attestation(Report_42 has EvidenceStatus=SupportsClaim@C, W)`.

**Didactic point.**
State names in *role* graphs do not duplicate **statuses**; planes stay disjoint.

---

### 9.5 Control (Sys‑CAL line) — *Control‑Operator* role (IEC 61131‑3 Context)

**Contexts.** `IEC_61131_3` (control languages), `ISA_95` (integration).
**Intension.** `U.Role :: ControlOperator`.

**RoleDescription\@IEC61131‑3.**

* **RCS.** StationLevel ∈ {Cell, Line}; TaskMode ∈ {Cyclic, Event}; AlarmPrivileges ∈ {Ack, Ack+Shelve}.
* **RSG.** `Onboarded → Authorized → ConsoleActive → Paused → Suspended`.
* **Checklists (ConsoleActive).** { Authorized ∧ current console login ∧ task watchlist loaded }.

**Attestation (run‑time).**
`subject=Operator‑A ∈ ConsoleActive@IEC at 2025‑09‑14T08:00Z` based on log evidence.
No “workflow” required in the Description.

---

## 10 · Relations (with other patterns)

**Builds on:**

* **E.10.D1 — Lexical Discipline for “Context” (D.CTX).** Provides the *Context* primitive and bans “anchor” talk.
* **A.7 — Strict Distinction (Clarity Lattice).** This pattern concretises SD for intension vs description/spec vs carrier vs work.
* **C.2.3 — Unified Formality Characteristic (F).** Supplies the **F** anchors and **ΔF** moves that gate `…Spec`.

**Constrains:**

* **F.1–F.3 (Contexts → seeds → local senses).** Descriptions **must** cite context‑local senses (SenseCells) rather than global words.
* **F.4–F.5 (role/service naming).** Tech/Plain labels on Descriptions obey F.5 morphology rules.
* **F.8 (Service Acceptance Binding).** Evaluations of services read acceptance **from Description/Spec**, compare against Observations.
* **F.9 (Alignment & Bridge).** No Description/Spec may imply Cross‑context equivalence; Bridges carry all Cross‑context semantics.
* **F.15 (SCR/RSCR Harness).** Any `…Spec` must link to its harness; RSCR re‑checks verdict stability across editions/windows.

**Is used by.**

* **Part C architheories.** Sys‑CAL, KD‑CAL, Kind-CAL, Method‑CAL cite `…Description/…Spec` KUs explicitly and consume **state attestations** from `U.Evaluation`.
* **Part B trust calculus.** Uses the presence/absence of harnessed Specs and the windowed nature of attestations in confidence roll‑ups.

---

## 11 · Migration notes (conceptual refactor playbook)

> Goal: remove conflations and normalise names without changing underlying models.

1. **Rename by default.** Any `XSpec` lacking a bound acceptance harness becomes **`XDescription`**. Keep content intact; change suffix and preface with a “Description, not Spec” note.
2. **Promote selectively.** For KUs that *are* testable and declare **F ≥ F4**, add harness links (F.15) and re-label as **`XSpec`** via the Spec-gate.
3. **Fix the verbs.** Rewrite “Role contains RSG/RCS” → “Role is **characterised by** RSG/RCS in RoleDescription”.
4. **Detach carriers.** Replace identity‑by‑file with **`U.Carrier` encodes …Description/Spec** wording.
5. **Add Contexts.** Where a Description drifts globally (“the backlog refinement is…”), prefix with the Context and adjust wording to be **local**.
6. **Split planes.** Move any Evidence/Requirement **statuses** out of role state lists; keep them as roles over **knowledge units**.
7. **Window‑ise verdicts.** Ensure every evaluation statement adds an explicit **window** (instant or interval).
8. **Document maturity.** **Declare each Description’s F** (C.2.3) and track **ΔF** promotions/demotions as part of change notes (no governance implied).

---

## 12 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

### 12.1 Static conformance checks (SCR)

* **SCR-D2-S01 (Suffix discipline).** Every KU with suffix **–Spec** passes the **Spec-gate** (**F ≥ F4** ∧ testable invariants ∧ harness link ∧ Context named). Otherwise it bears **–Description**.
* **SCR‑D2‑S02 (Characterisation verbs).** Texts never say an intension “contains” RCS/RSG; they say it is **characterised by** them via the Description/Spec.
* **SCR‑D2‑S03 (Plane purity).** No KU mixes role **states** and knowledge **statuses**; each appears only on its correct plane.
* **SCR‑D2‑S04 (context‑locality).** Every Description/Spec names its `U.BoundedContext`; wording reads correctly when prefixed by the Context.
* **SCR‑D2‑S05 (Two registers).** Tech **and** Plain labels present on all Descriptions/Specs.
* **SCR‑D2‑S06 (Carrier separation).** Identity statements refer to KUs; files are referenced only as `U.Carrier` encodings.
* **SCR‑D2‑S07 (Windowed evaluation).** All state attestations cite a window `W` (instant or interval).

### 12.2 Regression checks (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑D2‑E01 (Spec demotion guard).** If a **–Spec** loses its harness or testability, it is demoted to **–Description**; diffs show no lingering “shall” claims.
* **RSCR‑D2‑E02 (Bridge drift).** If two Contexts begin to share identical labels, verify no Descriptions/Specs imply Cross‑context identity; add or revise **F.9 Bridges** instead.
* **RSCR‑D2‑E03 (Edition churn).** When a Context’s canon updates, previously valid attestations remain historical (windowed); new Specs/Descriptions cite the new edition.
* **RSCR‑D2‑E04 (Verb hygiene).** Automated grep over corpus finds “contains RSG/RCS” phrasing; none remain after refactor.
* **RSCR‑D2‑E05 (Status bleed).** Spot‑audit a random sample of role graphs to ensure no epistemic/deontic statuses appear as role states.

---

*Didactic takeaway.*
Think in three layers: **Intension** (what the thing *is*), **Description/Spec** (how we *state* its character and, when mature, *test* it), and **Evaluation** (what we can *attest* about it in a **window**). Keep Contexts local, planes separate, and “contains” out of your vocabulary.

## 13 · Author’s pocket guide (carry‑in‑mind rules)

> **Use these as thinking cues, not as paperwork.** Each cue is a one‑breath test you can apply while writing.

1. **Name the Context.** Write “*Role (ITIL4)*”, “*Method (Essence‑language)*”, “*Execution (PROV)*”. Never speak global words.
2. **Pick the *object-of-talk*.** Am I talking about an **intension** (Role/Method/Service), a **Description/Spec**, an **Evaluation**, or a **Carrier**? Stay on one object-of-talk per sentence.
3. **Prefer –Description.** Use **`…Description`** by default. Switch to **`…Spec`** only after the **Spec‑gate** (testable invariants + harness + F‑mode).
4. **Characterised by…** Say *“Role is **characterised by** RCS/RSG recorded in RoleDescription”*, never *“Role **contains** its states”*.
5. **Window every verdict.** An Evaluation must read “*X ∈ State\@context **in** W*”. No naked, timeless verdicts.
6. **Status ≠ state.** Role **states** live in `U.RSG`; Evidence/Requirement **statuses** classify **knowledge units**. Do not mix.
7. **Bridge later.** If two Contexts “feel the same”, write the itch down and leave it for **F.9 Bridge**.
8. **Two registers.** Every Description/Spec has **Tech** and **Plain** labels; prefer the shortest tech term that matches the invariants.
9. **Carrier humility.** Files and records are **Carriers** of Descriptions/Specs; they don’t *equal* the thing you reason about.
10. **Spec = test.** If you can’t point to a harness that would falsify it, it isn’t a **Spec** yet.

## 15 · Naming & alias policy (normative, notation‑free)

### 15.1 Suffix discipline (recap).**

* **Preferred default:** **`…Description`** for Role/Method/Service/Work.
* **Reserved:** **`…Spec`** only if the item passed the **Spec‑gate** (F‑mode, testable invariants, harness id, Context named).
* **Banned:** Using **–Spec** as a synonym for “detailed description”.

### 15.2 Canonical/alias map (current edition).**

| Concept (intension) | Preferred KU name      | Allowed alias (equal scope)   | Deprecated alias | Notes                                                                                 |

### **Pattern E.12 — Didactic Primacy & Cognitive Ergonomics \[A] 

**Context**

The FPF is designed as an "Operating System for Thought," a tool intended to augment and clarify human (and artificial) reasoning. This mission places a unique demand on its architecture: the framework's internal elegance and formal power are secondary to its primary function of being understandable and usable. A perfectly consistent but incomprehensible system fails in its didactic purpose. As formal mechanisms like `Assurance Levels` and epistemic scores are introduced, there is a significant risk that the pursuit of these metrics becomes an end in itself, overshadowing the ultimate goal of fostering clearer thought.

**Problem**

If the framework's design prioritizes theoretical purity or formal completeness over cognitive ergonomics, it becomes vulnerable to two critical failure modes:

1.  **Goodhart's Law:** When a measure (like `AssuranceLevel:L2`) becomes the primary target, it ceases to be a good measure of genuine understanding. Teams may start "gaming the metrics," producing artifacts that are formally perfect but conceptually shallow or pragmatically useless.
2.  **Cognitive Overload & Rejection:** The framework becomes so dense, jargon-laden, and procedurally complex that its users—the very agents it is meant to serve—either burn out or abandon it in favor of simpler, albeit less rigorous, methods. The "Operating System for Thought" devolves into a bureaucratic machine for certification.

**Forces**

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Formal Rigor vs. Human Usability** | How to build a system that is both formally sound and cognitively accessible, without sacrificing one for the other. |
| **Intrinsic Complexity vs. Incidental Complexity**| How to distinguish the necessary cognitive load inherent in solving a difficult problem from the unnecessary friction imposed by a poorly designed framework. |
| **Means vs. Ends** | How to ensure that the production of high-quality artifacts (the means) always serves the ultimate goal of enhancing an agent's cognitive capabilities (the end). |

**Solution**

FPF elevates **Didactic Primacy (Pillar P-2)** to a normative architectural principle, operationalized through two conceptual mechanisms designed to act as a permanent counterbalance to excessive formalism.

**1. The Principle of Didactic Primacy (Expanded Definition)**

The primary purpose of the FPF is to enhance the cognitive capabilities (`U.Capability`/`Mastery`) of an Agent (`U.Agent`) in service of its Objectives (`U.Objective`). The creation of artifacts with high assurance levels and epistemic scores is a *means to that end, not the end itself*. Any architectural decision that increases formal rigor at the cost of clarity or usability must be explicitly justified by a demonstrable gain in the agent's ability to reason effectively.

**2. Mechanism 1: The Rationale Mandate**

Every key assurance artifact (such as a `U.AssuranceCase` or `Proof`) **MUST** contain a mandatory, human-readable **`rationale`** component.

*   **Nature:** The `rationale` is not a technical description but a narrative explanation.
*   **Content:** It **MUST** answer the question: *"How does achieving this level of formal assurance tangibly help the agent better understand the problem or make a more reliable decision?"*
*   **Purpose:** This mandate forces a moment of reflection, formally linking the act of formalization back to its pragmatic, cognitive purpose. An empty or perfunctory rationale indicates that the assurance work may be an exercise in formalism for its own sake.

> **Didactic Note for Managers: The "So What?" Test**
>
> The Rationale Mandate is FPF's built-in "So What?" test. When your team presents a complex, formally verified artifact (`AssuranceLevel:L2`), the `rationale` is where they answer your fundamental question: "This is impressive, but *so what*? How does this help us ship a better product, make a smarter investment, or avoid a critical risk?" If the answer isn't clear and compelling in the `rationale`, the formal work may have been a waste of resources. It keeps your most brilliant minds focused on creating value, not just elegant proofs.

**3. Mechanism 2: The Human-Factor Loop (HF-Loop)**

To provide a continuous, self-correcting mechanism against cognitive overload, FPF introduces a conceptual feedback loop.

*   **Core Concept:** The HF-Loop is a formal method of inquiry designed to distinguish between the *essential complexity* of the problem being solved and the *incidental complexity* introduced by the FPF itself.
*   **Trigger Concept:** A review is triggered when the **subjective cognitive workload** associated with using the framework exceeds a conceptual threshold. This is not about performance metrics, but about the perceived mental effort required to use FPF's concepts and structures.
*   **Review Concept:** When triggered, a formal review is conducted by individuals in roles that specialize in human-centric perspectives, such as the **`Ethicist`** and **`UX Design Critic`**.
*   **Output Concept:** The review produces a set of proposed **conceptual simplifications** or **didactic improvements** to the framework's patterns or architheories. These are then submitted as formal change proposals (DRRs).

**Conformance Checklist**

*   **CC-E12.1 (Rationale Mandate):** Every `U.AssuranceCase` or `Proof` artifact at `AssuranceLevel:L2` **MUST** contain a non-empty `rationale` component that satisfies the "So What?" test.
*   **CC-E12.2 (HF-Loop Trigger Condition):** Each architheory that defines a significant workflow **SHOULD** specify a conceptual condition for triggering an HF-Loop review, based on the principle of managing cognitive load.
*   **CC-E12.3 (HF-Loop Review Mandate):** If a trigger condition is met, a review involving the designated human-centric roles **MUST** be initiated. Its outcome **MUST** be a documented set of conceptual refinement proposals.
*   **CC-E12.4 (Didactic Primacy in DRRs):** Any DRR proposing a change to a normative pattern **MUST** include a section analyzing its impact on cognitive ergonomics and didactic clarity.

**Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them**

| Anti-Pattern | Manager's View: What It Looks Like | How FPF Prevents It (Conceptually) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The "Ivory Tower" Framework** | The FPF specification becomes a beautiful but impenetrable fortress of abstract logic that no practicing engineer can actually use. | The **HF-Loop** provides a formal channel for user feedback to drive conceptual simplification. The roles of `UX Design Critic` and `Ethicist` are constitutionally empowered to challenge complexity that does not serve a clear purpose. |
| **The "Meaningless Rationale"** | The `rationale` field is filled with boilerplate text like "To increase assurance," without any real connection to the problem. | The "So What?" test is part of the review process for L2 artifacts. A perfunctory `rationale` is grounds for rejecting the artifact's promotion to L2, forcing the author to articulate the *real* value of their formal work. |
| **Glorifying Complexity** | A culture emerges where the most complex and difficult-to-understand models are considered the "best," regardless of their utility. | The core principle of **Cognitive Elegance (P-1)** and the mechanisms in this pattern create a constant pressure towards simplicity and clarity. The framework formally values understanding over mere complexity. |

**Consequences**

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Guards FPF's Core Mission:** This pattern acts as an "immune system," protecting the framework from devolving into sterile formalism and ensuring it remains a tool for enhancing thought. | **Introduces "Softer" Concepts:** Cognitive load and rationale quality are less quantifiable than formal proofs. *Mitigation:* FPF operationalizes them through a formal method. The HF-Loop is a structured inquiry, not an informal chat. |
| **Empowers Human-Centric Roles:** It gives the `Ethicist` and `UX Design Critic` roles a concrete, constitutional function in the evolution of the framework. | - |
| **Prevents User Burnout and Rejection:** The HF-Loop is an early warning system that detects when the framework is becoming too cumbersome, allowing for course correction before users become frustrated and abandon it. | - |
| **Creates a Self-Simplifying System:** The pattern creates a formal pressure that forces FPF to evolve towards greater clarity and usability, balancing the drive for formal rigor. | - |

**Rationale**

This pattern operationalizes **Didactic Primacy (P-2)**, transforming it from a philosophical statement into an enforceable architectural contract. The `Rationale Mandate` ensures that every act of formalization is tied to a clear purpose. The `Human-Factor Loop` ensures that the *cost* of using the framework is measured not just in resources, but in the most critical resource of all: the cognitive capacity of its users.

This pattern does not weaken the formal rigor established by other ADRs; it complements it. It guarantees that the powerful machinery of FPF is always directed towards a meaningful, human-relevant goal. It is the constitutional guarantee that FPF will remain, first and foremost, an "Operating System for Thought."

**Relations**

*   **Implements:** Pillar `P-2 Didactic Primacy`.
*   **Complements:** `E.13 Pragmatic Utility & Value Alignment` (which focuses on the relevance of the *problem*, while this pattern focuses on the usability of the *framework*).
*   **Is constrained by:** The overall governance process (DRRs), which is the vehicle for implementing the conceptual simplifications proposed by the HF-Loop.

### Pattern E.13 — Pragmatic Utility & Value Alignment \[A] 

**Context**

The FPF provides a powerful engine for constructing formally correct and highly reliable holons. This power, however, introduces a subtle but profound risk: a team can create a perfectly verified and validated artifact (`AssuranceLevel:L2`) that solves an irrelevant, misunderstood, or non-existent problem. The framework guarantees that the solution is *correct*, but it does not, by itself, guarantee that the solution is *useful*.

Furthermore, many of the most important system objectives—such as "safety," "usability," or "security"—are not directly measurable. They are assessed via **proxy characteristics** (e.g., "number of reported vulnerabilities" as a proxy for security). This practice is vulnerable to Goodhart's Law: when a proxy becomes the primary target, it often ceases to be a good measure of the original goal, as teams begin to optimize the proxy at the expense of the real objective.

**Problem**

Without a formal mechanism to keep the entire assurance apparatus tethered to real-world value, FPF risks enabling two critical failure modes:

1.  **Formalism for Formality's Sake:** Teams become preoccupied with achieving high epistemic scores, producing elegant but useless artifacts. The framework is used to build beautiful solutions to the wrong problems.
2.  **Proxy-Metric Distortion (Goodhart's Law):** Teams successfully optimize for a chosen proxy characteristic, but in doing so, they diverge from—or even actively undermine—the true, often qualitative, `U.Objective` that the proxy was intended to represent. The system becomes technically successful but pragmatically a failure.

**Forces**

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Measurability vs. Meaning** | How to use quantitative, measurable proxies for progress without losing sight of the qualitative, often un-measurable, goals that truly matter. |
| **Abstraction vs. Application** | How to build and reason with abstract models without them becoming disconnected from any concrete, practical application. |
| **Incremental Progress vs. Global Value** | How to ensure that local optimizations and incremental improvements are genuinely contributing to the overall value proposition of the holon. |

**Solution**

FPF elevates **Pragmatic Utility (Pillar P-7)** to a normative architectural principle, operationalized through two mandatory conceptual mechanisms.

**1. The Principle of Pragmatic Utility (Expanded Definition)**

Any artifact created within the FPF is an instrument for achieving a specific, pragmatic `U.Objective`. The value of an artifact is determined solely by its **utility** in achieving that objective, not by its epistemic scores in isolation.

**2. Mechanism 1: The Proxy-Audit Loop**

To formally manage the risk of Goodhart's Law, FPF introduces a conceptual feedback loop to periodically review the alignment between proxy characteristics and their intended goals.

*   **New Normative Relation:** A new relation, `isProxyFor: U.Characteristic → U.Objective`, is introduced. This relation **MUST** be used to explicitly declare when a measurable characteristic is serving as a proxy for a higher-level, often qualitative, goal.
*   **Conceptual Audit Process:** Any characteristic marked with the `isProxyFor` relation is subject to a **periodic conceptual audit**.
*   **Review Roles:** This audit is conceptually performed by the individual(s) in the **`Strategist`** role. They are tasked with answering the question: *"Is optimizing for this proxy still reliably driving progress toward the actual `U.Objective` it represents, or have we observed a divergence?"*
*   **Output Concept:** If a divergence is identified, a high-priority `U.Method` for revising or replacing the proxy **MUST** be proposed.

> **Didactic Note for Managers: Are You Climbing the Right Mountain?**
>
> The Proxy-Audit Loop is your compass. Your team's dashboards might show all green—metrics are improving, targets are being hit. But the audit loop forces a crucial question: "Are these the *right* metrics?"
>
> Imagine you are trying to improve "customer satisfaction" (`U.Objective`). You choose "average call handle time" as a proxy metric. Your team successfully drives this number down. But the Proxy-Audit reveals that customer satisfaction is actually *decreasing* because agents are rushing and providing poor service to meet the time target. The loop forces you to recognize this divergence and find a better proxy (e.g., "first-call resolution rate"). It ensures your team is not just climbing fast, but climbing the right mountain.

**3. Mechanism 2: The Minimally Viable Example (MVE) Mandate**

To enforce a pragmatic, value-first approach from the very beginning of a project, any new `U.System` or major system component **MUST** begin its development cycle with the creation of a **Minimally Viable Example (MVE)**.

*   **Definition:** An MVE is a simple, end-to-end, working instance of the holon that demonstrates the achievement of at least one core, user-facing objective, however trivial. It is the FPF equivalent of a "Hello, World" for a complex system.
*   **Assurance Requirement:** The MVE **MUST** achieve a minimum of **`AssuranceLevel:L1 (Substantiated)`**. This means the MVE cannot be a mere mock-up or a purely conceptual sketch; it must be supported by at least one piece of tangible evidence (e.g., a passing test case, a formal assertion), as defined in Pattern B.3.3.
*   **Stege transition Precedence:** The development of the full-scale holon cannot proceed to `AssuranceLevel:L2` until the MVE has been created and has met its L1 requirement.

**Conformance Checklist**

*   **CC-E13.1 (Proxy Declaration Mandate):** Any `U.Characteristic` used as a primary driver for an objective **MUST** be explicitly linked to that `U.Objective` via the `isProxyFor` relation.
*   **CC-E13.2 (Proxy-Audit Mandate):** A formal Proxy-Audit review **MUST** be conducted at regular conceptual intervals (e.g., before each major release). The outcome of this review **MUST** be a documented episteme.
*   **CC-E13.3 (MVE Mandate):** The development of any new `U.System` **MUST** be preceded by the creation of an MVE that satisfies the `AssuranceLevel:L1` requirement.
*   **CC-E13.4 (MVE Traceability):** The full-scale `U.System` **MUST** maintain a formal traceability link (`isEvolutionOf`) to its originating MVE.

**Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them**

| Anti-Pattern | Manager's View: What It Looks Like | How FPF Prevents It (Conceptually) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The "Perfectly Engineered Irrelevance"** | The team delivers a technically brilliant system that is formally verified and validated, but no one wants to use it because it doesn't solve a real problem. | **CC-E13.3** forces the team to build a working, end-to-end slice of value (the MVE) *first*. This grounds the entire project in a demonstrated solution to a real user need from day one. |
| **The "Metric Myopia"** | The team becomes obsessed with improving a specific KPI, ignoring clear signs that this is not improving—and may even be harming—the overall user experience or business goal. | **CC-E13.2** mandates the Proxy-Audit Loop. This forces a periodic, strategic step-back, where the `Strategist` role is constitutionally required to ask, "Are we still measuring what matters?" |
| **The "Big Design Up Front" Trap** | The team spends months creating a vast, abstract, and highly detailed model of a system before ever building a single working component. | The **MVE Mandate** prevents this. It forces an iterative, pragmatic "build-to-learn" approach, ensuring that models are always grounded in a working reality. |

**Consequences**

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Defense Against Goodhart's Law:** The Proxy-Audit Loop is a concrete, operational defense against the common failure mode of optimizing for the wrong thing. It forces regular, strategic reflection on the meaning of metrics. | **Introduces Strategic Overhead:** The Proxy-Audit Loop and the creation of an MVE require dedicated time for strategic thinking and early implementation. *Mitigation:* This is not an expense but a strategic investment. This upfront effort is designed to prevent the far greater cost of developing the wrong system over months or years. |
| **Ensures Value-Driven Development:** The MVE Mandate guarantees that all major development efforts are grounded in a demonstrated, working solution to a real problem, however small. This prevents teams from investing significant resources in abstract models that have no proven path to practical application. | - |
| **Prevents "Analysis Paralysis":** By requiring an early, working example, this principle encourages an iterative, pragmatic development style. It forces teams to build and learn, rather than over-specifying in a vacuum. | - |
| **Positions FPF as an Engineering Discipline:** This pattern firmly anchors FPF as a tool for practical engineering, not just theoretical modeling. | - |

**Rationale**

This pattern operationalizes **Pragmatic Utility (P-7)**. While Pattern E.12 protects the *agent* from the cognitive overload of the framework, this pattern protects the *problem* from being lost in a sea of formal abstraction. It provides the necessary constitutional guardrails to keep the powerful formal methods of FPF focused on delivering tangible, real-world value.

The **MVE Mandate** ensures that every journey starts with a destination in sight. The **Proxy-Audit Loop** ensures that the compass used on that journey remains pointed in the right direction. Together, these mechanisms guarantee that knowledge generated within FPF is not only formally correct and epistemically reliable, but also meaningful, useful, and aligned with its intended purpose.

**Relations**

*   **Implements:** Pillar `P-7 Pragmatic Utility`.
*   **Complements:** `E.12 Didactic Primacy & Cognitive Ergonomics`.
*   **Provides context for:** The definition of `U.Objective` and `U.Characteristic` by establishing a formal link between them.

# **E.14 · Human‑Centric Working‑Model** \[A]

### 1  Intent

Establish a **single, human‑centric Working‑Model** that practitioners can read, discuss, and evolve **without exposure to formal machinery**.  
Each statement **declares a justification stance** (`validationMode`) and, when assurance is sought, attaches **appropriate grounding** via one or more assurance shoulders — **Mapping**, **Logical**, **Constructive** — and **may additionally attach Empirical Validation** (evidence) as defined by the Trust & Assurance calculus. Empirical Validation can accompany any stance; it is **required** when the stance is *postulate*. Assurance shoulders sit **beneath** the Working‑Model and **never define its vocabulary**.
 
+Put bluntly: *one model people work in; three assurance shoulders — plus empirical checks when the world is the judge.*

### 2  Problem & Context

+Teams need **one shared Working‑Model** to make decisions at speed. Historically this surface either:

* **drifts into jargon**—different terms for the same thing, slash‑labels, partial overlaps; or
* **calcifies into machinery**—too formal for day‑to‑day design and review.

Both failure modes create friction between two audiences:
(1) **working users** (engineers, programme managers, policy owners) who need a **small, stable surface**, and
(2) **assurance authors** (ontologists, methodologists, auditors) who need **proofs that the surface is sound**.

E.14 resolves the impasse by **separating concerns**:

* A **Working‑Model layer**: curated kinds and relations expressed in plain terms, governed by simple human rules.
* A **three‑rung Assurance stack** beneath it—**Mapping**, **Logical**, **Constructive**—that carries the heavy arguments (concept alignment, relational semantics, generative traces) and **never leaks back** into the Working‑Model narrative.

This pattern dovetails with the framework’s unification stance (**small Working‑Model surface, rigorous foundations**) and with our constructional mereology commitments (**sum/set/slice** provide extensional identity), while keeping the Kernel minimal and meta‑only.

### 3  Forces

1. **Cognitive economy vs. semantic precision.**
   Managers and engineers must navigate with a handful of names and relations; assurance authors must still certify that those names and relations **are unambiguous and extensional**.

2. **Speed of change vs. guarantees.**
   The Working‑Model must accommodate rapid iteration; the Assurance stack must **lag just enough** to check, without blocking practical progress.

3. **Parsimony vs. expressivity.**
   The Working‑Model should **not proliferate relation types or ad‑hoc categories**; fine‑grained distinctions live in the Assurance layers and are surfaced **only when they materially change a decision**.

4. **Downward grounding vs. upward contamination.**
   Grounding must always flow **down** (Working‑Model → Mapping → Logical → Constructive). No dependence **up** is allowed: proofs and traces never dictate wording or layout in the Working‑Model.

5. **Trans‑disciplinary unification vs. local dialects.**
   The Working‑Model must reconcile different disciplines’ habits **without erasing them**; Mapping captures dialects, while the Working‑Model exposes a **single usable choice**.

6. **Auditability vs. readability.**
   Every Working‑Model statement must be **auditable on request**, yet day‑to‑day views **hide the scaffolding** unless summoned.

---

### 4  Solution 

#### 4.1 Human-Centric principles

> **E.14‑P.1 – Working‑Model first, stance explicit.**  
> Operate one **Working‑Model** for all human‑facing discussion. For **each** assertion, the author **SHALL declare** a justification stance (`validationMode`) and choose the **appropriate assurance shoulder(s)**: **Mapping** (term↔kind alignment via **Lang‑CHR** / D‑Projection), **Logical** (CT2R alias semantics, scope/constraints), **Constructive** (Γₘ generative trace), and **Empirical Validation** (evidence via `U.EvidenceRole` in a declared `U.BoundedContext`).

> **E.14‑P.2 – Downward‑only dependency.**
> Information **may** flow from the Working‑Model down into any Assurance layer; **no Assurance layer may impose vocabulary or shape back upward** into the Working‑Model.
>
> **E.14‑P.3 – Small surface, big proof.**
> The Working‑Model exposes a **minimal set** of names (L‑1/L‑2 registers) and **a compact family of relations** used in everyday reasoning; precision and completeness are **proved below**.

> **E.14‑P.4 – Human registers first.**
> Terms in the Working‑Model are deliberately curated for **human legibility** (register‑badged, synonym‑aware). Synonym capture and language variance belong to Mapping; **only the chosen canonical label appears on the Working‑Model surface**.

> **E.14‑P.5 – Justification modes are explicit.**  
> Each Working‑Model relation **declares** `validationMode ∈ {axiomatic, inferential, postulate}`.  
> _axiomatic_ → **Constructive** grounding (Γₘ trace via `tv:groundedBy`); _inferential_ → **Logical** grounding (reasoned chain, often KD‑CAL‑backed for epistemic ties); _postulate_ → **Empirical Validation** (evidence bundle with scope and timespan). Empirical Validation (**LA**) may also accompany _inferential_ or _axiomatic_ claims as real‑world confirmation. **Mapping** contributes **TA**, **Logical/Constructive** contribute **VA**, and **Empirical** contributes **LA** (per the Trust & Assurance calculus; no calculus variables appear on the Working‑Model surface).

> **E.14‑P.6 – Parsimony at the surface.**
> No new Working‑Model relation types are introduced if the existing Logical aliases plus Constructive grounding suffice to capture the intended meaning.

> **E.14‑P.7 – Evidence is a first‑class support.**  
> When *postulate* is chosen, authors **SHALL** attach an **evidence pointer** (Empirical Validation) appropriate to the claim and context, governed by `U.EvidenceRole` within a declared `U.BoundedContext`.  
 
### 5  Layer Contract & Downward Flow (Working‑Model → Assurance)

This section defines **what each layer is for**, **what it guarantees**, and **how a single Working‑Model statement is carried down**.

#### 5.1  Working‑Model (what humans see)

**Purpose.** A small, curated graph of kinds and relations that a mixed team can read at a glance.

**Elements.**

* **Kinds** — one **chosen concept** per node (no slash‑labels).
* **Relations** — a short list intelligible to non‑specialists (e.g., *Component‑of*, *Member‑of*, *Aspect‑of*, plus a small number of cross‑disciplinary ties such as *Interface‑of* or *Constituent‑of*).
* **Language register badges** — terms appearing on the surface are L‑1 or L‑2; L‑3/L‑4 remain in Mapping as synonyms or symbols.

**Obligations.**

* Every Working‑Model edge and node is **grounded downward** (see below).
* The Working‑Model **does not display** constructor jargon, proof terminology, or evidence identifiers; those live in Assurance and are **callable on demand**.

#### 5.2  Assurance‑1: Mapping (from words to kinds)

**Role.** Consolidate human labels from varied sources and **bind them to the chosen kinds** used on the Working‑Model.

**Guarantee.** For any Working‑Model label, there exists a **stable alignment** to exactly one kind; synonyms, abbreviations, locales and registers are recorded here, **not** on the surface. Mapping primarily raises **Typing Assurance (TA)** by consolidating synonyms/registers and binding tokens/labels to **one chosen kind**; calculus‑level metrics live outside Part E.

**Deliverable.** A compact alignment table per scope that makes it obvious which **one label** the Working‑Model will show and which alternatives are tolerated in background sources.

*(Rationale: Working teams speak many dialects; the Working‑Model speaks one. Mapping is the interpreter.)*

#### 5.3  Assurance‑2: Logical (from Working‑Model relations to alias semantics)

**Role.** Give each Working‑Model relation **a precise alias meaning** and **its admissible use‑cases**, keeping the surface vocabulary small.

**Guarantee.** A Working‑Model edge such as *Component‑of* or *Aspect‑of* **carries one intended reading** (transitivity/antisymmetry expectations, scope notes), sufficient for auditors to assess whether the **use is legitimate** in a given context.

**Deliverable.** A short set of alias rules: “When an edge is labeled *Component‑of* at the surface, it intends the structural reading that is later verified by construction.” The Logical layer is **the contract** that ties human labels to accepted meanings (CT2R alias rules); it primarily contributes **Verification Assurance (VA)**. Calculus‑level symbols are not used in E‑patterns.

*(Rationale: logical aliasing protects the small surface from relation proliferation while keeping meanings crisp.)*

#### 5.4  Assurance‑3: Constructive (from meanings to generative traces)

**Role.** Provide **extensional guarantees** by **constructing** the wholes, collections, and slices that Working‑Model relations speak about.

**Guarantee.** For structural edges, **there exists a constructional narrative** (e.g., *sum*, *set*, *slice*) that, if told, would recreate the whole from its parts or the aspect from its bearer; this makes identity and containment **trackable and testable** across scales.

**Deliverable.** A **single generative story** per structural link (axiomatic justification). For non-structural ties on the surface (e.g., epistemic links), Constructive may be absent; Logical/Empirical take the lead. Constructive contributes **VA** (extensional identity via Γₘ); for **structural** edges, `tv:groundedBy` **MUST** reference exactly one Γₘ trace.

*(Rationale: constructional grounding turns everyday part‑whole talk into statements whose identity conditions are not left to taste.)*

#### 5.5  Assurance‑4: Empirical Validation (from claims to observed world)

**Role.** Record when and where a Working‑Model claim meets reality.  
**Guarantee.** Every empirical binding names a **`U.BoundedContext`**, a **target claim/scope**, and a **timespan**; **staleness/refresh** are managed per context policy.  
**Deliverable.** A `U.EvidenceRole` binding (status‑only) anchored into the Evidence–Provenance chain. Empirical Validation contributes **LA** (raises empirical **R** and constrains **G** to its validated envelope).

#### 5.6  The downward grounding for a single surface statement

Consider a Working‑Model arrow **A –Component‑of→ B**:

1. **Mapping** shows that the words *A* and *B* are the chosen labels for their kinds; it retains tolerated synonyms and symbols in the background.
2. **Logical** confirms that **Component‑of** on the surface means the **structural reading** with its ordinary mereological expectations; if the surface used *Member‑of* instead, Logical would similarly certify the intended reading and its boundaries.
3. **Constructive** exhibits the **constructional narrative** (e.g., a _sum_ of parts resulting in **B** with **A** among them), which yields **axiomatic justification** for the structural edge, sets `validationMode=axiomatic`, and binds the edge via **`tv:groundedBy → Γₘ.sum|set|slice`**.
4. **Empirical Validation** records the **evidence pointer** and scope that make the claim auditable within its `U.BoundedContext` (required for *postulate*; optional reinforcement for other stances).

Together, these three **ground the human arrow without leaking their machinery upward**. The Working‑Model remains simple; the Assurance stack carries the proof.

### 6 · Archetypal Grounding *(System / Episteme)*

> **Tell–Show–Show.** The principle is stated once, then shown on a `U.System` case (structural) and on a `U.Episteme` case (knowledge‑bearing), in line with the authoring template.

**6.1 · `U.System` — Working‑Model first, Constructive grounding available**

* **Publication (Working‑Model).** Authors state structure using familiar relations (e.g., *Impeller* **ut\:ComponentOf** *Pump*; *Pump* **ut\:ComponentOf** *Skid*). Nothing else is required for readers to follow the design.
* **Assurance (downward grounding).** When stronger assurance is sought, the same author **narrates** the constructive story of the whole as a composition of parts and, where appropriate, attaches a downward grounding to that narrative (sum / set / slice). The narrative remains concept‑level and notation‑neutral; order and time stay out of structure and are expressed in their own planes.
* **Canonization move.** Readers continue to see Working‑Model relations as the primary surface; the constructive story is *supporting*, not *defining*.

**6.2 · `U.Episteme` — Working‑Model first; Logical/Mapping preferred; Empirical evidence as appropriate**

* **Publication (Working‑Model).** Authors connect meaning‑bearing artefacts using knowledge relations (e.g., **RepresentationOf**, **UsageOf**) in the same human‑oriented style.
* **Assurance (downward grounding).** Here assurance typically flows to the **Logical** or **Mapping** shoulders (reasoned argument; type/lexical alignment). **Empirical Validation** is used where observation is the right currency (status‑only roles on epistemes); Constructive grounding is optional and used only where a structural interpretation is genuinely intended.
* **Canonization move.** Again, Working‑Model text is the public form; assurance is attached deliberately and separately, without leaking method or time semantics into structure.

**6.3 · Pattern lesson (both cases)**
The **Working‑Model layer remains the canonical publication surface** for authors and reviewers; **assurance layers** (Mapping / Logical / Constructive) are **opt‑in** and used purposefully, with grounding flowing **downwards** from the Working‑Model to the appropriate shoulder. This presentation respects the authoring template’s *Archetypal Grounding* requirement and keeps notational choices illustrative rather than defining.

| **CC‑E14‑1 (Working‑Model primacy).**      | Authors **SHALL** publish claims in **Working‑Model** form (human‑oriented **ut:\*Of** relations or equivalent domain statements) as the canonical surface for readers.          | Preserve human‑first canon and didactic clarity.              |
|**CC‑E14‑2 (Downward grounding).** | When assurance is attached, grounding **SHALL** flow **downwards** from the Working‑Model to the appropriate assurance shoulder (**Mapping / Logical / Constructive / Empirical**) and **SHALL NOT** impose vocabulary back onto the Working‑Model. | Maintain plane separation and cognitive economy. |
| **CC‑E14‑3 (Stance declaration).**         | For any claim where assurance matters, the author **SHALL** declare `validationMode` (*postulate / inferential / axiomatic*).                                                    | Make assurance intent explicit and readable.                  |
| **CC‑E14‑4 (No order/time in structure).** | Authors **SHALL NOT** encode execution order, parallelism, or temporal coverage as part–whole; keep them adjacent in their own planes.                                           | Prevent layer leakage and category errors.                    |

| **CC‑E14‑7 (Layer direction).**            | Authors **SHALL** avoid back‑defining Working‑Model terms by their assurance artefacts; dependence is one‑way (Working‑Model → Assurance).                                       | Preserve unidirectional dependence of layers.                 |

| **CC‑E14‑11 (Empirical bindings).**        | When `validationMode=postulate` (or when adding real‑world confirmation), authors **SHALL** bind evidence via `U.EvidenceRole` in a declared `U.BoundedContext` with an explicit **timespan** and provenance anchors. | Aligns with Evidence Anchoring and empirical ageing policies. |
| **CC-E14-12 (F-declaration).**             | Normative Working-Model artefacts **SHALL** declare `U.Formality = Fk` per **C.2.3** (**recommended F ≥ F3** for readable surfaces). Assurance artefacts **MAY** carry higher F; **min-F** applies to composites. | Aligns E.14 with the unified Formality characteristic; avoids legacy “tiers/modes”. |

*All obligations above are **conceptual** and apply to thought and prose; they introduce no notational or data‑processing requirements.*

**E — Conceptual Examples (no notation, no data handling)**

1. **Assembly from parts → “Component Of”**
   A pump skid is agreed to be nothing over and above its pump, frame, reservoir, and valve set considered together. Because the whole is conceptually *constructed* from those parts, the team may safely speak of each part as *Component Of* the skid. The justification is the construction itself: if any listed part were removed, the very same skid would no longer exist as that whole. This keeps identity extensional and makes the engineer‑facing alias (“Component Of”) truthful rather than conventional.

2. **Parallel elements gathered → “Member Of”**
   A test rig has four identical cartridges used in parallel. The rig treats them as a conceptual *gathering*; membership is fixed by inclusion in that gathering, not by sequence or timing. Speaking of each cartridge as *Member Of* the rig’s cartridge bank is then licensed by the same gathering act. Engineers can keep saying “member,” while architects know the warrant is the underlying construction of the bank as a collection, not an accidental tagging.

3. **Focused facet carved → “Aspect Of”**
   When the team talks about the *thermal envelope* of a reactor, they are not multiplying entities; they are taking the already‑agreed reactor and conceptually *carving out* its thermal facet for focused reasoning. Calling that carve‑out an *Aspect Of* the reactor is justified because the aspect owes its identity to the parent and the chosen facet, and nothing else. This licenses disciplined talk about “boundary,” “interface,” or “envelope” without mistaking them for independent systems.

> **Notes across the examples**
> • Everyday aliases (*Component Of, Member Of, Aspect Of*) remain the only labels engineers need to see; their truth is anchored by prior constructional choices.  
> • Structural links draw on **Constructive** grounding; **epistemic links**—like “Representation Of” or “Usage Of”—may instead rely on **Empirical Validation** (evidence bundles) or **Logical** grounding appropriate to the claim.  

**F — Resulting Context (after you apply the pattern)**

**What improves**

* **Single dial for containment.** Teams can ask one plain question—“what is inside what?”—and trust that all structural talk reduces to shared constructional choices rather than ad‑hoc relation lists. Ontologists keep rigorous warrants without burdening day‑to‑day readers.
* **Extensional identity by default.** Wholes are the wholes they are because of the parts gathered; collections are the collections they are because of their members; aspects inherit identity from their parent and facet. This prevents silent drift when labels change.
* **Layer harmony.** Engineer‑facing aliases live at the same level as other relation names, while their warrants live one step below, keeping human language clean and the generative basis auditable.

**What to watch**

* **Discipline at the structural tier.** A structural link that lacks a constructional warrant is conceptually unsafe. Conversely, forcing epistemic links to pretend they are structural over‑physicalises knowledge claims; for those, evidence or argument is the right currency.
* **Author workload moves, not grows.** Day‑to‑day model authors stay with aliases; specification authors carry the burden of ensuring every structural statement really follows from a sum, a gathering, or a carve‑out. This is a conscious shift of complexity away from operations and into the pattern’s foundation.

**Invariants you must preserve**

* **Parsimony of constructors.** Build wholes by summing parts; build banks by gathering elements; focus facets by carving aspects. Do not invent extra generative acts for parallelism or time‑slicing; those concerns belong to other conceptual services.
* **Two‑tier justification.** Structural talk rides on construction; epistemic talk rides on evidence or proof. Keep the boundary sharp so that later reasoning (about reliability, compliance, or policy) remains clear.

**Known consequences**

* **Stable queries, fewer surprises.** Because aliases are backed by shared constructions, teams from different disciplines can interoperate without renegotiating meanings at hand‑off.
* **Audit trail without jargon.** Reviewers can trace every structural claim to a prior constructional choice, while everyday collaborators keep using familiar relation names.

| **Human‑first clarity.** Readers see the **Working‑Model layer** as the canonical publication form; Assurance layers remain optional and purpose‑driven.      | **Extra author discipline.** Declaring the stance and (when needed) a short grounding narrative takes effort; mitigated by the authoring template and style guide.           |
| **Progressive assurance.** Teams can start light and raise strictness deliberately (Mapping → Logical → Constructive) without changing the visible relations. | **Risk of “forever‑light.”** Some models may remain in low‑assurance stances; mitigated by the formal maturity ladder and reviewer prompts to escalate where risk warrants.  |
| **Layer hygiene.** Order/time remain outside mereology; structural identity is neither overloaded nor diluted.                                                | **Split attention.** Authors must learn to keep planes distinct; mitigated by the Tell‑Show‑Show pedagogy across `[A]` patterns.                                             |
| **Spec cohesion.** The same section order and safety subsections (Bias‑Annotation, Conformance Checklist) keep patterns comparable and auditable.             | **Tighter prose.** Patterns grow by a few concise checks; mitigated by the canonical template.                                                                               |

> **Quotable closer.** *“One layer to speak, three layers to justify—only when needed.”*

## 10 · Rationale

**Why Working‑Model is canonical.** FPF privileges **human‑oriented relations** as the primary interface for thinking and communication. This satisfies didactic primacy while preserving conceptual integrity: formal work serves the human layer, not the other way around. The canonical template and style principles institutionalise this choice without inviting notation lock‑in.

**Why grounding flows downward.** Mapping, Logical, Constructive, and Empirical supports are **assurance shoulders** that sit *beneath* the Working‑Model claim. Authors select the shoulder(s) that fit purpose and risk: type/lexical alignment (**TA**), reasoned consequence (**VA**), constructive reconstruction (**VA**), and real‑world confirmation (**LA**). This keeps the Kernel small, avoids plane‑mixing, and provides a clear path to stronger guarantees when warranted.

**Why patterns teach before they tighten.** The Tell‑Show‑Show requirement couples each universal rule with System/Episteme illustrations, reducing cognitive load and preventing premature formalism. It is the didactic mechanism that makes Human‑Centric Canonization practical across disciplines.

**Why no notation talk in Core.** Guard‑rails and the style guide prohibit tool jargon and notation dependence inside normative prose; meanings are given in words and mathematics, with any renderings treated as illustrative only. This preserves longevity and cross‑disciplinary portability.

### **Part F — The Unification Suite (U‑Suite): Concept‑Sets, SenseCells & Contextual Role Assignment**

#### Cluster F.I — context of meaning & Raw Material

# **F.0.1 — Contextual Lexicon Principles** \[A]

> **One‑sentence summary.** All meanings in FPF are **local to a `U.BoundedContext`** (“Context of meaning”); terms are **spoken with their Context**, and any relation **across Contexts** exists **only** as an explicit **Alignment Bridge** with stated loss/fit.

**Status.** Architectural pattern \[A], architheory‑agnostic.
**Builds on:** A.1.1 `U.BoundedContext` (formal frame); A.7 *Strict Distinction* (C‑6); A.8 *Universal Core* (C‑1); A.11 *Ontological Parsimony* (C‑5); A.4 *Temporal Duality* (C‑7); **E.10.D1 D.CTX** (lexical discipline for “Context”).
**Coordinates with.** **F.1** (Context Map via Context Cards), **F.2** (local term capture), **F.3** (intra‑Context clustering), **F.7** (Concept‑Set Table), **F.9** (Alignment & Bridge), **B.3** (Trust & Assurance; CL penalties).

> **Didactic note.** In the Tech register, **Context ≡ `U.BoundedContext`** (per E.10.D1). We use “Context of meaning” as a **metaphor only**; *Context* remains the normative short form for `U.BoundedContext`. The word **anchor** is not used in FPF.

> **Didactic note.** In the Tech register, **Context ≡ `U.BoundedContext`** (per E.10.D1). We use “Context of meaning” as a **metaphor only**; *Context* remains the normative short form for `U.BoundedContext`. The word **anchor** is not used in FPF. The word *plane* is reserved to **CHR:ReferencePlane** only.

**Terminology guard (normative, Part F).** The **row classifier** is **senseFamily**: {Role | Status | Measurement | Type‑structure | Method | Execution}. **Characteristic** (MM‑CHR) names measurable aspects only (A.17–A.19) and MUST NOT be used for row typing in Part F. Avoid the generic word **facet** in Part F; when unavoidable, reference **C.3.5 KindAT (informative facet)** or **Compose‑CAL `U.Facet`** explicitly. Only **CHR:ReferencePlane** is permitted (no bare “plane”); use **I/D/S layer** for intension/description/specification; use **stance** for design vs run.

## 1 · Problem Frame

Trans‑disciplinary modelling fails without an explicit discipline for **where words mean what**.

* **Semantic drift.** The same string (“process”, “role”, “service”) slides between domains and editions.
* **Homonym collisions.** One label carries incompatible senses across fields.
* **Hidden synonymy.** Different labels point to the same local sense, but the identity is unstated.
* **Implicit globalism.** Meaning is treated as universal; integration silently re‑writes models.

FPF resolves this by **localising** meaning first, then **explicitly translating** across locales.

---

## 2 · The Three Principles (normative)

### P‑S · **Source Localisation Principle** — *Speak with the Context.*

**Rule.** Every term in a normative FPF artefact **MUST** be bound to a **specific `U.BoundedContext`** (its “Context of meaning”). The binding is explicit in text, notation, or table headers (e.g., **process (BPMN 2.0)**).

**Implications.**

* No free‑floating “global terms”.
* A finite **Context Map** (see **F.1**) is chosen **before** naming work starts.
* If a source intrinsically fixes time stance, the **design/run tag** is carried by the Context (C‑7).

**Reasoning move (conceptual).**
`Context(C) ∧ says(C, term t) ⊢ usable(t@C)`

**Illustration (Enactment line).**
`activity @ PROV‑O (run)` vs `task @ IEC 61131‑3 (run)` vs `process @ BPMN 2.0 (design)`.

---

### P‑L · **Local Meaning Principle** — *Meaning lives inside the Context.*

**Rule.** The **intended sense** of a term is established **inside its Context** as a **SenseCell**: a small, reconstructible unit of local meaning with **Tech/Plain labels** and a concise gloss. SenseCells are **lexical only** (C‑6): no behaviours, no deontics, no equations.

**Implications.**

* SenseCells are **Context‑scoped**; they do **not** cross Contexts.
* Minimal generality (G‑1) and contextual specification (G‑2) govern naming inside the Context.
* **Intra‑Context clustering** of raw mentions precedes any Cross‑context act (see **F.3**).

**Reasoning move (conceptual).**
`usable(t@C) ∧ fits(gloss, C) ⊢ SenseCell⟨t@C⟩`

**Illustration (KD‑CAL).**
`observation @ SOSA/SSN`: Tech “observation”, Plain “measurement act”; gloss “Result‑bearing act applying a Procedure…”.

---

### P‑B · **Explicit Bridge Principle** — *across Contexts, only with a bridge.*

**Rule.** Any relation between terms from **different** Contexts **MUST** be stated as an **Alignment Bridge** (see **F.9**): a named mapping between **SenseCell⟨·⟩** items with a declared **relation kind** (e.g., *overlaps*, *broader‑than*, *near‑equivalent*) and a **Congruence Level (CL)** for trust calculus (B.3).

**Implications.**

* No by‑name identity across Contexts; **string equality ≠ sense equality**.
* Bridges carry **loss/fit notes** and are auditable; they can be revised by edition.
* Concept‑Sets (F.7) are built **from bridged cells**, not from surface strings.

## 3 · Minimal Artefacts (conceptual, notationally neutral)

> These artefacts are **thought‑objects**; they specify **what must exist conceptually**, not how it is stored.

### 3.1 **Context Card** (for each `U.BoundedContext`)

A terse descriptor used in the **Context Map** (F.1):

* `id` (stable local handle) · `title` · `edition/year`
* `family` (discipline family; informal) · `scope gist`
* `timeStance?` (`design` / `run`, if inherent)
* `trip‑wires` (few lexical caveats that often mislead, e.g., “*process*≠thermo process”)

### 3.2 **SenseCell** (unit of local meaning, inside one context)

* `label.tech` / `label.plain` (two registers)
* `gloss` (minimal generality, Context‑true)
* `notes?` (warnings, edition shifts)
* **No** behaviour/deontics/equations (C‑6)

> **Where it comes from.** F.2 describes how SenseCells can be *derived* from local term evidence; F.0.1 only **requires** that local meaning be expressible as a SenseCell.

### 3.3 **Alignment Bridge** (between SenseCells from different Contexts)

* `left: SenseCell⟨·@A⟩`, `right: SenseCell⟨·@B⟩`
* `relation` (e.g., *equivalent‑under‑assumptions*, *overlaps*, *broader‑than*)
* `CL` (Congruence Level; feeds B.3 Trust & Assurance)
* `loss/fit` (explicit statement of what is lost or assumed)

---

## 4 · Invariants (normative)

1. **I‑1 · Context‑qualified usage.** Every normative use of a term is **Context‑qualified** (directly or via table/section headers).
2. **I‑2 · Local‑only cells.** A SenseCell belongs to **exactly one** Context.
3. **I‑3 · senseFamily hygiene.** SenseCells are **lexical**; behaviour, deontics, measurements, proof steps live in their respective architheories (C‑6). 
4. **I‑4 · Time stance fidelity.** If a source fixes `design/run`, the Context Card **carries** it and SenseCells **inherit** it.
5. **I‑5 · No implicit Cross‑context identity.** Cross‑context relations exist **only** as F.9 Bridges with `relation` and `CL`.
6. **I‑6 · Parsimony & heterogeneity hook.** The Context Map is **finite**, **heterogeneous** (≥ 3 families per unification line), and **parsimonious** (F.1).

---

## 5 · Reasoning Primitives (judgement schemata; pure, side‑effect‑free)

*These capture **allowable mental moves**; they do not prescribe storage, APIs, or workflow.*

* **Context qualification**
  `Context(C) ∧ mentions(C, s) ⊢ uses(s@C)`
  *Reading:* If a string *s* is used under Context *C*, we treat it as the local term *s\@C*.

* **Local sense formation**
  `uses(t@C) ∧ gloss_C(t) ⊢ SenseCell⟨t@C⟩`
  *Reading:* A Context‑true gloss yields a SenseCell for *t* inside *C*.

* **Admissible Cross‑context relation**
  `SenseCell⟨x@A⟩ ∧ SenseCell⟨y@B⟩ ∧ declare(rel, CL) ⊢ Bridge(x@A, y@B, rel, CL)`
  *Reading:* Only an explicit declaration generates a Bridge; no name‑matching inferences.

* **Bridge‑to‑Concept‑Set hint** *(for F.7)*
  `Bridge(x@A, y@B, rel≈equiv, CL≥k) ⊢ candidate_same_row(x, y)`
  *Reading:* Strong, near‑equivalence bridges can *nominate* cells for one Concept‑Set row (final decision in F.7).

---

## 6 · Didactic Metaphor (informative)

* **Contexts.** Each `U.BoundedContext` is a **Context**; its **Context Card** is a sign on the door (name, edition, time stance, trip‑wires).
* **Words in a Context.** A **SenseCell** is a dictionary entry pinned to that Context’s wall.
* **Door‑to‑door links.** An **Alignment Bridge** is a labelled passage connecting two Contexts; a **CL** placard says how trustworthy that passage is.

> *We first speak inside Contexts; only then decide which doors to connect—and with what warnings.*

---

## 7 · Placement & Flow

**F.0.1** is the **front door** of Part F. It enables:
**F.1** (choosing Contexts with Context Cards) → **F.2** (deriving SenseCells inside each Context) → **F.3** (stabilising local senses) → **F.7** (building Concept‑Set rows) → **F.9** (stating Bridges).

## 8 · Anti‑patterns & remedies

| #       | Anti‑pattern (what goes wrong)   | Symptom in models                                          | Why harmful (conceptual)                            | Remedy (this pattern’s clause)                                                            |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A1**  | **Global term** (Contextless usage) | “process”, “service”, “role” used without a Context mark      | Meaning drifts; integration silently rewrites sense | **P‑S**: Always speak **term\@context**; qualify via section/table headers if repeated       |
| **A2**  | **String‑match identity**        | Equating *service* (ITIL) with *service* (web‑API) by name | String equality ≠ sense equality                    | **P‑B**: Cross‑context relations exist only as **Bridges** with `relation`+`CL`              |
| **A3**  | **senseFamily mixing in SenseCell**    | Local glosses include behaviours, deontics, equations      | Violates **Strict Distinction** (C‑6); blocks reuse | **P‑L**: SenseCell is **lexical only**; behaviour/deontic math belongs to architheories   |
| **A4**  | **Edition blur**                 | Citing “BPMN” or “ITIL” without edition                    | Underspecified Context; un‑auditable sense shift       | **Context Card** carries `edition/year`; treat materially changed editions as distinct Contexts |
| **A5**  | **Context as type**              | Declaring “PROV‑O is‑a BPMN”                               | Implies inherited meanings between Contexts            | Contexts aren’t types; **no is‑a on Contexts** (E.10.D1). Use Bridges only                       |
| **A6**  | **Bridge without loss/fit**      | Bridge declared as “equivalent” with no assumptions        | Users infer total identity; trust calculus blind    | **P‑B**: Bridge must state `relation` and `CL`, plus a brief **loss/fit** note            |
| **A7**  | **Row from strings**             | Concept‑Set rows built from surface forms                  | Homonyms/synonyms contaminate rows                  | Build rows from **SenseCells**; add only cells connected by acceptable Bridges (F.7)      |
| **A8**  | **Transitivity overreach**       | Chaining weak near‑equivalences as if exact                | Inflates sameness; hides mismatch                   | **Bridge composition** (Sec. 10): compose with **min‑CL** and keep relation weakening     |
| **A9**  | **Domain ≡ Context**                | “Domain” name used as if it were a `U.BoundedContext`      | Domain families are informal; Contexts are formal      | Keep **Domain family** informative on Context Cards; meanings bind to **Contexts** only         |
| **A10** | **Time‑stance confusion**        | Treating `design` and `run` senses as identical            | Crosses senseFamilies; erases execution/spec split         | Carry **time stance** on Context Cards; prefer `design‑spec‑of` / `run‑trace‑of` Bridges     |

## 9 · Compact worked examples (multi‑architheory)

> *Each vignette shows (1) two Context Cards (abridged), (2) SenseCells inside Contexts, (3) the Bridge with relation & CL, and (4) a Concept‑Set hint (if any).*

### 9.1 Enactment × Provenance — *process* vs *activity*

* **Context A**: `BPMN_2_0` · *Business Process Model and Notation v2.0 (2011)* · *design*
  **SenseCell⟨process\@BPMN⟩**: Tech “process”; Plain “workflow process”; Gloss “graph of flow nodes/events executed by participants.”

* **Context B**: `PROV_O_2013` · *W3C PROV‑O (2013)* · *run*
  **SenseCell⟨activity\@PROV⟩**: Tech “activity”; Plain “provenance activity”; Gloss “time‑bounded occurrence using/generating entities.”

* **Bridge**: ⟨process\@BPMN⟩ ↔⟨`design‑spec‑of`, **CL=2**, loss: “no concurrency semantics in trace”; fit: “maps to execution plan”⟩ ⟨activity\@PROV⟩

* **Concept‑Set hint**: *No* same‑row nomination (relation ≠ near‑equiv); instead, record a **design↔run** linkage.

---

### 9.2 Control × PLC runtime — *actuation* vs *control output*

* **Context A**: `CTRL_Text_Classic` · *control theory primers* · *design*
  **SenseCell⟨actuation\@CTRL⟩**: Tech “actuation”; Plain “control output”; Gloss “signal applied to plant actuators.”

* **Context B**: `IEC_61131_3` · *PLC languages* · *run*
  **SenseCell⟨q‑output\@IEC⟩**: Tech “control‑output”; Plain “PLC output”; Gloss “program‑produced output variable to field I/O.”

* **Bridge**: ⟨actuation\@CTRL⟩ ↔⟨`near‑equivalent`, **CL=2**, loss: “hardware/scan‑cycle specifics absent in CTRL”; fit: “semantics align under linear regime”⟩ ⟨q‑output\@IEC⟩

* **Concept‑Set hint**: *Candidate same‑row* (F.7) with note: “merge permitted at **CL≥2** threshold.”

---

### 9.3 Measurement × Service — *observation* vs *service metric*

* **Context A**: `SOSA_SSN_2017` · *sensing/observations* · *run*
  **SenseCell⟨observation\@SOSA⟩**: Tech “observation”; Plain “measurement act”.

* **Context B**: `ITIL4_2020` · *services* · *(mixed)*
  **SenseCell⟨slo‑metric\@ITIL⟩**: Tech “service‑level metric”; Plain “service measure”; Gloss “quantity used to evaluate SLOs.”

* **Bridge**: ⟨observation\@SOSA⟩ ↔⟨`provides‑value‑for`, **CL=2**, loss: “organizational context not in SOSA”; fit: “metric results are measurement results.”⟩ ⟨slo‑metric\@ITIL⟩

* **Concept‑Set hint**: Not a same‑row case; this is a **role‑in‑use** relation (measurement feeds status evaluation).

---

### 9.4 Type reasoning — *subclass‑of* (OWL) vs *is‑a (plain)*

* **Context A**: `OWL2_Profiles` · *description logics*
  **SenseCell⟨subclass\@OWL⟩**: Tech “subclass‑of”; Plain “is‑a”.

* **Context B**: `ENG_Glossary` · *engineering plain usage compendium*
  **SenseCell⟨is‑a\@ENG⟩**: Tech “is‑a (engineering)”; Plain “kind‑of”; Gloss “informal subsumption in specs.”

* **Bridge**: ⟨subclass\@OWL⟩ ↔⟨`near‑equivalent`, **CL=1**, loss: “OWL formal constraints absent in ENG”; fit: “intended subsumption semantics.”⟩ ⟨is‑a\@ENG⟩

* **Concept‑Set hint**: Keep separate rows unless the consuming artefact demands **formal** semantics.

---

### 9.5 Deontics × Access — *permission* vs *role (RBAC)*

* **Context A**: `ODRL_2_2` · *policy/deontics*
  **SenseCell⟨permission\@ODRL⟩**: Tech “permission”; Plain “allowed action”.

* **Context B**: `NIST_RBAC_2004` · *access control*
  **SenseCell⟨role\@RBAC⟩**: Tech “access‑role”; Plain “permission set”.

* **Bridge**: ⟨permission\@ODRL⟩ ↔⟨`member‑of‑set‑in`, **CL=2**, loss: “contextual obligations not preserved”; fit: “RBAC roles aggregate permissions.”⟩ ⟨role\@RBAC⟩

* **Concept‑Set hint**: Not same row (different **kinds**); useful linkage for Enactment when binding duties to sessions.

---

## 10 · Extended reasoning moves (pure judgement schemata)

> *Judgements are conceptual entailments over Contexts, SenseCells, and Bridges. They carry no storage, workflow, or governance semantics.*

### 10.1 Context‑qualified use

`Context(C) ∧ mentions(C, s) ⊢ uses(s@C)`
*If s is used under Context C, we treat it as the local term s\@C.*

### 10.2 Sense formation (local)

`uses(t@C) ∧ gloss_C(t) ⊢ SenseCell⟨t@C⟩`
*A Context‑true gloss yields a SenseCell inside C.*

### 10.3 Admissible Bridge (creation predicate)

`SenseCell⟨x@A⟩ ∧ SenseCell⟨y@B⟩ ∧ A≠B ∧ rel∈R ∧ cl∈{0,1,2} ⊢ Bridge(x@A,y@B,rel,cl)`
*Only explicit relation `rel` with Congruence Level `cl` constitutes a Bridge.*

**Canonical relation set `R` (didactic catalogue):**
`equivalent‑under‑assumptions` · `near‑equivalent` · `overlaps` · `broader‑than` · `narrower‑than` · `design‑spec‑of` · `run‑trace‑of` · `representation‑of` · `member‑of‑set‑in` · `provides‑value‑for`.

### 10.4 Bridge composition (attenuating)

`Bridge(a,b,rel₁,cl₁) ∧ Bridge(b,c,rel₂,cl₂) ⊢ Bridge*(a,c,rel*,cl*)`

* `cl* := min(cl₁, cl₂)` (do **not** inflate confidence)
* `rel* := weaken(rel₁, rel₂)` (e.g., near‑equiv ∘ overlaps → overlaps)

*Reading:* Chained passages degrade to the weakest link.

### 10.5 Non‑identity by stance

`SenseCell⟨x@A(design)⟩ ∧ SenseCell⟨y@B(run)⟩ ∧ ¬declared(Bridge(x,y,near‑equiv,_)) ⊢ ¬same‑row(x,y)`
*Different time stances forbid same‑row unless an explicit near‑equiv Bridge exists.*

### 10.6 Row viability (Concept‑Set candidacy)

`Cells = {c₁…cₙ} ⊢ row‑viable(Cells) ⇔ connected(Cells, Bridges_{rel∈{equiv,near‑equiv}, cl≥k}) ∧ ¬contradiction(Cells)`

*Reading:* A row is viable if its cells form a connected subgraph via sufficiently strong Bridges and contain no mutually exclusive links.

### 10.7 Contradiction sieve

`Bridge(a,b,broader) ∧ Bridge(a,b,narrower) ⊢ contradiction(a,b)`
*Incompatible relations across the same pair flag a contradiction for review (conceptually).*

### 10.8 Non‑bridge implication ban

`name(x) = name(y) ∧ A≠B ⊢ ¬Bridge(x@A, y@B, _, _)`
*String equality across Contexts never implies a Bridge.*

---

## 11 · SCR/RSCR acceptance checks (conceptual)

> *These checks are **content‑oriented**; they validate that a manuscript/model respects Part F principles. No process/tool assumptions are implied.*

### 11.1 SCR — Static conformance

* **SCR‑F01 (Context‑qualified).** Every normative term is Context‑qualified (directly, or via a scoped header that unambiguously fixes the Context).
* **SCR‑F02 (Local cells).** Each SenseCell belongs to **exactly one** Context; no cell aggregates Cross‑context **senses**.
* **SCR‑F03 (senseFamily hygiene).** SenseCell glosses contain no behaviours/deontics/equations; those appear only in their architheories.
* **SCR‑F04 (Bridges explicit).** Every Cross‑context relation appears as a Bridge with `relation` and `CL` and a short **loss/fit** note.
* **SCR‑F05 (No string identity).** There is no use of string equality to stand in for Cross‑context identity.
* **SCR‑F06 (Time stance fidelity).** Where a Context fixes `design/run`, the SenseCells and any Bridges reflect that stance explicitly.
* **SCR‑F07 (Row viability).** Any Concept‑Set row shown is supported by a connected subgraph of Bridges with **CL ≥ threshold** and no contradictions.

### 11.2 RSCR — Regression & evolution

* **RSCR‑F01 (Edition split).** When a source edition changes materially, SenseCells tied to the old edition remain; new cells bind to the new Context; Bridges are re‑assessed.
* **RSCR‑F02 (Bridge stability).** If any Bridge endpoint changes gloss/stance, downgrade or retire the Bridge, documenting the **loss/fit** change.
* **RSCR‑F03 (Composition guard).** When composing Bridges in a chain, the resulting `CL` never exceeds the minimal link; relation weakens monotonically.
* **RSCR‑F04 (Heterogeneity guard).** The Context Map used by the manuscript remains finite and heterogeneous (≥ 3 families along each unification line).

### 11.3 Publish‑ready summary

An artefact is **ready** with respect to F.0.1 when:

1. **SCR‑F01…F07** hold for all terms, cells, rows, and bridges it presents;
2. **RSCR‑F01…F04** hold under simulated edition/stance changes;
3. Every Cross‑context statement can be read as a **Bridge** or as a composition of Bridges with stated attenuation.

---

## 12 · Quick reference (didactic)

* **Context** = a `U.BoundedContext` with edition, scope, and (if inherent) time stance.
* **SenseCell** = the minimal, lexical unit of meaning inside a Context (Tech/Plain labels + gloss).
* **Bridge** = the only Cross‑context relation, labelled with `relation` and **CL**, plus a short loss/fit note.
* **Concept‑Set row** = a didactic table row collecting **SenseCells** that are sufficiently the‑same‑thing under declared Bridges.

> **Mental checklist:** *Name the Context → speak in the Context → connect Contexts only by labelled bridges → build rows from bridged cells.*


# F.1 — Domain‑Family Landscape Survey \[A]

**“Fix the context of meaning before you name anything.”**
**Status.** Architectural pattern \[A], architheory‑agnostic.
**Depends on.** E.10.D1 **Lexical Discipline for “Context” (D.CTX)**; **F.0.1 Contextual Lexicon Principles**; A.7 **Strict Distinction (Clarity Lattice)**; A.11 **Ontological Parsimony**.
**Coordinates with.** F.2 **Term Harvesting & Normalisation**; F.3 **Intra‑Context Sense Clustering**; F.4 **Role Description**; F.9 **Alignment & Bridge Across Contexts**; **G.0–G.1** *(Scope/Aboutness handoff)*.  *(Bridges live only in F.9.)*

**Aliases (informative).** *Contexts‑first survey*; *Context cut*.

## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Establish a **finite set of U.BoundedContext** (“**context of meaning**”), each tied to an authoritative source or canon within a **domain family**, so that all later moves (term harvesting, clustering, role naming, cross‑context bridges) operate on **local meanings** rather than on drifting, globalised words.

**Applicability.** Use **at the start** of any unification effort for **any architheory** (Enactment (`U.RoleAssignment` + `U.RoleEnactment`), Sys-CAL, KD-CAL, Kind-CAL, LCA-CAL…) and **whenever** a discipline canon materially changes (new edition, re-framing, seminal result).

**Non‑goals.** No tooling, workflow, or editorial roles. No global ontology. No cross‑context equations. This pattern describes **how to think**, not how to store.

## 2 · Problem frame

Without explicit context of meaning:

1. **Word‑drift.** Common words (*process*, *role*, *service*, *model*) silently change sense across disciplines.
2. **Scope mirages.** One influential standard is mistaken for *the* domain.
3. **Retro‑lock.** Old editions become the implicit truth simply because they were “there first”.
4. **Category bleed.** Behavioural roles, epistemic statuses, deontic permissions mix because their contexts were never fixed.
5. **Name inflation.** New U.Types appear just to “stabilise” unstable words.

---

## 3 · Forces

| Force                        | Tension to resolve                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs locality** | We want cross‑domain unification, but **meaning is local** to a U.BoundedContext. |
| **Breadth vs parsimony**     | Wide coverage prevents bias; too many Contexts defeats understanding.                |
| **Recency vs continuity**    | New editions matter; but working knowledge often trails by years.                 |
| **Didactics vs fidelity**    | Pedagogically simple summaries must remain faithful to the source.                |

---

## 4 · Core idea (didactic)

**Think in Contexts, not in words.**
A *Context of meaning* is a **U.BoundedContext** (per D.CTX) that encloses a coherent vocabulary and its rules from a **specific, citable canon** (standard, BoK, seminal paper, textbook tradition). You **name and reason** *inside the Context*. When you must step between Contexts, you will **declare a bridge later** (F.9) with explicit losses or mismatches.

---

## 5 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **U.BoundedContext** (short: **Context** in Tech register). The formal *Context of meaning*.
* **Context** (Tech register alias for **U.BoundedContext**). Use **Context** for pedagogy, **U.BoundedContext** for formal references.
* **Domain family.** An **informative** shelf‑label grouping related Contexts (e.g., *workflow & provenance*; *services & deontics*; *sensing & measurement*; *types & taxonomies*; *control & actuation*). **No semantics** attach; Domain ≠ Context.
* **Context Card.** A **one‑screen** conceptual sketch of a Context (see §7.2).
* **SenseCell** *(appears downstream)*. A **(Context × Local‑Sense)** address; F.3 will mint these after clustering. Mentioned here only to keep the destination in view.

---

## 6 · Solution — the Contexts‑first survey (conceptual, notation‑free)

**Step 1 — Declare your unification line(s).**
State which architheory threads are in play (e.g., *Enactment + KD‑CAL sensing + Sys‑CAL execution*). This keeps the cut purposeful.

**Step 2 — Cut the landscape by domain families.**
For each line, **select at least three distinct domain families** (heterogeneity guard). Examples:

* *Workflow & provenance* (BPMN 2.0; W3C PROV‑O)
* *Services & deontics* (ITIL 4; ODRL 2.2)
* *Sensing & measurement* (SOSA/SSN; ISO 80000‑1)
* *Types & taxonomies* (OWL 2; FCA corpus)
* *Control & actuation* (state‑space control texts; IEC 61131‑3)

**Step 3 — For each family, sketch 1–3 Context Cards.**
Prefer canonical, widely cited canons. If a field is fragmented, choose one **exemplar** and one **counter‑voice** to surface heterogeneity.

**Step 4 — Make **locality** explicit.**
Treat words as **context‑local**. *Process (BPMN)* ≠ *process (thermodynamics)* ≠ *process (PROV)*. Do not reconcile. Do not average. **Just fix the Contexts.**

**Step 5 — Bound the set.**
Small enough to hold in working memory. As a rule of thumb:

* per unification line: **≥ 3 families**;
* per family: **1–3 Contexts**.
  More only if a missing Context hides a known sense‑split you will certainly need.

**Step 6 — Postpone bridges.**
If two Contexts seem “close”, **resist** collapsing. Note the tension and defer to **F.9 Alignment & Bridge**.

---

## 7 · What to record (conceptual, not clerical)

**7.1 The two‑minute memory.**
Everything you need to *think correctly later* fits on an eight‑line card. No registries, no workflows, no storage choices.

**7.2 The Context Card (one‑screen sketch).**
*(Each bullet is a thought, not a field.)*

* **Name & edition.** *“BPMN 2.0 (2011)”* • *“W3C PROV‑O (2013)”* • *“ITIL 4 (2020)”*.
* **Domain family.** *workflow* / *provenance* / *services* / *deontics* / *sensing* / *types* / *control* … *(informative only; never used to infer meaning).*
* **Scope gist** *(didactic; ≠ `USM.ScopeSlice(G)`)*. One line that marks the **inside/outside** (“workflow **graphs & participants**”, “provenance **entities/activities/agents**”).
* **Time stance** *(if inherent)*. Does the canon speak **design** (specifications, models) or **run** (occurrences, acts)?
* **Lexical trip‑wires.** Known homonyms or false friends in this Context (*“process ≠ thermodynamic process”*, *“role (RBAC) ≠ behavioural role”*).
* **Neighbour Contexts** *(informative)*. Close cousins that people often conflate (*BPMN ↔ PROV‑O*, *ITIL ↔ ODRL*).
* **Recency note.** *Current* / *superseded* / *candidate* (only as a reminder to yourself which text you mean).
* **Why this Context matters here.** One sentence linking to your unification line (“we will name Executions later; PROV‑O keeps them run‑time”).

> *If your Card spills beyond a screen, you are collecting facts, not fixing meaning.*

---

## 8 · Invariants (normative, lightweight)

1. **Context ≡ U.BoundedContext.** In this pattern, *Context* always means **U.BoundedContext** (per E.10.D1).
2. **Locality.** Words are **local to their Context**; no global meaning is implied or imported.
3. **Heterogeneity.** Each unification line considers **≥ 3 distinct Domain families** (labels are informative only).
4. **Parsimony.** Prefer few, canonical Contexts per family (1–3) that jointly expose the key sense splits.
5. **No bridging here.** No equivalence or mapping is asserted between Contexts in F.1. (Bridges live in **F.9**.)
6. **Design/run honesty.** If a canon fixes a temporal stance, note it. Do not reinterpret.
7. **Didactic primacy.** Each Context Card must be readable by a thoughtful engineer in **under two minutes**.
8. **Domain‑family neutrality.** Domain families **carry no semantics**; they SHALL NOT be used for inheritance, inference, or bridge implication.
9. **Scope naming separation.** `Scope gist` on Cards is **didactic only**; formal *Scope/Aboutness* (=`USM.ScopeSlice(G)` ⊕ `Aboutness(TopicHolon, ReferencePlane)`) is declared **in G.0–G.1**, not in F.1.

## 9 · Self‑checks (mental, not procedural)

* **The mirror test.** Can you explain *why each Context is inside* your cut **in one breath**? If not, you are surveying for comfort, not for meaning.
* **The homonym ping.** For each frequent word (*process*, *role*, *service*, *model*, *execution*), can you immediately list **the Contexts where it differs**? If not, add the missing Context.
* **The bridge itch.** Feel a strong urge to say “these are the same”? Good. **Write the itch down** and refuse to scratch it here. That’s F.9’s job.
* **The memory rule.** If your entire survey cannot be recalled **without opening a document**, it is too large.

---

## 10 · Micro‑examples (illustrative only)

*One unification line: Enactment (`U.RoleAssignment` + `U.RoleEnactment`) with sensing and execution.*

* **BPMN 2.0 (2011)** — *workflow family*.
  *Scope gist:* flow nodes, sequence flows, participants (design‑time).
  *Trip‑wires:* “process” here is a **graph**; not a run.
* **W3C PROV‑O (2013)** — *provenance family*.
  *Scope gist:* **Activity** that uses/generates entities (run‑time).
  *Trip‑wires:* “activity/process” here is a **temporal occurrence**.
* **ITIL 4 (2020)** — *services family*.
  *Scope gist:* service as value co‑creation; SLO/SLA (deontic talk nearby).
  *Trip‑wires:* “incident/problem/practice” don’t equal workflow tasks.
* **ODRL 2.2** — *deontics family*.
  *Scope gist:* permissions, prohibitions, duties (design).
  *Trip‑wires:* “duty/obligation” ≠ service guarantee mechanics.
* **SOSA/SSN (2017)** — *sensing family*.
  *Scope gist:* Observation as an act yielding a Result for a property.
  *Trip‑wires:* “observation” ≠ “state”; it’s an **act** with a **procedure**.
* **IEC 61131‑3** — *control languages family*.
  *Scope gist:* tasks that **execute** programs (run‑time).
  *Trip‑wires:* “task/execution” ≠ “workflow process”.

> With only these Contexts fixed, later steps become almost mechanical: F.2 harvests terms **inside** each Context; F.3 clusters **within** each Context; F.4 names roles/statuses pointing to **SenseCells**; F.9 draws the bridges you refused to draw here.

## 11 · Anti‑patterns & remedies

| #       | Anti‑pattern               | Symptom in practice                                                                  | Why it harms thinking                                          | Remedy (conceptual move)                                                                                                |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A1**  | **“One‑Book Domain”**      | Everything is justified from a single canon (“X is the domain”).                     | Projectionism; blinds heterogeneity; brittle to new editions.  | Enforce **heterogeneity**: pick **≥ 3 distinct domain families** per unification line (§6 Step 2, §8‑3).                |
| **A2**  | **Context‑less talking**   | Words like *process*, *role*, *service* used without naming a Context.                  | Global words drift; later steps must guess meaning.            | Always **prefix with the Context** in thought and prose: *process (BPMN)*, *activity (PROV)*, *service (ITIL)* (§4, §7.2). |
| **A3**  | **Edition blur**           | “BPMN” or “ITIL” cited with no year or profile.                                      | Inadvertent sense shifts; debates about “what the book says.”  | Cards keep **name + edition** on the first line; think with the exact edition (§7.2).                                   |
| **A4**  | **Phonebook survey**       | Dozens of Contexts; no one can recall the cut.                                          | Violates didactic primacy; people default to global talk.      | **Parsimony rule**: 1–3 Contexts per family, just enough to reveal key sense‑splits (§6 Step 5, §8‑4, §9 “memory rule”).   |
| **A5**  | **Bridge‑by‑stealth**      | Phrases like “these are basically the same” inside the survey.                       | Hides losses; imports meaning across Contexts without scrutiny.   | **No bridging here**; write the *itch to bridge* down and defer to **F.9** (§6 Step 6, §8‑5).                           |
| **A6**  | **Role/status conflation** | *Role (RBAC)* treated as behavioural mask; *duty (ODRL)* treated as service runtime. | Category bleed across families.                                | Cards carry **lexical trip‑wires** (“RBAC role ≠ behavioural role”; “duty ≠ runtime guarantee”) (§7.2).                 |
| **A7**  | **Temporal fudge**         | *Activity* or *execution* discussed without run/design stance.                       | Misplaced assertions; design artefacts treated as occurrences. | Cards note **time stance** when inherent (design vs run) (§7.2, §8‑6).                                                  |
| **A8**  | **Domain = Context**       | A “domain” label used as if it were a Context (e.g., “control” == one context).         | Shelf label mistaken for a canon; sense becomes fuzzy.         | **Domain family is informative only**; Contexts are **U.BoundedContext** tied to specific canons (§5, §7.2).               |
| **A9**  | **Context inheritance**    | Arranging Contexts in is‑a hierarchies (“PROV is‑a BPMN”).                              | Suggests meaning flows by inheritance; erases locality.        | **No is‑a among Contexts**; relations between Contexts live in **F.9 bridges** (§8‑5).                                        |
| **A10** | **Didactic bloat**         | Context Card spills into pages of notes.                                             | Teaching burden overwhelms the core idea.                      | **One‑screen Card**; everything else belongs to later patterns (§7.1–§7.2).                                             |
| **A11** | **Family‑based inference** | Treating Domain‑family membership as implying similarity/equivalence. | Smuggles semantics via shelf labels; breaks locality. | **Domain family is informative only**; locality and any Cross‑context relation must be explicit (F.9). |

## 12 · Worked examples (multi‑architheory cuts)

> Each example shows **the cut** (the Contexts you keep in view) and the **thinking pay‑off** you get *before* any harvesting, clustering, or bridging.

### 12.1 Enactment (`U.RoleAssignment` + `U.RoleEnactment`) with sensing & execution (service acceptance)

**Unification line.** Enactment + KD‑CAL (sensing) + Sys‑CAL (execution).

**Contexts (six Cards).**

1. **BPMN 2.0 (2011)** — workflow family; **design**; *graph of flow nodes, participants*.
2. **PROV‑O (2013)** — provenance family; **run**; *Activity uses/generates Entities; Agents*.
3. **ITIL 4 (2020)** — services family; **design**; *service, SLO/SLA vocabulary*.
4. **ODRL 2.2** — deontics family; **design**; *permission / prohibition / duty*.
5. **SOSA/SSN (2017)** — sensing family; **run**; *Observation as act with Result*.
6. **IEC 61131‑3** — control languages; **run**; *tasks execute control programs*.

**Thinking pay‑off (examples).**

* You stop saying “*process uptime*” and think **Execution (IEC)** measured by **Observation (SOSA)** compared against **SLO (ITIL)**—three Contexts, three senses.
* You mark a trip‑wire: **RBAC role** (not in this cut) is *not* a **behavioural role (BPMN participant)**.
* You resist equating **PROV Activity** with **BPMN workflow**; later **F.9** may relate them with explicit loss.

---

### 12.2 Method quartet with types & measurement (model state graph)

**Unification line.** Method‑CAL + Kind-CAL + KD‑CAL.

**Contexts (five Cards).**

1. **SPEM 2.0 / ISO 24744** — methods family; **design**; *Method / MethodDescription language*.
2. **OWL 2 (profiles)** — types family; **design**; *class, subclass, equivalent class*.
3. **FCA corpus** — types family; **design**; *concept lattices*.
4. **SOSA/SSN (2017)** — sensing family; **run**; *Observation / Procedure*.
5. **ISO 80000‑1 (2022)** — metrology family; **design**; *quantity kinds, units*.

**Thinking pay‑off.**

* You keep **Method** (abstract how‑to) separate from **MethodDescription** (epistemic recipe) and **Execution** (run) because the Contexts already split design vs run.
* You avoid treating **FCA “concept”** as a **U.Type**; later F.9 can bridge OWL classes to FCA concepts with cautions.

---

### 12.3 Control & actuation with services (operational SLOs in plants)

**Unification line.** Sys‑CAL + LCA‑CAL (planned) + services/deontics.

**Contexts (five Cards).**

1. **State‑space control texts** — control family; **design**; *controller/plant, feedback*.
2. **IEC 61131‑3** — control languages; **run**; *task, program execution*.
3. **ISA‑95** — integration family; **design**; *levelled layers, interfaces*.
4. **ITIL 4 (2020)** — services family; **design**; *SLO/SLA*.
5. **SOSA/SSN (2017)** — sensing family; **run**; *Observation*.

**Thinking pay‑off.**

* “**Actuation**” is recognised as **control output** (Sys‑CAL), not a *service promise*.
* “**Incident**” (ITIL) is not a plant *fault* (Sys‑CAL); Contexts deter category errors.

---

## 13 · Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas, notation‑free)

> These are **mental moves**, not queries. They read “given these thoughts, this conclusion is safe to hold (conceptually).”

1. **Context set for a line**
   `line L declared ⊢ Contexts(L) = {C₁,…,Cₙ}`
   *Reading:* For a unification line **L**, the Contexts you deliberately keep in view are `{C₁,…,Cₙ}` (from your Cards).

2. **Heterogeneity check**
   `families(L) = F ⊢ heterogeneous(L) ≡ (|distinct(F)| ≥ 3)`
   *Reading:* Your cut is heterogeneous if it spans at least three **domain families**.

3. **Parsimony check**
   `Contexts(L)=R, families(L)=F ⊢ parsimonious(L) ≡ (∀f∈F: 1≤|R∩f|≤3)`
   *Reading:* Each family contributes a few Contexts, not a phonebook.

4. **Locality assertion**
   `term w, C∈Contexts(L) ⊢ meaning(w)@C is local`
   *Reading:* A word’s sense is **context‑local**; no global meaning is implied.

5. **Time‑stance guard**
   `C has stance s∈{design,run} ⊢ claims@C must respect s`
   *Reading:* If a Context is design‑time, do not make run‑time claims in it (and vice versa).

6. **Trip‑wire recall**
   `C lists tripWires T ⊢ for any w∈T, require Context‑prefix when speaking`
   *Reading:* Words on the trip‑wire list must be spoken with the Context name.

7. **Bridge embargo**
   `C₁≠C₂ ⊢ no‑equivalence(C₁,C₂) within F.1`
   *Reading:* F.1 never asserts equivalence across Contexts; postponement is principled, not procrastination.

8. **Context sufficiency probe**
   `common‑word w used in L ∧ w not covered by any trip‑wire ⊢ consider adding a Context that makes w differ`
   *Reading:* If a frequent word has no deliberate sense‑split in your cut, you may be missing a Context.

9. **Memory rule**
   `|Contexts(L)| too large ⊢ reduce until a careful mind can recite them unaided`
   *Reading:* The survey should live in memory, not in a registry.

---

## 14 · Relations (with other patterns)

**Builds on:**
E.10.D1 **Lexical Discipline for “Context” (D.CTX)** — ensures *Context* ≡ *U.BoundedContext* and reserves “Problem Frame” for narrative use.
A.7 **Strict Distinction** — guards object/description/carrier and design/run splits while you cut Contexts.
A.11 **Ontological Parsimony** — motivates the small cut.

**Constrains:**
**F.2** (Term Harvesting): harvest **inside** Contexts named here; every occurrence carries a Context name.
**F.3** (Intra‑Context Sense Clustering): cluster **per Context**; no Cross‑context sense claims.
**F.4** (Role Descriptions): any role/status template must cite a **SenseCell** that lives in a Context from this cut.
**F.9** (Alignment & Bridge): only F.9 may relate Contexts; never F.1–F.4.

**Used by.**
Architheories in Part C (Sys‑CAL, KD‑CAL, Kind-CAL, Method‑CAL, LCA‑CAL) as the *lexical starting grid* for their examples and definitions.

---

## 15 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **New edition appears.** Keep the old Card; add a new Card with the new edition. If the sense shifts, treat it as a **new Context**; if it is strictly editorial, mark recency but keep one context.
2. **New family emerges.** If a missing family explains recurrent confusion in your line, admit it with **one exemplar** Context; remove a less informative Context to keep parsimony.
3. **Language variants.** Treat language editions as **separate Contexts** unless the canon itself declares a single normative bilingual mapping.
4. **Trip‑wire growth.** When you notice a recurring confusion, add a crisp trip‑wire to the relevant Card (one line; no essays).
5. **Bridges discovered later.** Do not back‑port bridges into F.1; leave the Cards untouched and record the mapping in **F.9**.
6. **Dormant Contexts.** If a Context no longer contributes to any active line, move it to a *parking shelf* (informative note on the Card) rather than deleting it.

---

## 16 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

### 16.1 Static conformance checks (SCR)

* **SCR‑F1‑S01 (Heterogeneity).** For each unification line, the set of Cards spans **≥ 3 distinct domain families**.
* **SCR‑F1‑S02 (One‑screen Cards).** Each Card fits on one screen: name+edition; family; scope gist; time stance (if inherent); 1–3 trip‑wires; neighbour Contexts (optional); recency note.
* **SCR‑F1‑S03 (Locality pledge).** Nowhere in F.1 are Cross‑context equivalences or merges asserted.
* **SCR‑F1‑S04 (Parsimony).** In every family, **1–3** Contexts are kept; if more, a clear sentence justifies each extra Context’s unique sense contribution.
* **SCR‑F1‑S05 (Context discipline).** “Context” is used only as a synonym of **U.BoundedContext**; “domain” appears only as an informative family label.
* **SCR‑F1‑S06 (Temporal honesty).** If a canon fixes design/run stance, the Card states it.
* **SCR‑F1‑S07 (Family neutrality).** No claim, classification, or relation in F.1 relies on Domain‑family membership; families appear only as shelf labels on cards.

### 16.2 Regression checks (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F1‑E01 (Edition churn).** When a new edition is added, prior Cards remain; no silent replacement.
* **RSCR‑F1‑E02 (Family balance).** Adding/removing Cards does not drop any line below **three families**.
* **RSCR‑F1‑E03 (Trip‑wire coverage).** After introducing a new Context, the trip‑wire lists of neighbouring Contexts are reconsidered and updated if needed.
* **RSCR‑F1‑E04 (No creep).** Periodically apply the **memory rule**: if the cut no longer fits in working memory, shrink it.

## 17 · Didactic distillation (90‑second teaching script)

> “Before you name anything, **fix the context of meaning**. A *Context* is a **U.BoundedContext** tied to a specific canon—*BPMN 2.0*, *PROV‑O*, *ITIL 4*, *SOSA/SSN*, *IEC 61131‑3*, *OWL 2*. Words are **local to Contexts**: *process (BPMN)* is a workflow graph, *activity (PROV)* is a run‑time occurrence, *service (ITIL)* is a promise vocabulary. Cut the landscape so each unification line sees **at least three domain families**, with **one‑screen Cards** per Context (scope gist, time stance, trip‑wires). **Do not bridge** Contexts here—just write down the itch to bridge and defer it. Keep the cut **small enough to remember**. With Contexts fixed, harvesting (F.2), local clustering (F.3), role/status templates (F.4), and explicit Cross‑context bridges (F.9) become straightforward—and you avoid naming ghosts that come from words floating without walls.”

# F.2 — Term Harvesting & Normalisation \[A] 

**“Harvest words *inside Contexts*, name them in the Context’s own idiom, and stop there.”**
**Status.** Architectural pattern \[A], architheory‑agnostic.
**Depends on.** E.10.D1 **Lexical Discipline for “Context” (D.CTX)**; **F.0.1 Contextual Lexicon Principles** (Source · Local Meaning · Bridge‑Only Crossing); A.7 **Strict Distinction**; A.11 **Ontological Parsimony**.
**Coordinates with.** F.1 **Context Map via Context Cards**; F.3 **Intra‑Context Sense Clustering**; F.4 **Role Description**; F.9 **Alignment & Bridge Across Contexts**.
**Aliases (informative).** *context‑local harvesting*; *Local normalisation*.

---

## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **conceptual** (notation‑free) discipline for turning *Context‑internal usage* into **context‑local lexical units** ready for later reasoning—without Cross‑context merging and without slipping into governance or tooling. The result is a **small, auditable set of context‑local names and glosses** that faithfully reflect how the canon speaks.

**Applicability.** Use whenever a unification line (from F.1) needs **actual words** to be referenced by patterns in Part C (architheories) or by Role Descriptions (F.4). Re‑enter F.2 when a canon/edition changes or when a new Context is admitted in F.1.

**Non‑goals.** No global labels; no Cross‑context equivalence; no workflow or role descriptions; no storage/API talk. F.2 specifies **how to think**, not how to “run a pipeline”.

---

## 2 · Problem Frame

Even with Contexts fixed (F.1), three mistakes recur:

1. **Word‑centrism.** Treating a string as if it carried its meaning across Contexts (*process*, *role*, *service*).
2. **Over‑normalisation.** Forcing one spelling/morphology across different canons, erasing Context‑specific cues.
3. **Premature structure.** Smuggling behaviour, deontics, or type structures into what should remain **lexical**.

F.2 prevents these by **localising** meaning and **naming** strictly **inside** each Context.

---

## 3 · Forces

| Force                      | Tension to resolve                                                               |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Uniformity vs locality** | Desire for consistent names vs Context‑specific idioms that must be preserved.      |
| **Parsimony vs recall**    | Keep the harvested set small vs keep rare but pivotal terms that unlock bridges. |
| **Didactics vs fidelity**  | Two‑register labels (tech/plain) vs fidelity to the canon’s own phraseology.     |
| **Speed vs safety**        | Move fast to enable F.3/F.4 vs avoid any Cross‑context conclusion in F.2.           |

---

## 4 · Core idea (didactic)

**Harvest *inside* each Context; name *in that Context’s idiom*; do not cross Contexts.**
For every Context (a **U.BoundedContext** from F.1), you gather **attested phrases** as *thought‑cues*, choose a **Local Normal Form (LNF)** that matches the Context’s idiom, attach a **two‑register label** (Tech/Plain), and write a **one‑sentence gloss**. That’s all. You do **not** claim sameness with any other Context; you do **not** embed behaviour or deontics; you do **not** mint U.Types here. These *local lexical units* will become **Local‑Senses** in F.3 and later addressable **SenseCells** (Context × Local‑Sense).

---

## 5 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Context** — Tech‑register alias for **U.BoundedContext** (per E.10.D1).
* **Attested phrase** — A short, verbatim cue from the canon that shows how a word is used **in this Context** (citation idea, not a record format).
* **Local Normal Form (LNF)** — The Context‑specific canonical surface you will use when referring to the term in this Context (minimal editing: spelling/hyphenation/casing per the canon).
* **Two‑register label** — **Tech** (engineer‑facing) and **Plain** (pedagogic) forms for the same Context‑local meaning.
* **Gloss (one‑sentence)** — A **Context‑faithful** description of how the canon uses the term, at **minimal generality**.
* **Local lexical unit** — The quintet *(Context, LNF, Tech, Plain, Gloss)*. This is F.2’s only outcome.
* **Homonymy (signal)** — Awareness that the **same string** has **different local lexical units** across Contexts (no relation asserted).
* **SenseCell** *(appears downstream)* — Address **(Context × Local‑Sense)** minted in F.3; mentioned here so you know what you’re preparing.

> *Everything above is a way of thinking. None of it implies a database, statuses, or roles.*

---

## 6 · Solution — three mental moves (notation‑free)

### Move A — **Localise the word**

**Question to ask.** *“In which Context am I hearing this word?”*
**Action (mental).** Point to a specific **Context** (from F.1). Grab 1–2 **attested phrases** that are representative **in this Context**.
**Outcome.** You stop thinking “global word” and start thinking “context‑local usage”.

*Micro‑cue.* If you cannot name the Context, do not harvest the word.

---

### Move B — **Name it in the Context’s idiom**

**Question to ask.** *“How would this Context itself write it?”*
**Action (mental).** Choose the **LNF** (Context‑conformant spelling/hyphenation). Then write the **two‑register label** and a **one‑sentence gloss** that says **what the canon means here**—nothing more.
**Outcome.** You have a **local lexical unit** *(Context, LNF, Tech, Plain, Gloss)*.

*Micro‑cues.*
• Prefer the canon’s head noun; keep canonical hyphens; avoid invented compounds.
• The **Plain** label should help a non‑specialist; the **Tech** label should match engineers’ eyes.
• The **Gloss** must fit on a single line; defer details to F.3.

---

### Move C — **Fence it off**

**Question to ask.** *“What must I refuse to conclude here?”*
**Action (mental).** Explicitly **refuse** to: (1) compare across Contexts, (2) fold morphology that the canon treats as meaningful, (3) embed behaviour, deontics, or type structure.
**Outcome.** A clean, **context‑local** lexical unit that will be safe to cluster in F.3 and safe to bridge (or not) in F.9.

---

## 7 · Guard‑rails (normative, lightweight)

1. **context‑locality.** Every local lexical unit **MUST** cite a Context (U.BoundedContext from F.1).
2. **Context‑idiom normalisation.** LNF **MUST** respect the Context’s idiom (spelling/hyphenation/casing) and use **minimal edits**.
3. **Two registers.** Each unit **SHOULD** carry both **Tech** and **Plain** labels for didactics; if one is missing, justify.
4. **Minimal generality (G‑1).** The gloss **MUST** be as specific as the Context’s canon requires—no broader.
5. **I/D/S layer hygiene (A.7).** **MUST NOT** include behaviour equations, deontic rules, measurement math, or type axioms; those belong to architheories.
6. **No Cross‑context claims.** **MUST NOT** assert equivalence, subsumption, or similarity with terms in other Contexts (F.9 only).
7. **Edition honesty.** If the Context’s canon has multiple editions with shifting usage, treat them as distinct Contexts in F.1 before harvesting.
8. **Parsimony.** Prefer **few, telling** lexical units over long tails; keep head terms that will power F.3/F.4/F.9.

---

## 8 · Micro‑examples (illustrative, context‑local)

> Each line is *one* local lexical unit. No relations are implied across lines.

* **Context:** *BPMN 2.0 (2011)* — **LNF:** `process`
  **Tech:** `process` · **Plain:** `workflow process`
  **Gloss:** “Directed graph of flow nodes and sequence flows enacted by participants.”

* **Context:** *PROV‑O (2013)* — **LNF:** `activity`
  **Tech:** `activity` · **Plain:** `temporal occurrence`
  **Gloss:** “Time‑bounded occurrence that uses and generates entities and is linked to agents.”

* **Context:** *ITIL 4 (2020)* — **LNF:** `service‑level‑objective`
  **Tech:** `service‑level‑objective` · **Plain:** `service target`
  **Gloss:** “Target value for a service characteristic within a service promise vocabulary.”

* **Context:** *NIST RBAC (2004)* — **LNF:** `role`
  **Tech:** `access‑role` · **Plain:** `permission role`
  **Gloss:** “Named grouping of permissions assignable via sessions.”

* **Context:** *SOSA/SSN (2017)* — **LNF:** `observation`
  **Tech:** `observation` · **Plain:** `measurement act`
  **Gloss:** “Act applying a procedure to a feature of interest to produce a result.”

* **Context:** *IEC 61131‑3* — **LNF:** `task`
  **Tech:** `task` · **Plain:** `runtime program execution`
  **Gloss:** “Cyclic or event‑driven execution unit for control programs.”

---

## 9 · Didactic heuristics (informative)

* **Keep the Context prefix in your inner speech.** Say “*process (BPMN)*”, “*activity (PROV)*”.
* **Prefer head nouns.** If the canon says “service‑level objective”, do not shorten it to “objective”.
* **Resist elegance that erases signal.** Hyphens and case often carry the Context’s culture; keep them.
* **Gloss from use, not from opinion.** Quote in your mind, then compress; avoid importing definitions from neighbouring Contexts.

## 10 · Anti‑patterns & remedies

| #       | Anti‑pattern                 | Symptom (in thought or prose)                                        | Why harmful                                                  | Remedy (conceptual move)                                                                                |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A1**  | **Global normal form**       | One “canonical” label reused across Contexts.                           | Erases local meaning; invites stealth bridges.               | Keep **LNF per Context**; any Cross‑context relation belongs to **F.9** only.                                 |
| **A2**  | **String = meaning**         | Assuming identical strings denote one concept across Contexts.          | Homonym collision (*process*, *role*, *service*).            | Always prefix mentally with the **Context**; treat same string in different Contexts as **different units**.  |
| **A3**  | **Over‑normalisation**       | Folding hyphens/case/morphology “for consistency”.                   | Loses the canon’s idiom; breaks citations.                   | **Minimal edits** toward the Context’s idiom; never toward a global house‑style.                           |

## 11 · Worked examples (multi‑architheory, context‑local only)

> Each line is a **local lexical unit** *(Context, LNF, Tech, Plain, Gloss)*.
> No Cross‑context relation is implied. Later clustering (F.3) and bridges (F.9) may connect them.

### 11.1 Enactment + sensing

* **Context:** *BPMN 2.0 (2011)* — **LNF:** `process`
  **Tech:** `process` · **Plain:** `workflow process`
  **Gloss:** “Directed graph of flow nodes and sequence flows enacted by participants.”

* **Context:** *PROV‑O (2013)* — **LNF:** `activity`

  **Tech:** `service‑level‑objective` · **Plain:** `service target`
  **Gloss:** “Target value for a service characteristic within a service promise vocabulary.”

*Thinking pay‑off:* you can phrase “compare **observation** to **service‑level‑objective**” without importing workflow or provenance semantics.

## 12 · Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas, notation‑free)

> Read each as a **permitted mental move** over the outcomes of F.2.
> Symbols: `R` = Context (U.BoundedContext), `u` = local lexical unit, `s` = surface string.

1. **Localisation**
   `heard(s) ∧ R chosen ⊢ localize(s,R)`
   *You decide to hear `s` only **in** Context `R`.*

2. **Context‑idiom normalisation**
   `localize(s,R) ⊢ LNF_R(s) = ℓ`
   *Within `R`, the **Local Normal Form** for `s` is `ℓ`.*

3. **Unit formation**
   `LNF_R(s)=ℓ ∧ labelTech=t ∧ labelPlain=p ∧ gloss=g ⊢ unit(u) = ⟨R,ℓ,t,p,g⟩`
   *A **local lexical unit** is formed (quintet).*

4. **Lexical‑only guard**
   `unit(u) ⊢ lexicalOnly(u)`
   *No behavioural/deontic/type math is attached to the gloss.*

5. **Homonymy signal (Cross‑context)**
   `LNF_Ra(s)=ℓa ∧ LNF_Rb(s)=ℓb ∧ Ra≠Rb ⊢ homonymy(s) ⊇ {Ra,Rb}`
   *Same string across Contexts is flagged as **different** by default.*

6. **Minimal generality check**
   `unit(u) ⊢ minimal(u) ⇔ gloss(u) says no more than the Context’s usage requires`
   *The gloss fits the Context; broader claims are withheld.*

7. **Two‑register adequacy**
   `unit(u) ⊢ didactic(u) ⇔ (tech(u) faithful) ∧ (plain(u) explanatory)`
   *Tech stays canonical; Plain helps non‑specialists.*

8. **No Cross‑context conclusion**
   `unit(u@Ra), unit(v@Rb), Ra≠Rb ⊢ ¬(u ≡ v) (within F.2)`
   *F.2 never asserts Cross‑context equivalence.*

9. **Ready‑for‑F.3 signal**
   `lexicalOnly(u) ∧ minimal(u) ∧ didactic(u) ⊢ readyF3(u)`
   *A unit is suitable input for **intra‑Context clustering** in F.3.*

---

## 13 · Relations

**Builds on:**
**F.1** (Contexts fixed; heterogeneity/parsimony in place).
**E.10.D1 D.CTX** (Context ≡ U.BoundedContext; “Problem Frame” reserved for narrative).
**F.0.1** (Source · Local Meaning · Bridge‑Only Crossing).

**Constrains:**
**F.3** (Intra‑Context Sense Clustering): operates **only** on units **from one Context**; produces Local‑Senses and addressable **SenseCells**.
**F.4** (Role Description Definition): may **cite SenseCells**, not raw strings.
**F.9** (Alignment & Bridge): consumes **homonymy signals**; declares explicit Cross‑context mappings with loss policies.

**Used by.**
Architheories in Part C when referencing domain idioms (labels stay **context‑local**).

---

## 14 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **New edition appears.** Add a Context in F.1; harvest afresh in F.2 using that Context; do not overwrite earlier units.
2. **Idiomatic update discovered.** If your LNF fought the canon’s idiom, **re‑LNF** within the same context; keep labels/glosses steady unless the canon itself differs.
3. **Ambiguity inside a Context.** If use splits, **mint two units** with distinct glosses; F.3 will sort their relation (same/different Local‑Sense).
4. **Language split.** Treat each language canon as its **own Context**; resist cross‑language merges in F.2.
5. **Tail pruning.** If units accumulate without feeding F.3/F.4/F.9, drop them from the working set; keep head terms that carry bridges.
6. **DSL quarantine.** If a tool dialect is unavoidable, keep it as one context among others; never let it define the idiom for other Contexts.

---

## 15 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

### 15.1 Static conformance (SCR)

* **SCR‑F2‑S01 (context‑locality).** Every unit cites a Context from F.1.
* **SCR‑F2‑S02 (Idiomatic LNF).** Each LNF reflects the Context’s spelling/hyphenation/casing with **minimal edits**.
* **SCR‑F2‑S03 (Two registers).** Each unit carries both **Tech** and **Plain** labels; if not, a reason exists tied to didactics.
* **SCR‑F2‑S04 (Lexical‑only).** No gloss contains behaviour, deontics, measurement math, or type axioms.
* **SCR‑F2‑S05 (No Cross‑context claims).** Nowhere does F.2 assert equivalence/similarity/subsumption across Contexts.
* **SCR‑F2‑S06 (Minimal generality).** Glosses match the Context’s use; no globalisation.
* **SCR‑F2‑S07 (Temporal honesty).** For Contexts with fixed design/run stance, units and glosses respect it.

### 15.2 Regression (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F2‑E01 (Edition split).** Introducing a new edition yields new units under a new Context; earlier units persist unchanged.
* **RSCR‑F2‑E02 (Normaliser stability).** Adjusting an LNF does not silently widen/narrow the gloss.
* **RSCR‑F2‑E03 (Language split).** Adding a second language yields a second Context; no bilingual collapse in F.2.
* **RSCR‑F2‑E04 (No stealth bridges).** After updates, F.2 still contains **zero** Cross‑context identity claims; any mapping appears only in F.9.
* **RSCR‑F2‑E05 (Head‑term focus).** Periodic check shows the unit set remains small and oriented to F.3/F.4/F.9 needs.

## 16 · Didactic distillation (60‑second script)

> “In F.2 you **harvest inside Contexts**. For each Context, pick the canon’s own phrasing, choose a **Local Normal Form** in that idiom, add **Tech** and **Plain** labels, and write a one‑sentence **Gloss** that matches how that Context talks. Stop there. No bridging, no behaviour, no equations. If the same string appears in another Context, treat it as a **different unit**. These units feed F.3, where you’ll sort senses **within** a Context, and F.9, where you’ll relate Contexts explicitly. This keeps meaning local, names faithful, and later reasoning clean.”

# F.3 — Intra‑Context Sense Clustering \[A] 

**“Within one context, decide what ‘the same sense’ really is—before you ever cross Contexts.”**
**Status.** Architectural pattern \[A], architheory‑agnostic.
**Depends on.** F.1 **Domain‑Family Landscape Survey**; F.2 **Term Harvesting & Normalisation**; E.10.D1 **Lexical Discipline for “Context” (D.CTX)**; A.7 **Strict Distinction**; A.11 **Ontological Parsimony**.
**Coordinates with.** F.4 **Role Description**; F.7 **Concept‑Set Table**; F.8 **Mint or Reuse Decision**; F.9 **Alignment & Bridge Across Contexts**.
**Aliases (informative).** *context‑local clustering*; *Sense consolidation*.

---

## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Consolidate the **context‑local lexical units** from F.2 into a **small set of Local‑Senses** that actually operate in that **one context (U.BoundedContext)**. Each Local‑Sense receives a crisp, didactic label pair (Tech/Plain) and a short sense statement. The result is an **addressable basis** for later uses (Role Assignment, tables, bridges) that is **still strictly context‑local**.

**Applicability.** Apply **after** F.2 for any Context that will feed naming (F.4/F.5), decision gates (F.8), Cross‑context bridges (F.9), or exemplars in Part C. Use again whenever the canon (edition) **shifts usage** enough to split or merge senses **within the same context**.

**Non‑goals.** No Cross‑context comparison or merging. No behaviour/deontics/type mathematics. No storage schemas or workflows. This is **pure sense‑making** inside one context.

---

## 2 · Problem Frame

context‑local units (LNF + labels + gloss) from F.2 often **over‑ or under‑differentiate** meaning:

1. **Over‑split:** superficial variants (*service‑level‑objective* vs *SLO*) treated as different “things”.
2. **Under‑split:** one gloss covering **two selectional frames** or incompatible use‑cases.
3. **Drift within a canon:** multi‑chapter texts use the same head differently unless the reader **consolidates** the intended sense.
4. **Didactic mismatch:** engineer‑friendly label and plain label drift apart when units remain too granular.

F.3 repairs this **inside the Context** by clustering “same sense” and distinguishing “different sense”, with **parsimony**.

---

## 3 · Forces

| Force                     | Tension to resolve                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parsimony vs fidelity** | Few Local‑Senses ease teaching; too few dilute real distinctions the canon relies on.                            |
| **Usage vs definition**   | Glosses should reflect **how the canon uses the word**, not an imported dictionary definition.                   |
| **Labels vs idiom**       | Tech label must stay in the canon’s idiom; Plain label must help newcomers—without inventing a new sense.        |
| **Stability vs openness** | Consolidated senses must be stable enough for Role Descriptions and tables, yet revisable when the canon’s use clearly splits. |

## 4 · Core idea (didactic)

**Cluster by usage, not by string.**
Inside one context:

* **Same sense** → **Local‑Sense**: a small, coherent usage‑region the canon treats as one idea (even if it has aliases or minor surface variation).
* **Different sense** → **two Local‑Senses**: incompatible selectional frames, entailments, or role in the canon’s own statements.

Each Local‑Sense becomes **addressable** when paired with its Context: **SenseCell = (Context × Local‑Sense)**. SenseCells are **context‑local coordinates**; they do not pre‑judge any Cross‑context mapping.

---

## 5 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Context** — short for `U.BoundedContext` (per D.CTX).
* **Unit** — a context‑local lexical unit from F.2 (LNF + Tech/Plain + gloss).
* **Local‑Sense** — the **conceptual cluster** of Units deemed “same sense” **within that Context**.
* **SenseCell** — the **address** for a Local‑Sense: *(Context, Local‑Sense)*. This is what later patterns will **cite**.
* **Counter‑example** — a short, canonical sentence or use that **must not** be covered by the Local‑Sense; it sharpens the boundary.
* **Usage cue** *(informative)* — a clue from usage (collocational patterns, paraphrases, entailments in the canon) that **suggests** merge or split. Cues **do not decide**; the canon’s intent does.

---

## 6 · Solution — how to think the clustering (notation‑free)

> What follows are **mental moves**, not steps for a team. Use them as probes until the Context’s usage partitions itself naturally.

**6.1 Consolidate aliases into one Local‑Sense.**
If Units differ only by **orthography, abbreviation, or canon‑blessed synonymy** and are **used interchangeably** in the Context’s own sentences, treat them as **one Local‑Sense**.
*Example (ITIL):* *service‑level‑objective* and *SLO* → one Local‑Sense.

**6.2 Split on incompatible selectional frames.**
If the same head pairs with **different kinds of arguments** or plays **different roles** in the canon’s statements (and those roles cannot both be true at once), split.
*Example (BPMN):* *event* as **node type** vs as **occurrence narrative** in a tutorial → two Local‑Senses; adopt the **node type** sense if that is the normative layer.

**6.3 Split on entailments that pull apart.**
If paraphrases lead to **different entailments** (e.g., one implies temporality, another structural position), you have two senses.
*Example (PROV):* *activity* implies **time‑bounded use/generate**; it cannot be the same sense as a **static capability**.

**6.4 Prefer sense minimality.**
If two candidate Local‑Senses never lead to **different conclusions** in the Context’s own use, merge them. If they sometimes do, split them—and record a **counter‑example** to keep the boundary crisp.

**6.5 Keep Tech label idiomatic; Plain label helpful.**
Tech label stays as the canon speaks; Plain label conveys the **function** of the sense to a careful newcomer. Neither label may **broaden** the sense beyond usage.

**6.6 Name only as much as you will use.**
If a fine-grained split has **no downstream consequence** (Role Descriptions, tables, bridges), prefer the coarser Local-Sense.

---

## 7 · Outputs (conceptual, not clerical)

F.3 yields, **per Context**:

1. A **small set of Local‑Senses**, each with:

   * **Label pair**: *Tech* (idiomatic) · *Plain* (didactic).
   * **Sense line**: one‑sentence usage statement, in the Context’s voice.
   * **Inside list** (informative): which Units from F.2 it consolidates.
   * **Counter‑example** (optional but powerful): a short use that must **not** be included.
1. A **SenseCell address** for each Local‑Sense: *(Context, Local‑Sense)*.

These are **thinking reference points** (cognitive only), not records or files. Later patterns **cite SenseCells by name**; nothing about storage is implied.

---

## 8 · Invariants (normative, lightweight)

1. **context‑locality.** Every Local‑Sense belongs to **exactly one context**. No Cross‑context clustering.
2. **Parsimony.** Local‑Senses are **few**; prefer the coarsest partition that preserves the canon’s distinctions.
3. **Idiomatic Tech.** The Tech label **must** stay in the Context’s idiom; no house‑style overrides.
4. **Didactic Plain.** The Plain label **must** aid comprehension **without adding scope**.
5. **Usage‑first.** Sense lines reflect the **canon’s usage**, not imported taxonomies or external theories.
6. **Counter‑examples rule.** If a counter‑example exists that the sense would wrongly include, **split**.
7. **No behaviour math.** Sense lines contain **no** behavioural, deontic, metrological, or type calculus; those live in Part C.
8. **Temporal honesty.** If the Context fixes **design/run stance**, the sense line respects it (e.g., PROV *activity* is **run‑time**).

---

## 9 · Self‑checks (mental probes)

* **Same‑conclusion test.** Do two candidate senses ever lead to **different conclusions** in the canon? If not, merge.
* **Argument‑slot probe.** Replace arguments in canonical sentences; do both candidates still read true? If one fails, split.
* **Label inversion.** Read the Plain label alone: does it tempt you to over‑generalise? If yes, tighten it.
* **Counter‑example ping.** Can you state a **ten‑word** use that the sense must exclude? If you can, write it; if you cannot, your sense may be too broad.
* **Memory rule.** Can you recall the Context’s Local‑Senses **without notes**? If not, you split too finely.

## 11 · Local‑Sense Cards (one‑glance form)

> A **Local‑Sense Card** is a **one‑glance** sketch per sense in a Context. It teaches faster than prose lists and keeps senses crisp.

**Fields (thought‑items, not fields to fill):**

## 12 · Worked examples (multi‑architheory, all **intra‑Context**)

### 12.1 BPMN 2.0 (workflow Context)

**Card A — “process (graph)”**

* **Label**: Tech **process** · Plain **workflow graph**
* **Sense line**: A BPMN **graph of flow nodes and sequence flows** **specifying orchestration among participants** *(design‑time)*.
* **Inside**: *process*, *process model*, *business process* (when used as diagram).
* **Counter‑example**: *“This process took 5 minutes”* ← **runtime** occurrence, **not** this sense.

**Card B — “event (node‑type)”**

* **Label**: Tech **event (node)** · Plain **event symbol**
* **Sense line**: A **node‑type** that marks starts, ends, and intermediates; typed by trigger/result.
* **Inside**: *start event*, *message event*, *end event*.
* **Counter‑example**: *“The outage event happened at 13:05”* ← narrative occurrence, **not** the node‑type.

> **Outcome:** “Process uptime” is rejected as a BPMN sense; Execution belongs to another Context.

---

### 12.2 PROV‑O (provenance Context)

**Card C — “activity (run)”**

* **Label**: Tech **activity** · Plain **time‑bounded execution**
* **Sense line**: An **occurrence** that **uses** and **generates** entities; linked to agents; has start/end.

**Card F — “incident”**

* **Label**: Tech **incident** · Plain **service disruption**
* **Sense line**: An **unplanned interruption** or reduction in quality of a service.

---

### 12.5 OWL 2 (types Context)

**Card H — “subclass‑of”**

---

## 13 · Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas, notation‑free)

> Each schema captures a **safe mental move**. It implies no storage, API, or workflow.

1. **Alias‑to‑sense consolidation**
   `Context C ⊢ interchangeable(U₁,…,Uₖ) ⇒ Local‑Sense σ`
   *Reading:* If Units are used interchangeably **by the canon** in **C**, consolidate them into one Local‑Sense **σ**.

2. **Selectional‑frame split**
   `C ⊢ frames(U) = F, frames(V) = G, F ∩ G = ∅ ⇒ split(U,V)`
   *Reading:* In **C**, if the argument/role patterns do not overlap, treat as **different senses**.

3. **Entailment divergence**
   `C ⊢ entail(U) ≠ entail(V) on canonical paraphrases ⇒ split(U,V)`
   *Reading:* If paraphrases lead to **different conclusions** in the canon, split.

4. **Parsimony merge**
   `C ⊢ no‑test distinguishes {U₁,…,Uₖ} ⇒ merge(U₁,…,Uₖ)`
   *Reading:* If no canonical test yields a difference, merge into one sense.

5. **Counter‑example trigger**
   `C ⊢ ∃e: e should not be covered by σ ⇒ refine(σ)`
   *Reading:* A crisp counter‑example forces a narrower sense (split or relabel).

6. **Idiomatic Tech, faithful Plain**
   `C ⊢ labelTech(σ) in idiom(C) ∧ labelPlain(σ) ⊆ usage(σ)`
   *Reading:* Tech label speaks the canon; Plain label does not widen the sense.

7. **SenseCell address**
   `C ⊢ σ ⇒ SenseCell ⟨C,σ⟩`
   *Reading:* Pair each Local‑Sense with its Context to form an address used downstream.

8. **Temporal guard**
   `stance(C)=design ⇒ forbid(run‑claims in σ)` (and symmetrically)
   *Reading:* Sense lines must not cross the Context’s design/run stance.

9. **Edition guard**
   `C≠C′ (different editions with usage shift) ⇒ no‑merge(σ@C, τ@C′)`
   *Reading:* Do not merge senses across Contexts when editions shift usage.

10. **Completeness ping (optional)**
    `frequent head w in C ∧ no Local‑Sense on w ⇒ consider(sense for w)`
    *Reading:* If a common head lacks a sense, you may be missing a useful consolidation (within C).

## 14 · Relations

**Builds on:**
F.1 **Domain‑Family Landscape Survey** (Contexts fixed); F.2 **Term Harvesting** (Units ready); E.10.D1 **D.CTX** (Context discipline); A.7 **Strict Distinction**.

**Constrains:**

* **F.4 Role Description.** Role Descriptions **cite SenseCells**; they do **not** invent senses.
* **F.7 Concept‑Set Table.** Rows are built from **SenseCells** (later Cross‑context assembly); intra‑Context clarity here prevents row bloat.
* **F.8 Mint or Reuse Decision.** Decisions compare proposed names to **existing SenseCells** to avoid type inflation.
* **F.9 Alignment & Bridge.** Bridges connect **SenseCell ↔ SenseCell** across Contexts; F.3 provides the stable endpoints.

**Is used by.**
Part C architheories to ground examples and invariants in **Context‑true** language.

---

## 15 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **Usage clarifies → merge.** If two Local‑Senses never lead to different conclusions in the Context’s canon, **merge** and keep the narrower sense line.
2. **Usage diverges → split.** If new reading reveals incompatible roles/entailments, **split** and attach a counter‑example to each side.
3. **Edition change → new Context.** When a new edition **reframes** usage, treat it as a **separate Context** (F.1) and re‑cluster there.
4. **Label upkeep.** If the Plain label tempts broadening, tighten it; if the Tech label drifts from idiom, restore the canon term.
5. **Dormant sense.** If a Local‑Sense ceases to matter for any active line, leave it listed but mark it **low‑use** in your own notes; do not fold it into another unless rule 1 holds.
6. **Bridge temptation.** Record tensions to bridge **elsewhere**; F.3 never resolves Cross‑context relations.

---

## 16 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

### 16.1 Static conformance (SCR)

* **SCR‑F3‑S01 (context‑locality).** Every Local‑Sense is paired with **exactly one context**; no Cross‑context clustering appears.
* **SCR‑F3‑S02 (Label pair).** Each Local‑Sense has **Tech** (idiomatic) and **Plain** (didactic) labels; neither widens usage beyond the sense line.
* **SCR‑F3‑S03 (Sense line fidelity).** Each sense line is **grounded in canonical statements** of the Context; no behaviour/deontic/math content.
* **SCR‑F3‑S04 (Parsimony).** The set of Local‑Senses per Context is small enough to **recall unaided** by a careful mind.
* **SCR‑F3‑S05 (Counter‑example presence).** For any ambiguous head, at least one **counter‑example** is recorded to guard the boundary.
* **SCR‑F3‑S06 (Temporal honesty).** Where the Context has a declared stance, sense lines **respect design/run**.

### 16.2 Regression (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F3‑E01 (Merge soundness).** Every merge is justified by a **failed distinction test** (no selectional or entailment difference).
* **RSCR‑F3‑E02 (Split necessity).** Every split cites a **role/entailment conflict** or a concrete **counter‑example**.
* **RSCR‑F3‑E03 (Edition guard).** No Local‑Sense spans Contexts that differ by edition **with usage shift**.
* **RSCR‑F3‑E04 (Label stability).** Changes to labels do **not** change sense; if they do, the change is treated as a split/merge per E01/E02.
* **RSCR‑F3‑E05 (Downstream continuity).** After splits/merges, **SenseCell** references in F.4/F.7/F.9 remain **referentially clear** (new addresses are explicit; no silent aliasing).

---

## 17 · Didactic close (60‑second recap)

> **Within one context,** collect how the canon actually **uses** a head, not how we wish it did. **Merge** aliases that never lead to different conclusions; **split** uses that do. Give each consolidated use a crisp **Tech** label in the Context’s idiom and a faithful **Plain** label. The pair *(Context, Local-Sense)* is your **SenseCell**—the address later cited by Role Descriptions, tables, and bridges. No Cross‑context mergers here; that job belongs to F.9. Keep senses few, boundaries sharp, and labels honest.

# F.4 — Role Description (RCS + RoleStateGraph + Checklists) \[A] 

**“Name the mask or the badge — and say what it commits to — but only inside a Context.”**
**Status.** Architectural pattern \[A], architheory‑agnostic.
**Depends on.** E.10.D1 **Lexical Discipline for “Context” (D.CTX)**; **E.10.D2 Intension–Description–Specification Discipline**; F.1 **Domain‑Family Landscape Survey**; F.2 **Term Harvesting**; F.3 **Intra‑Context Sense Clustering**; A.2.1 **`U.RoleAssignment`**; A.7 **Strict Distinction**; A.11 **Ontological Parsimony**.
**Coordinates with.** F.5 **Naming Discipline for U.Types & Roles**; F.7 **Concept‑Set Table**; F.9 **Alignment & Bridge Across Contexts**; B.3 **Trust & Assurance Calculus** (for later status evaluation).
**Aliases (informative).** *Mask/Badge card*; *role card* (plain only).

---

## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **conceptual template** for two kinds of assignables:

* **Role Template** — a **behavioural mask** that a holder can wear **in a specific Context** (U.BoundedContext), shaping how it **acts** (via Method/Execution relations).
* **Status Template** — an **epistemic or deontic badge** that a holder (or artefact, event, claim) can **bear** inside a Context, shaping how it is **treated** (evaluation, permission, standing).

Each template is **grounded in a SenseCell** `⟨Context, Local‑Sense⟩` from F.3 and declares **minimal invariants** that later **assignments** must satisfy. No Cross‑context meaning is imported here.

**Applicability.** Whenever you need to **speak precisely** about what it means to be *a Participant (BPMN)*, *hold an access‑role (RBAC)*, *be an Incident (ITIL)*, or *carry a Verified status (evidence line)*, before minting U.Types or drawing Cross‑context bridges.

**Non‑goals.** No workflows, no storage, no editors. No equations for assurance or control; those live in Part B/C. This pattern describes **how to think and speak** about assignables — not how to manage files.

---

## 2 · Problem frame

Without explicit Role Descriptions:

1. **Role/status conflation.** Access **role** (RBAC) treated as behavioural **mask** (BPMN participant); deontic **duty** treated as runtime **effect**.
2. **Context drift.** A “role” quietly starts meaning different things across canons; later assignments contradict each other.
3. **Hidden commitments.** We name a role/status but never state what **must hold** when it is assigned; downstream reasoning becomes arbitrary.
4. **Premature unification.** A single template tries to straddle several Contexts; losses remain implicit.

---

## 3 · Forces

| Force                         | Tension to resolve                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Behaviour vs knowledge**    | A role changes how the holder **acts**; a status changes how the holder is **treated/assessed**. Keep **I/D/S layers** separate (E.10.D2; A.7). |
| **Locality vs reuse**         | We want reusable templates, yet meanings are **context‑local** (E.10.D1, F.1).                                                   |
| **Minimality vs sufficiency** | Invariants must be **few** and **decisive**; too many become pseudo‑procedures.                                              |
| **Didactics vs fidelity**     | A one‑screen card must be **teachable** without betraying the canon.                                                         |

---

## 4 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Context** — **U.BoundedContext** (per E.10.D1).
* **Local‑Sense** — a consolidated sense in a Context (F.3).
* **SenseCell** — the address `⟨Context, Local‑Sense⟩`.
* **Role Template** — behavioural mask defined **in** a Context, later bound by **`U.RoleAssignment`**.
* **Status Template** — epistemic/deontic badge defined **in** a Context, later asserted as a **claim** about a holder/artefact.
* **Holder** — the thing that may wear a mask or carry a badge (e.g., a **U.System**, **U.MethodDescription**, **U.Work**, **U.Episteme**).

---

## 5 · Core idea (didactic)

**A Role Description is a small card that says:**
**(i)** *which Context’s sense it relies on* (**SenseCell**),
**(ii)** *what label we use to speak about it* (Tech & Plain), and
**(iii)** *what must hold* when someone **wears** the mask (Role) or **bears** the badge (Status).

It is **not** a definition by prose alone; it is a **pledge of invariants** — minimal, Context‑true, and later checkable.

---

## 6 · The Role Description Card (one‑screen sketch)

> Each bullet is a **thought‑item**, not a file field.

**Header**

* **Template kind:** **Role** | **Status**
* **Label pair:** **Tech** (idiomatic) · **Plain** (didactic)  *(naming discipline in F.5)*
* **SenseCell:** `⟨ContextId, Local‑Sense label⟩`

**Applicability**

* **Holder scope:** what can wear/bear it (e.g., *U.System*, *U.Work*, *U.MethodDescription*, *U.Episteme*).
* **Time stance:** **design** / **run** aligned to the Context (F.1).
* **Preconditions (Context‑true):** crisp conditions that must already be true in the Context’s idiom.

**Invariants (minimal)**

* **Behavioural invariants (Role)** *or* **Evaluation invariants (Status)** — 2–5 short lines stating what **must** hold after assignment/assertion, using the Context’s vocabulary and SenseCells where needed.
* **Separation guard:** a one‑line reminder of what this template **does not** imply (prevents senseFamily mixing).

**Consequences (informative)**

* **Typical interactions:** which **Method/Execution/Observation** constructs (by SenseCell) this template usually touches — *names only*.
* **Common misreads (trip‑wire):** 1–2 bullets to prevent known confusions.

> **Memory rule:** If your card can’t be read in **under two minutes**, you are writing a manual, not a template.

---

## 7 · Normative invariants (template discipline)

1. **context‑local grounding.** Every Role Description **MUST** cite exactly one **SenseCell** as its semantic locus.
2. **I/D/S layer separation.**
   * A **Role Template** **MUST NOT** encode deontic, access, or measurement rules.
   * A **Status Template** **MUST NOT** encode behaviour or control flow.
1. **Time honesty.** The card’s stance (**design/run**) **MUST** match the Context’s stance (F.1).
2. **Minimality.** Invariants **SHOULD** be the **fewest that decide** the assignment; avoid procedural sequences.
3. **No Cross‑context smuggling.** A single card **MUST NOT** import foreign semantics; if two Contexts are needed, the relation is handled later in **F.9**.
4. **Label fidelity.** **Tech** label **MUST** be idiomatic to the Context; **Plain** label **MUST** not widen the sense (F.3).
5. **Binding contract (roles).** A **Role Template** is the **design‑time mask**; at run‑time, a **`U.RoleAssignment`** creates **System‑in‑Role** instances that are subject to the card’s invariants.
6. **Assertion contract (statuses).** A **Status Template** is a **badge**; asserting it **commits** to the card’s evaluation invariants and to the Context’s way of checking them (later anchored via SenseCells, not formulas here).

---

## 8 · Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas, notation‑free)

> Conceptual moves only; no APIs, no data stores.

1. **Template grounding**
   `Template T cites SenseCell ⟨C,σ⟩ ⊢ meaning(T) is local to C`
   *Reading:* The template’s meaning is **context‑local**.

2. **Role assignability**
   `holder h, RoleTemplate T, preconds_T(h) ⊢ assignable(h,T)`
   *Reading:* If the **preconditions** hold for **h**, it is **eligible** to wear the mask **T**.

3. **Role assignment obligation**
   `assignable(h,T) ∧ bind(h,T: C) ⊢ invariants_T(h) must hold`
   *Reading:* Once bound (via **`U.RoleAssignment`**), **h** must satisfy **T**’s behavioural invariants.

4. **Status assertability**
   `StatusTemplate S, evidence_in_C supports S for x ⊢ assertable(x,S)`
   *Reading:* If evidence **in the Context C** supports **S** for **x**, the badge is **assertable** (details of evidence logic live in Part B).

5. **Status consequence**
   `assertable(x,S) ∧ assert(x,S) ⊢ evaluation_invariants_S(x)`
   *Reading:* Once asserted, **S**’s evaluation invariants constrain how **x** is treated.

6. **Separation guard**
   `RoleTemplate T ⊢ not(deontic_implied(T))` · `StatusTemplate S ⊢ not(behaviour_implied(S))`
   *Reading:* Wearing a mask doesn’t grant permissions; carrying a badge doesn’t define behaviour.

7. **Bridge embargo**
   `T cites ⟨C,σ⟩ ∧ C≠C′ ⊢ no‑equivalence(T@C, −) inside F.4`
   *Reading:* No Cross‑context equivalence is asserted here; use **F.9** later.

## 9 · Worked examples (multi‑architheory, Context‑true)

> Illustrative cards only; names are **tech/plain labels**, not final U.Type IDs (F.5 will govern naming).

### 9.1 **Role Template:** *participant (workflow actor)* — Context: **BPMN 2.0 (2011)**

* **Kind:** Role
* **Label:** Tech **participant** · Plain **workflow actor**
* **SenseCell:** `⟨BPMN_2_0, participant (actor in workflow)⟩`
* **Holder scope:** **U.System** (organisation, team, service)
* **Time stance:** **design**
* **Preconditions:** Holder is addressable as a **lane/pool** in the workflow model.
* **Behavioural invariants:**

  1. Activities **assigned to** the participant appear in its lane/pool.
  2. The participant **interacts** through message flows at its boundaries.
  3. The participant **does not** define run‑time occurrence; it **structures** the model.

* **Typical interactions (informative):** BPMN **process (graph)**; message **event (node)**.
* **Common misreads:** ≠ **RBAC role**; ≠ **PROV Activity**.

* **Preconditions:** A defined set of **permissions** exists for the role.
* **Evaluation invariants:**

  1. If **x** carries this badge, **x**’s session inherits exactly the role’s **permissions**.

* **Holder scope:** **U.Work** (recorded occurrence affecting a service)
* **Time stance:** **run**
* **Preconditions:** A **service** exists with declared **SLOs/quality metrics**.
* **Evaluation invariants:**

  1. The occurrence **reduces** service quality below acceptable levels.
  2. It triggers **restoration activities** per service practice (names only).
* **Separation guard:** Not a plant **fault**; not a BPMN **event node**.
* **Typical interactions:** **SLO** (ITIL), **Observation** (SOSA) — names only.
* **Common misreads:** ≠ **problem** (root cause category).

---

### 9.4 **Role Template:** *task runner (control runtime)* — Context: **IEC 61131‑3**

* **Behavioural invariants:**

  1. Invokes assigned program according to **cycle/trigger**.
  2. Provides **schedule constraints** (period/priority) to its program.
* **Separation guard:** No claim about **deontic** guarantees or **service** targets.
* **Typical interactions:** **Execution** (A.15 family), **Actuation** (Sys‑CAL).
* **Common misreads:** ≠ **workflow task**; ≠ **algorithm** (design).

## 10 · Anti‑patterns & remedies

| #       | Anti‑pattern            | Symptom (in a card)                                                       | Why it harms thinking                                    | Remedy (conceptual move)                                                                                        |
| ------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A1**  | **Role⇄Status blur**    | A Role card says “grants permission”; a Status card dictates behaviour.   | **senseFamily mixing (Role vs Status)**; incoherent assignments.              | Move permission talk to a **Status**; keep Role invariants purely behavioural. Add a **separation guard** line. |
| **A2**  | **Pan‑Context template**   | One card cites several canons implicitly (“BPMN/PROV process”).           | Imports meaning across Contexts; hides losses.              | Keep **one SenseCell per card**. If Cross‑context relation is needed, defer to **F.9 Bridge**.                     |
| **A3**  | **Silent time flip**    | Card defined in a **design** Context asserts run‑time facts (or vice versa). | Violates F.1 time stance; produces category errors.      | Align **Time stance** to the Context; relocate run‑facts to status/evidence lines or to another Context.              |
| **A4**  | **Procedural template** | Long “steps” instead of minimal invariants.                               | Becomes a method recipe, not an assignable mask/badge.   | Replace sequences with **decisive invariants** (2–5 lines) that must hold regardless of procedure.              |
| **A5**  | **Permission leakage**  | A BPMN Role claims access rights “by wearing the mask”.                   | Conflates access with behaviour; weakens RBAC semantics. | State explicitly: **no permissions implied**. Bind access via a **Status** in the RBAC Context.                    |
| **A6**  | **Evidence bake‑in**    | Status card encodes metrics/formulas.                                     | Smuggles Part B maths; reduces portability.              | Keep only **evaluation invariants** in Context language; actual checks live in Part B/C via SenseCells.            |
| **A7**  | **Global label**        | Tech label chosen for cross‑discipline appeal (“Actor”) not Context idiom.   | Loses local meaning; harms F.3 clustering.               | Use **Context‑idiomatic Tech label**; provide a Plain label for teaching (F.5 governs labels).                     |
| **A8**  | **Concept inflation**   | Multiple near‑duplicate cards for the same SenseCell.                     | Noise; brittle naming.                                   | Prefer **refinement** (see §11) or a single card with tighter invariants; avoid duplicates.                     |
| **A9**  | **Holder sprawl**       | Holder scope lists unrelated kinds (“U.System or U.Work or U.Episteme”).  | Ambiguity at binding time.                               | Shrink **Holder scope** to the real carriers; if truly different, split cards.                                  |
| **A10** | **Anchor relapse**      | Card talks about “anchors” or “global context.”                           | Re‑introduces banned jargon; confuses D.CTX.             | Replace with **Context** / **SenseCell**; never use “anchor”.                                                      |
| **A11** | **Tooling creep**       | Mentions manifests, pipelines, editors.                                   | Violates E.5 guard‑rails; notational dependency.         | Remove all process/tool talk; keep card **concept‑only**.                                                       |
| **A12** | **Bridge‑by‑label**     | Using identical labels to imply Cross‑context sameness.                      | Stealth equivalence; no loss policy.                     | Labels do not bridge. Any Cross‑context claim goes to **F.9** with a declared CL policy.                           |

## 11 · Concept‑level operators (refinement & compatibility)

> **Judgement schemas** — pure reasoning moves over cards. No APIs, no storage, no workflow.

Let **`sense(T)`** denote the **SenseCell** cited by template **T**.
Let **`inv(T)`** denote the set of **invariants** on T.
Let **`senseFamily(T)`** ∈ {**Role**, **Status**}.
Let **`stance(T)`** ∈ {**design**, **run**} (from the Context).

### 11.1 Same‑Context equivalence

**Form.**
`sense(T₁) = sense(T₂) ∧ inv(T₁) ⇔ inv(T₂) ⊢ T₁ ≡ T₂`

**Reading.** Two cards in the **same Context** with logically equivalent invariants **co‑designate** the same assignable.

*Tech cue.* Use this to **merge duplicates** conceptually without changing labels.

---

### 11.2 Refinement (strictness order)

**Form.**
`sense(T₁) = sense(T₂) ∧ inv(T₁) ⇒ inv(T₂) ⊢ T₁ ⪯ T₂`

**Reading.** **T₁** is a **refinement** of **T₂** if its invariants **imply** those of **T₂** (same Context).

*Effects.* Assigning **T₁** automatically satisfies **T₂**; the converse need not hold.

---

### 11.3 Incompatibility (mutual exclusion)

**Form.**
`sense(T₁) = sense(T₂) ∧ (inv(T₁) ∧ inv(T₂) ⇒ ⊥) ⊢ incompatible(T₁,T₂)`

**Reading.** Two cards in the same Context are **mutually exclusive** if their invariants cannot co‑hold.

*Use.* A conceptual **Separation‑of‑Duty** signal without governance.

---

### 11.4 Co‑wearability / co‑bearability

**Form.**
+`senseFamily(T₁)=senseFamily(T₂)=Role ∧ stance(T₁)=stance(T₂) ∧ ¬incompatible(T₁,T₂) ⊢ coWearable(T₁,T₂)`
+`senseFamily(T₁)=senseFamily(T₂)=Status ∧ ¬incompatible(T₁,T₂) ⊢ stackable(T₁,T₂)`

**Reading.** Within a Context, two Roles can be worn together (or two Statuses carried) when they **do not** conflict.

---

### 11.5 Time‑stance alignment

**Form.**
`stance(T)=design ⊢ inv(T) may not assert run‑facts`
`stance(T)=run ⊢ inv(T) may not assert design‑commitments`

**Reading.** Invariants must **respect** the Context’s temporal stance (F.1).

---

### 11.6 Binding/Assertion admissibility

**Form. (Roles)**
`holder h ∧ preconds_T(h) ⊢ assignable(h,T)`
`assignable(h,T) ∧ bind(h,T) ⊢ inv(T)(h)`

**Form. (Statuses)**
`evidence_in_Context(C) supports S for x ∧ sense(S)=⟨C,σ⟩ ⊢ assertable(x,S)`
`assertable(x,S) ∧ assert(x,S) ⊢ inv(S)(x)`

**Reading.** Preconditions and evidence **gate** the act of wearing a mask or bearing a badge; once done, **invariants apply**.

---

### 11.7 Cross‑context embargo (inside F.4)

**Form.**
`sense(T₁)=⟨C,−⟩, sense(T₂)=⟨C′,−⟩, C≠C′ ⊢ no‑relation(T₁,T₂) here`

**Reading.** **F.4** never asserts Cross‑context relations. If a relation is desired, it becomes a **Bridge** in **F.9**.

---

## 12 · Relations (where this card sits)

**Builds on:**
E.10.D1 **D.CTX** (Context ≡ U.BoundedContext); F.1 (Contexts cut); F.2 (harvested terms); F.3 (Local‑Sense → **SenseCell**); A.2.1 **`U.RoleAssignment`**; A.7 **Strict Distinction**.

**Constrains:**
**F.5** (Naming): pairs **Tech/Plain** must reflect the **Context idiom** and avoid Cross‑context overreach.
**F.7** (Concept-Set Table): rows reference **SenseCells**; Role Description cards **point to** those rows but never **create** cross-context identity.
**F.8** (Mint or Reuse?): prefer **refinement (⪯)** over new cards; split cards rather than mixing senseFamilies.
**F.9** (Alignment & Bridge): any relation across Contexts is **declared there**; Role Description cards remain context-local.

**Is used by.**
A.15 family (Role–Method–Work alignment) to interpret **System‑in‑Role** and **Work**; Part B evidence/status checks to interpret **evaluation invariants**.

---

## 13 · Migration notes (conceptual playbook)

1. **Context update (edition split).** If the Context’s Local‑Sense changes, **fork** the card per new SenseCell; keep the old card as historically valid.
2. **Family correction (Role/Status).** If a card mixes behaviour and deontics, **split** into one Role and one Status; move permission language to the Status.
3. **Tighten by refinement.** When practice reveals a stricter understanding, prefer **T′ ⪯ T** over replacing **T**; this preserves existing assignments conceptually.
4. **Rename safely (labels only).** If F.5 revises labels, change **Tech/Plain** wording; **SenseCell** and **invariants** remain untouched.
5. **Scope correction.** If Holder scope was too wide, split into **parallel cards** with disjoint Holder scopes; avoid complex conditional invariants.
6. **Bridge discovery.** Do **not** inject Cross‑context text into cards; record the relation as an **F.9 Bridge** (with CL policy), leaving the cards as they are.

---

## 14 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

### 14.1 Static conformance (SCR)

* **SCR‑F4‑S01 (Uni‑Context grounding).** Each card cites **exactly one SenseCell**.
* **SCR‑F4‑S02 (Family honesty).** `senseFamily(T)` is **either** Role **or** Status; invariants match the family; a **separation guard** line is present.
* **SCR‑F4‑S03 (Time honesty).** `stance(T)` matches the Context’s stance; no opposing‑stance claims appear.
* **SCR‑F4‑S04 (Minimality).** Card lists **2–5** invariants; none are procedural step lists.
* **SCR‑F4‑S05 (Label fidelity).** Tech label is **idiomatic to the Context**; Plain label does not widen meaning.
* **SCR‑F4‑S06 (No Cross‑context import).** Invariants reference only the Context’s idiom or other **SenseCells** by **name** (no identity claims).
* **SCR‑F4‑S07 (Holder clarity).** Holder scope is a **single coherent kind** (e.g., `U.System` or `U.Work`), not a grab‑bag.
* **SCR‑F4‑S08 (No tooling/governance).** Card contains **no** mentions of manifests, pipelines, editors, or workflows.

### 14.2 Regression (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F4‑E01 (Edition churn).** When a Context edition changes, existing cards are **not overwritten**; new cards are added per SenseCell.
* **RSCR‑F4‑E02 (Refinement safety).** If **T′ ⪯ T** is introduced, prior usages of **T** remain conceptually valid; no backward contradictions arise.
* **RSCR‑F4‑E03 (senseFamily integrity).** No card changes senseFamily across revisions (Role↔Status) without an explicit **split** noted.
* **RSCR-F4-E04 (Bridge discipline).** After adding an **F.9 Bridge**, Role Description cards remain **unchanged**; cross-context meanings do not seep back into cards.
* **RSCR‑F4‑E05 (Label updates).** Label changes per **F.5** preserve SenseCell and invariants; tests treat them as **renames**, not semantic edits.

## 15 · Didactic distillation (60‑second close)

> A Role Description card is a **Context-true** way to speak about an assignable: a **Role** (behavioural mask) or a **Status** (epistemic/deontic badge).
> Each card names **one SenseCell**, gives a **Tech/Plain** label, states **minimal invariants**, and declares what it **does not** imply.
> Cards never mix **Role/Status senseFamilies** and never cross **I/D/S layers**, never flip time stance, and never import other Contexts.
> Inside one context, you can compare cards by **equivalence** (≡), **refinement** (⪯), **incompatibility**, and **co‑wearability**.
> across Contexts, say nothing in the card; use a **Bridge** later.
> Keep cards **one‑screen simple**: enough to decide assignments; nothing procedural; no tools; just clear thought.


# F.5 — Naming Discipline for U.Types & Roles \[D] 

**Status.** Definitional pattern \[D], architheory‑agnostic.
**Depends on.** E.10.D1 **Lexical Discipline for “Context” (D.CTX)**; **E.10.D2 Intension–Description–Specification (I/D/S)**; F.1 **Domain‑Family Landscape Survey**; F.2 **Term Harvesting & Normalisation**; F.3 **Intra‑Context Sense Clustering**; F.4 **Role Description Definition**; A.7 **Strict Distinction**; A.11 **Ontological Parsimony**; F.0.1 **context‑local Lexicon Principle (RLP)**.
**Coordinates with.** F.7 **Concept‑Set Table**; F.8 **Mint or Reuse?**; F.9 **Alignment & Bridge**; F.13 **Term Registry & Deprecation**.
**Aliases (informative).** *Context‑true naming*; *Two‑register labels*.

---

## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **small, normative code of naming** so that **U.Types** (Cross‑context categories) and **Role Descriptions** (context‑local Roles/Statuses) are labelled **clearly, locally faithful, and globally stable**, without importing tooling, workflows, or editorial process. Names are **consequences of meaning** fixed earlier (F.1–F.4), not badges invented to “stabilise” drifting words.

**Applicability.** Use **whenever** you (a) mint or revise a **U.Type** name from a **Concept‑Set row** (F.7), or (b) assign labels to a **Role Description** (F.4). This pattern governs **what a good name must be**, not *how a team produces it*.

**Non‑goals.** No registries, reviews, or hand‑offs. No style‑police for punctuation beyond conceptual clarity. No bridging or synonym decisions across Contexts (F.9 does that).

---

## 2 · Problem frame

Naming errors cause structural errors:

1. **Context denial.** A label hides its Context, inviting Cross‑context misuse (*“process”* used for both BPMN and PROV senses).
2. **senseFamily blur.** Names conflate **Role** (behavioural mask) with **Status** (epistemic/deontic badge).
3. **Over‑reach.** U.Types inherit jargon from one canon and sound global while being parochial.
4. **Under-reach.** Role Description labels sound so generic that they pretend to be U.Types.
5. **Unstable synonyms.** Labels drift to placate readers rather than reflect meaning fixed in SenseCells.

This code resolves these by **Context fidelity**, **senseFamily‑aware morphology**, and **two‑register pedagogy**.

---

## 3 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Tech label** — the **Context‑idiomatic** name engineers expect *inside that Context*.
* **Plain label** — a **teaching gloss** in simple English that does **not broaden** the sense.
* **Symbolic alias** *(optional)* — conventional symbol if the canon uses one (e.g., “≤”).
* **SenseCell** — the **(Context × Local-Sense)** address cited by a Role Description card (F.3–F.4).
* **Concept‑Set row** — the Cross‑context table row that supports minting a **U.Type** name (F.7).

---

## 4 · Core idea (didactic)

> **Name what the invariants already make true.**
>
> For Role Descriptions, **speak like the Context** (Tech), then **teach it** (Plain).
> For U.Types, **speak like nobody’s Context**: pick the **neutral, minimal‑generality** label that best fits the **intersection** shown by your Concept‑Set row.

---

## 5 · Normative rules — Role Descriptions (context‑local labels)

Let **T** be a Role Description in Context **C** with SenseCell `sense(T)=⟨C,σ⟩`.

**R‑RD‑1 (Two registers).** Provide **both**:
`Tech(T)` = the **Context‑idiomatic** phrase (exact canon wording if possible).
`Plain(T)` = a brief, neutral explanation *that does not broaden meaning*.
*Symbolic alias* is optional and purely informative.

**R‑RD‑2 (No Context tags in labels).** Do **not** embed the Context name in the label (avoid “(BPMN)” in the label itself). Context is already carried by the **SenseCell**; keep labels clean.

**R‑RD‑3 (senseFamily‑aware morphology).**
— **Role** names are **countable nouns** for masks (e.g., *Participant*, *Operator*, *Reviewer*). Avoid verbs and gerunds. Add the suffix **“Role”** **only** if the Context idiom risks confusion with a substance or a status (e.g., *“Reviewer Role”* in a Context that also has a *“Reviewer Status”*).
— **Status** names are **state nouns** or **adjectival‑noun collocations** (e.g., *Approved*, *Compliant*, *In‑Service*, *Access Role* (RBAC)). If a family of levels exists, encode the **level** (`Assurance L1`, `Readiness L2`) rather than inventing decorative adjectives.

**R‑RD‑4 (Local idiom first).** Prefer the **canon’s term of art** even if it sounds narrower than a cross‑discipline cliché. The Plain label handles pedagogy; the Tech label honours the Context.

**R‑RD‑5 (Minimal generality).** Choose the **narrowest label** whose invariants you actually assert. Do **not** “upgrade” *Task* to *Activity* or *Process* just to sound universal.

**R‑RD‑6 (No permissions by stealth).** Role labels **must not** imply entitlement (*“Privileged Operator”* is a Status+Role mashup). Keep deontics in **Status** names in the **deontics Context**.

**R‑RD‑7 (Edition‑neutral labels).** Do **not** bake edition/profile into labels. Edition lives in the **Context**; the card binds to a SenseCell that already encodes edition where needed.

**R‑RD‑8 (Short and stable).** Favour **1–3 words**. Avoid rhetorical adjectives (*“robust, optimal, best‑practice”*).

---

## 6 · Normative rules — U.Types (Cross‑context labels)

Let **U** be a U.Type minted from a **Concept‑Set row** (F.7) satisfying A.8 (≥3 domain families).

+**R‑UT‑1 (Witnessed neutrality).** The Tech label **must not** be a term owned by one context when alternatives exist. Prefer **discipline‑neutral head nouns** (*Result, Reading, Execution, Evidence, Requirement, State, Type Node*). **Use** *Characteristic/Scale/Value/Level/Coordinate/Score/Gauge* **only** when the U.Type denotes a **measurement‑sense** kind anchored in a declared **CharacteristicSpace**; otherwise avoid these measurement‑canon terms to prevent semantics bleed.

**R‑UT‑2 (Minimal generality).** Name the **least upper sense** that all row witnesses share. If *Observation* and *Measurement* disagree, perhaps the U.Type is **Result** or **Reading**, not **Observation**.

**R‑UT‑3 (No senseFamily mixing in names).** Do **not** name a U.Type with deontic or behavioural language (*“PermittedService”*, *“ResponsibleAgent”*). **Role/Status/Method/Execution** belong to **Role Descriptions (F.4)** or local senses; U.Types are *what‑it‑is* kinds, not *what‑it‑does* or *what‑is‑allowed*.

**R‑UT‑4 (Head–modifier discipline).** Prefer **head nouns** with **light modifiers** over stacked compounds.
Good: *Evidence Status*, *Requirement Status*, *Type Node*.
Risky: *Multi‑stage‑workflow‑execution‑record* (compresses a scenario into a name).

**R‑UT‑5 (No Context tags in names).** U.Types are **Context‑agnostic**; never append “(BPMN)”/“(PROV)”. Provenance for the row lives in F.7, not in the name.

**R‑UT‑6 (Alias only for pedagogy).** Allow **Plain aliases** for teaching; **Tech label** is unique and stable. Synonym management belongs to **F.13**; do not invent alternates ad hoc.

**R‑UT‑7 (Family coherence).** When minting a **family**, use **parallel shapes** (*… Status*, *… Level*, *… Characteristic* **only for measurement families with a declared CharacteristicSpace**) so related U.Types signal relation by form.

**R‑UT‑8 (Symbolic names sparingly).** Symbols may be listed as *aliases* for readers of formal sections; they are **never** the U.Type’s Tech label.

**R‑UT‑9 (No edition/version in name).** Versions live in the Concept‑Set evidence; the name denotes a **time‑robust kind**.

---

## 7 · Invariants (normative, lightweight)

**INV-F5-1 (Pair).** Every Role Description card and every U.Type **MUST** carry **Tech** and **Plain** labels; symbol is optional and informative.

**INV-F5-2 (Context fidelity for Role Descriptions).** `Tech(T)` **MUST** be idiomatic for its Context; `Plain(T)` **MUST NOT** broaden `sense(T)`.

**INV‑F5‑3 (Neutrality for U.Types).** `Tech(U)` **MUST** be discipline‑neutral with respect to the witness Contexts in its Concept‑Set row.

**INV‑F5‑4 (senseFamily honesty).** Role Description **Role** labels are **behavioural masks**; Role Description **Status** labels are **states/badges**; neither sneaks in the other senseFamily.

**INV‑F5‑5 (Minimality).** Labels **MUST** reflect the **minimal generality** supported by invariants (F.4 for Role Description, F.7 for U.Types).

**INV-F5-6 (No Context tags).** Names **MUST NOT** embed Context/edition tags; that information resides in SenseCells (Role Description) and Concept-Set rows (U.Types).

---

## 8 · Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas, notation‑free)

> Pure mental checks; no tools implied.

1. **Context-idiom check (Role Description).**
   `T in Context C ⊢ idiomatic(Tech(T), C)`
   *Reading:* The Tech label reads like the Context’s own term of art.

2. **Plain‑safety check.**
   `sense(T)=⟨C,σ⟩ ⊢ ¬broadens(Plain(T), σ)`
   *Reading:* The Plain label explains without enlarging the sense.

3. **Neutral‑witness check (U.Type).**
   `witnessContexts(U)=R ⊢ neutral(Tech(U), R)`
   *Reading:* The Tech label doesn’t privilege one witness Context’s jargon.

4. **senseFamily form check (Role Description).**
  `senseFamily(T)=Role ⊢ nounMask(Tech(T))`
  `senseFamily(T)=Status ⊢ stateForm(Tech(T))`
   *Reading:* The morphology matches the senseFamily.

5. **Minimality proof.**
  `inv(T) ⇒ nameScope(Tech(T)) ⊆ senseScope(sense(T))` (Role Description)
   `rowWitnesses(U) ⇒ nameScope(Tech(U)) ⊆ intersectionScope(row)` (U.Type)
   *Reading:* The name’s scope is **no wider** than what the invariants/witnesses support.

6. **Collision ping.**
  `similar(Tech(X), Tech(Y)) ∧ senseFamily(X)≠senseFamily(Y) ⊢ requireDisambiguatorOrSplit`
  *Reading:* If two labels nearly coincide across senseFamilies, either add a **minimal** disambiguator (Role Description only, within Context idiom) or split concepts.

---

## 9 · Micro‑examples (illustrative)

**Role Description (BPMN Context).**
Tech: **Participant** · Plain: *actor in a workflow* · senseFamily: **Role**
(*No “BPMN” in label; behaviour mask, not entitlement.*)

**Role Description (RBAC Context).**
Tech: **Access Role** · Plain: *named permission set* · senseFamily: **Status**
(*Deontic badge; not a behavioural mask.*)

**Role Description (ITIL Context).**
Tech: **Service‑Level Objective** · Plain: *service target value* · senseFamily: **Status**
(*Levelable family: SLO \[target], SLI \[indicator] handled in F.10/F.12 semantics, not in the label.*)

**U.Type (from Concept‑Set row: SOSA Observation, PROV Activity (result‑bearing), ML Metric Reading).**
Tech: **Result** · Plain: *the produced value or record of a measurement/assessment*
(*Neutral head noun when “Observation” is too Context‑coloured.*)

**U.Type (from OWL class, FCA concept, taxonomy nodes).**
Tech: **Type Node** · Plain: *a node in a type hierarchy or lattice*
(*Neutral across DL and FCA.)*

## 11 · Worked examples (multi‑architheory)

> Each example shows the **reasoning move** that leads to the label; no procedures, no tooling.

### 11.1 Role Description labels (context-local)

**(a) BPMN Context — behavioural mask vs node word**

* **SenseCell.** ⟨*BPMN 2.0*, local‑sense: lane/pool actor that enacts tasks⟩
* **Decision.** Tech = **Participant** (Context idiom); Plain = *actor in a workflow*
* **Why.** `Participant` is the mask; it is **not** the node (*Task*, *Event*). (R-RD-3, R-RD-4)

**(b) RBAC Context — deontic badge**

* **SenseCell.** ⟨*NIST RBAC*, local‑sense: named permission set assigned to sessions⟩
* **Decision.** Tech = **Access Role**; Plain = *named permission set*
* **Why.** It’s a **Status**, not a behavioural mask; deontic plane kept explicit. (R-RD-3, R-RD-6)

**(c) ITIL Context — service target**

* **SenseCell.** ⟨*ITIL 4*, local‑sense: target value for a service characteristic⟩
* **Decision.** Tech = **Service‑Level Objective**; Plain = *service target value*
* **Why.** Family will carry `… Level`, `… Indicator` in adjacent cards; avoids jargon drift. (R-RD-3, R-UT-7)

**(d) IEC 61131-3 Context — run-time execution notion as Role Description?**

* **SenseCell.** ⟨*IEC 61131‑3*, local‑sense: cyclic/event‑driven task unit⟩
* **Decision.** For a Role Description **Status** of a run, label **Completed**, **Failed**, **Skipped** (Context idiom); avoid naming the **Work** itself here.
* **Why.** The *record of work* is a **U.Type** elsewhere (A.15.1); Role Description in this Context carries **badges** of runs. (A.7 stance split; R-RD-3)

---

### 11.2 U.Type labels (from Concept‑Set rows)

**Row R₁ (measurement‑sense):**
SOSA: *Observation* • ML practice: *metric reading* • Metrology: *measurement result*

* **Witness Contexts.** sensing; ML metrics; metrology
* **Decision.** U.Type Tech = **Result**; Plain = *the produced value or record of a measurement/assessment*
* **Why.** Neutral head noun covering all witnesses; avoids privileging SOSA’s *Observation*. (R‑UT‑1, R‑UT‑2)

**Row R₂ (type‑structure):**
OWL: *class* / *subclass* • FCA: *formal concept* (node in concept lattice)

* **Witness Contexts.** DL; FCA
* **Decision.** U.Type Tech = **Type Node**; Plain = *a node in a type hierarchy or lattice*
* **Why.** Neutral over DL vs FCA; head‑modifier shape is stable. (R‑UT‑1, R‑UT‑4, R‑UT‑7)

**Row R₃ (status family):**
ITIL: *incident status* • Safety cert.: *assurance level* • QA: *readiness level*

* **Witness Contexts.** services; assurance; QA
* **Decision.** Two U.Types: **Assurance Level**, **Readiness Level** (family‑coherent), plus **Requirement Status** (for normative clauses)
* **Why.** Separates families; preserves level vs status distinction. (R‑UT‑7, R‑UT‑3)

---

### 11.3 Mixed scenario (service acceptance over execution traces)

**Contexts in play.** IEC 61131‑3 (run), SOSA/SSN (sensing), ITIL 4 (services).

1. **Role Description (ITIL)** — Tech: **Service-Level Objective**; Plain: *service target value*.
2. **U.Type (from R₁)** — Tech: **Result** (to host measured values).
3. **Role Description (IEC)** — Tech: **Completed** / **Failed** (Status on a run).
4. **Name discipline payoff.** The sentence “*Compare IEC run **Results** against the ITIL **Service‑Level Objective***” is Context‑true without tags, because each label encodes its **senseFamily** and neutrality.

---

## 12 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **When a Context changes edition.** Names stay; the **SenseCell** shifts to the new edition. Only change a label if the **sense** has changed; then **split** the card rather than mutate the name. (INV‑F5‑2, R‑RD‑7)

2. **When a Concept‑Set row gains a new witness Context.** Re‑ask neutrality: if the Tech label now privileges a Context, **refactor to a more neutral head** (e.g., `Observation` → `Result`). (R‑UT‑1, R‑UT‑2)

3. **Collision emergence.** If a **Role card** and a **Status card** converge phonetically (`Approver` vs `Approved`), keep both but add the **minimal morphological disambiguator** only where the Context idiom demands it (`Reviewer Role`). (R-RD-3)

4. **Family hygiene.** As families grow, keep **parallel shapes** (`… Level`, `… Status`). If a legacy label breaks shape, add a **Plain alias** for teaching; don’t rename the Tech label without Concept‑Set pressure. (R‑UT‑7, R‑UT‑6)

5. **Language variants.** Non-English canons keep **their own Tech labels** (idiomatic in that Context); the **Plain** label remains English in FPF unless the Part mandates localisation. (R-RD-4, INV-F5-1)

6. **Symbol addition.** You may add a **symbolic alias** later for readers of formal sections; never promote a symbol to the Tech label. (R‑UT‑8)

7. **De‑jargonising the Plain label.** If readers stumble, adjust **Plain** wording only; do **not** widen the sense. (Plain‑safety check)

8. **Deprecation path.** If a label must change, publish the **new Tech + Plain**, keep the old as an **alias** in the registry (F.13), and leave the reasoning trail in the Concept‑Set row that forced the rename. (R‑UT‑6, F.13 linkage)

---

## 13 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

### 13.1 Static conformance (SCR)

* **SCR-F5-S01 (Two registers).** Every Role Description card and U.Type **has both** Tech and Plain labels; any symbol is marked **alias**.
* **SCR-F5-S02 (Context fidelity for Role Descriptions).** For any Role Description `T` in Context `C`, `Tech(T)` appears idiomatic **in C**; `Plain(T)` does **not** broaden `sense(T)`.
* **SCR‑F5‑S03 (Neutrality for U.Types).** For any U.Type `U`, its Tech label does **not** coincide with a witness Context’s proprietary term when alternatives exist.
* **SCR‑F5‑S04 (senseFamily morphology).** Role labels are **countable nouns**; Status labels are **state nouns** / adjectival‑noun forms.
* **SCR-F5-S05 (Minimal generality).** For each label, there exists a reading where the **name’s scope ⊆ invariant scope** (Role Description) or **⊆ row intersection** (U.Type).
* **SCR‑F5‑S06 (No Context tags).** No label embeds Context or edition strings.
* **SCR‑F5‑S07 (Family coherence).** Families that claim parity (e.g., Levels) show **parallel shapes** across members.

### 13.2 Regression checks (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F5‑E01 (Witness drift).** When a Concept‑Set row gains/removes a witness Context, re‑evaluate **neutrality**; if violated, refactor the Tech label to a more neutral head.
* **RSCR-F5-E02 (Edition churn).** When a Context updates, Role Description labels remain stable unless the **sense** changed; if sense changed, **split** the card and keep aliases in F.13.
* **RSCR‑F5‑E03 (Collision guard).** If two labels become confusable across **senseFamilies**, either add the **minimal** disambiguator (Role Description only, Context‑idiom) or separate the concepts.
* **RSCR‑F5‑E04 (Rhetoric creep).** Periodic skim for decorative adjectives; remove them unless they encode formal levels or families.

---

## 14 · Didactic distillation (60‑second recap)

> **Name what is already true.**
> Role Description labels **speak like the Context** (Tech) and **teach without widening** (Plain).
> U.Type labels **speak like nobody’s Context**: neutral head nouns at **minimal generality**, shaped in **parallel families**.
> **Never** glue Context tags or editions into names. **Never** mix senseFamilies in morphology.
> If witnesses change, reconsider neutrality; if senses split, **split names**, don’t stretch them.
> The label is the **last step of understanding**, not the first.


# F.6 — Role Assignment & Enactment Cycle (Six-Step) \[A] 

**“Assign only what you can later justify by local meaning and observable facts.”**
**Status.** Architectural pattern \[A], architheory‑agnostic.
**Depends on.** E.10.D1 **Lexical Discipline for “Context” (D.CTX)**; F.1 **Domain‑Family Landscape Survey**; F.2 **Term Harvesting & Normalisation**; F.3 **Intra‑Context Sense Clustering**; F.4 **Role Description**; F.5 **Naming Discipline**.
**Coordinates with.** F.7 **Concept‑Set Table**; F.8 **Mint or Reuse?**; F.9 **Alignment & Bridge**; F.10 **Epistemic Status Mapping**; A.2.1 **U.RoleAssignment**; A.15.\* **Role–Method–Work alignment**; KD‑CAL (observations, results).
**Aliases (informative).** *Assign-and-verify mental loop*; *six-step role cycle*.

---

## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **minimal set of reasoning moves** that turn a **Role Description** (F.4), anchored in a **SenseCell**, into a **sound claim** about a concrete **holder**—either a **Role assignment** or a **Status assertion**—with **local meaning** (within one context) and a **clear path to evidence** (KD‑CAL). These are **mental moves**, not workflows or tools.

**Applicability.** Any time you (a) bind a system to a **Role** mask, or (b) assert a **Status** about a system/artefact, **inside one U.BoundedContext**. Use when drafting models, reconciling vocabularies, or reading external canons.

**Non‑goals.** No process charts, no registries, no governance roles. No Cross‑context equivalences (that is F.9). No operational runbooks—only conceptual judgements.

---

## 2 · Problem frame

Without disciplined Role Assignment & Enactment reasoning:

1. **Sense‑family slippage.** Behavioural **Roles** and deontic/epistemic **Statuses** get mixed (keep them on distinct **senseFamilies**, per F.0.1).
2. **Context drift.** A label is lifted from one canon and used as if universal.
3. **Evidence vacuum.** Assignments are asserted with no thought to what could **show** they hold.
4. **Time blur.** Design‑time masks are judged by run‑time traces (or vice versa).
5. **Name inflation.** New labels are minted to patch noisy assignments.

---

## 3 · Forces

| Force                       | Tension to resolve                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Locality vs reuse**       | Keep meaning inside one context while still naming things once across examples.         |
| **Clarity vs completeness** | State enough to be checkable without burying the reader in conditions.               |
| **Design vs run**           | Keep **stance** coherent: design‑time bindings are judged by design artefacts; if you need run‑time verification, express it as a **run‑Status/Role** Template—without confusing **stances** (A.7). |
| **Fact vs promise**         | Evidence (KD‑CAL) vs deontic expectations (service, policy) must not collapse.       |

---

## 4 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Context** — shorthand for **U.BoundedContext** (per E.10.D1).
* **SenseCell σ** — **address** **⟨Context C × Local‑Sense ℓ⟩** per F.3. (Informative: we write simply **σ**; it already contains **C**.)
* **Role Description** — a **Role** or **Status** card anchored in a SenseCell (F.4).
* **Holder** — the concrete system/artefact considered for a **Role** binding.
* **Subject** — the referent of a **Status** assertion; determined by the Template (may or may not be the Holder).
* **subject_of(τ, H)** — function yielding the **Subject** for Status assertions given Template **τ** (and, if needed, candidate **H**).
* **Eligibility** — conditions on the Holder that *must* hold to apply the Template (F.4 invariants).
* **Window** — the temporal stance or interval relevant to the claim (design/run; instant/period).
* **Evidence shape** — the **Observation/Result/Procedure/Feature** pattern (KD‑CAL) that could confirm/refute the claim in its Context.

## 5 · Pre‑conditions (lightweight)

1. The **Context** is in your F.1 cut; **Context ≡ U.BoundedContext**.
2. The **Template** references a **SenseCell** in that Context (F.4).
3. The **Holder** is identified (by type or instance) without relying on Cross‑context mappings.

---

## 6 · The six moves (judgement schemas, notation‑free)

Each move is a **thought you can justify**, expressed as `premises ⊢ conclusion`.
All moves are **context‑local** and **side‑effect free** (they assert knowledge; they do not modify artefacts).

### M1 · Locate — *Fix the Context and the Template*

**Form.**
`Template τ anchored at SenseCell σ≡⟨C, ℓ⟩ ⊢ address(τ) = σ`

**Reading.** Name the Context and the exact SenseCell that gives **local meaning** to the Template.
**Note.** This forbids “floating” Roles/Statuses and prevents Context drift.

---

### M2 · Stance — *Respect design/run stance*

**Form.**
`stance(C)=s ∧ stance(τ)∈{s, both} ⊢ compatible_stance(τ,C)`

**Reading.** The Template’s temporal stance is **compatible** with its Context’s stance (design vs run).
**Note.** Guards against judging a design‑mask by run‑traces or judging a run‑status by design artefacts.

---

### M3 · Qualify — *Check Holder eligibility*

**Form.**
`Holder H ∧ eligibility(τ) holds in C ⊢ eligible(H, τ @ C)`

**Reading.** Given the Template’s eligibility predicates (F.4), the Holder qualifies to be bound/assessed **in this Context**.
**Note.** Typical predicates: **type membership**, **capability present**, **scope fit**; all context‑local.

---

### M4 · Bind/Assert — *Make the Role Assignment / Status claim*

**Role assignment (behavioural mask).**
`eligible(H, τ @ C) ∧ window W ⊢ plays_role(H, τ : C) @ W`

**Status assertion (epistemic/deontic state).**
`eligible(H, τ @ C) ∧ window W ∧ S = subject_of(τ, H) ⊢ has_status(S, τ : C) @ W`

**Reading.** Assert either a **Role** binding or a **Status** about the appropriate subject (system, artefact, service), within a **Window**.
**Note.** The **subject** of a Status may differ from the Role holder (e.g., a *service* has SLO status; a *team* plays a Role).

---

### M5 · Evidence — *Shape what would make it true/false*

**Form.**
`plays_role/has_status κ in C ⊢ evidence_shape(κ) = Σ(C)`

**Reading.** From the Context’s semantics, state the **Observation/Result** pattern (KD‑CAL) that would confirm or refute the claim (**what**, **where**, **when**).
**Note.** This is not an execution plan: it is a **conceptual test** tied to the Context’s vocabulary.

---

### M6 · Conclude — *Issue a defensible verdict with confidence*

**Form.**
`evidence E fits Σ(C) ∧ invariants(τ) hold ⊢ holds(κ) with confidence γ ∈ [0,1]`

**Reading.** If observed facts match the expected evidence shape and Template invariants stand, the assignment/status claim **holds** with some confidence (cf. B.3).
**Note.** Confidence combines measurement adequacy (KD‑CAL) with any Context‑specific uncertainty; no Cross‑context boost is implied.

---

## 7 · Core invariants (normative)

1. **Locality.** Every judgement is **about one context**. No Cross‑context equivalence is presumed or implied (that is F.9’s remit).
2. **Strict splits.** (**a**) **senseFamily split:** **Role** ≠ **Status** (per F.0.1); (**b**) **stance split:** **design** ≠ **run** (A.7). Each judgement names its **senseFamily** and **stance**.
3. **Eligibility before claim.** No binding or status without **eligible(H, τ @ C)**.
4. **Window honesty.** Every claim states or inherits a **Window** consistent with `stance(τ)` and `stance(C)`.
5. **Evidence‑ability.** Every claim must admit at least one **evidence shape** Σ in its Context (KD‑CAL compatible).
6. **Name discipline.** Labels used in judgements follow F.5 (Tech/Plain registers; no Context tags inside names).

---

## 8 · Reasoning aides (didactic)

* **Context‑prefix speech.** Think and speak with the **Context prefix** when ambiguity lurks: *participant (BPMN)*, *role (RBAC)*, *activity (PROV)*.
* **Window templates.** Prefer short phrases: *“during release‑R3 cutover”*, *“for the Q3 service period”*, *“at 2025‑08‑12T14:30Z”*.
* **Evidence as shape words.** *Result of Observation of ⟨Characteristic⟩ on ⟨Feature⟩ by ⟨Procedure⟩ within W*—not a measurement script.  

**“Assign only what you can later justify by local meaning and observable facts.”**

| **AP‑2**  | **Role/Status Conflation**     | “Operator” modeled as a deontic grant; “SLO met” modeled as a Role.                         | Collapses **behavioural mask** and **epistemic/deontic state** (A.7).      | Re‑type the Template: **Role** for “can/does”, **Status** for “is/has (as a claim)”. Use **M4** accordingly.                 |
| **AP‑3**  | **Window‑less Claims**         | Binding/assertion with no time stance or interval.                                          | Uncheckable; invites retrospective reinterpretation.                       | Make **Window** explicit (§6 M4).

| **AP‑4**  | **Eligibility‑after‑the‑fact** | Declaring the claim, then back‑fitting eligibility to observed traces.                      | Confuses **necessary conditions** with **diagnostics**; risks circularity. | Perform **M3 Qualify** *before* **M4 Bind/Assert**; treat evidence only in **M5**/**M6**.                                    |
| **AP‑5**  | **Global Label Illusion**      | Using bare labels (“process”, “agent”, “role”) as if universal.                             | Hides the Context; fuels homonym errors.                                      | Always recover **M1 Locate**: `address(τ)=⟨Context, SenseCell⟩`. Use F.5 naming discipline (Tech/Plain registers).              |
| **AP‑6**  | **Evidence by Prestige**       | “Industry practice says …” offered instead of KD‑CAL‑shaped facts.                          | Replaces observable Results with authority talk.                           | State an **evidence shape Σ(Context)** in **M5**; later fill it with **Observation/Result** facts (KD‑CAL).                     |
| **AP‑7**  | **Design/Run Inversion**       | Verifying a design‑time mask by design documents; verifying a run‑status with design specs. | Violates temporal stance; yields non‑falsifiable claims.                   | Apply **M2 Stance**: the Template’s stance must be compatible with the Context. Evidence follows the stance.                    |
| **AP-8**  | **Premature Bridge**           | ... | ... | Keep the assignment/status claim local; if needed, create an **F.9 Bridge** with loss notes and CL penalty.                  |
| **AP‑9**  | **Token Proofs**               | Single anecdotal event taken as universal confirmation.                                     | Over‑generalises; ignores evidence windows and procedures.                 | In **M5**, include **Procedure** and **Window**; in **M6**, roll confidence γ from adequacy of sampling (KD‑CAL).            |
| **AP‑10** | **Role Explosion as Patch**    | New Role minted for every exception.                                                        | Name bloat; brittle semantics.                                             | Re‑examine **eligibility** and **Window**; consider a **Status** to mark exceptions instead of new Roles.                    |

## 10 · Worked examples (multi‑architheory)

> Each example is a **context-local** assignment/status reasoning trace using **M1…M6**. cross-context relations, if any, are noted as *optional* bridges (F.9) but not relied upon.

### 10.1 Service availability status (ITIL + KD‑CAL)

**Context.** *ITIL 4 (services family; design)*
**Template (Status).* `SLO:availability≥99.9%` anchored at **SenseCell** ⟨ITIL4, “SLO (availability)”⟩.

**M1 Locate.** `address(τ)=⟨ITIL4, SLO(availability)⟩`
**M2 Stance.** `stance(ITIL4)=design`, `stance(τ)=design` ⇒ `compatible_stance(τ, ITIL4)`
**M3 Qualify.** `eligible(Service S, τ@ITIL4)` if S is a published service with declared availability target.
**M4 Assert.** `has_status(S, τ:ITIL4) @ W` where `W = Q1‑2025` (the evaluation period).
**M5 Evidence shape Σ(ITIL4).** *Observation* of **availability characteristic** (MM‑CHR) for S, produced by a **Procedure** that samples uptime and computes the **Result** as ratio over `W`. (KD‑CAL/MM‑CHR terms only; no tool implied.)
**M6 Conclude.** If Results across `W` give ≥ 99.9 % with adequate sampling and declared exclusions applied, `holds( has_status(S, τ:ITIL4) @ W ) with γ≈0.9`.
*Optional bridge.* If uptime sensing vocabulary is expressed in **SOSA/SSN**, an **F.9 Bridge** may map ITIL’s “availability metric” to **ObservableProperty(availability)** with a declared CL penalty; the assignment/status claim itself remains ITIL-local.

---

### 10.2 Behavioural operator role (IEC 61131‑3 + Enactment)

**Context.** *IEC 61131‑3 (control languages; run)*
\**Template (Role).* `Control‑Task‑Executor` anchored at **SenseCell** ⟨IEC61131‑3, “task executes program”⟩.

**M1 Locate.** `address(τ)=⟨IEC61131‑3, task‑execution⟩`
**M2 Stance.** `stance(IEC61131‑3)=run`, `stance(τ)=run` ⇒ compatible.
**M3 Qualify.** Holder `PLC_7` qualifies if it hosts program `P` and is scheduled by task `T`.
**M4 Bind.** `plays_role(PLC_7, τ:IEC) @ W` where `W = [08:00, 18:00] 2025‑06‑05`.
**M5 Evidence shape Σ(IEC).** **Observation** of task schedule and program invocation logs as **Results** for features `T`/`P` during `W`; presence of expected cyclic/event‑driven triggers.
**M6 Conclude.** If Results show the expected executions with no missed cycles beyond tolerance, `holds( plays_role(PLC_7, τ:IEC) @ W ) with γ≈0.8`.
*Trip-wire.* Do **not** restate this as “PROV Activity” without **F.9**; keep the assignment/status claim IEC-local.

### 10.3 Dataset accuracy status (ISO/IEC 25024 + KD‑CAL)

**Context.** *ISO/IEC 25024 (data‑quality; design)*
\**Template (Status).* `accuracy≥0.98` anchored at **SenseCell** ⟨ISO25024, “data accuracy”⟩.

**M1 Locate.** `address(τ)=⟨ISO25024, data‑accuracy⟩`
**M2 Stance.** `stance(Context)=design`, `stance(τ)=design` ⇒ compatible.
**M3 Qualify.** Subject `Dataset D` has a defined **reference set** and sampling protocol.
**M4 Assert.** `has_status(D, τ:ISO25024) @ W` where `W = “snapshot v2025‑04”`.
**M5 Evidence shape Σ(ISO25024).** **Observation** of correctness of sampled records vs reference, **Procedure** per standard, **Result** as proportion correct with confidence interval.
**M6 Conclude.** If CI lower bound ≥ 0.98, `holds( has_status(D, τ) @ W ) with γ≈0.85`.

---

### 10.4 Access vs behavioural: two claims, two Contexts

**Contexts.** *NIST RBAC (access; design)* and *BPMN 2.0 (workflow; design)*.
**Templates.** `DB‑Admin (RBAC status)` vs `Participant (BPMN role)`.

**RBAC claim (Status).**
M1…M6 yield `has_status(User U, RBAC:DB‑Admin) @ W_dir` with Σ(RBAC) = **Observation** of assignment state in the access model at time `W_dir`.

**BPMN claim (Role).**
M1…M6 yield `plays_role(Team T, BPMN:Participant) @ W_proc` with Σ(BPMN) = **Observation** that lanes/pools enact tasks during `W_proc`.

**Lesson.** Two separate **context-local** claims — one **Status assertion** and one **Role assignment**; **no** implication that holding RBAC status entails playing the BPMN Role.

## 11 · Relations (with other patterns)

**Builds on:**
F.1 **Domain‑Family Landscape Survey** (Contexts fixed); F.2 **Term Harvesting** (local terms); F.3 **Intra‑Context Clustering** (SenseCells); F.4 **Role Description** (invariants, stance); F.5 **Naming Discipline** (labels).

**Constrains:**
**F.7** (Concept-Set Table): rows reference **SenseCells**; Role Description cards **point to** those rows but never **create** cross-context identity.
**F.8 Mint or Reuse?** Uses outcomes of **Role/Status** claims to decide: a new **Role/Status** label only when existing Templates cannot express the claim with eligibility/Window adjustments.
**F.9** (Alignment & Bridge): any relation across Contexts is **declared there**; Role Description cards remain context-local.
**F.10 Epistemic Status Mapping.** Consumes **M6** confidences γ and Σ‑adequacy to roll up assurance.

**Coordinates with.** **MM‑CHR** (characteristics, scales) wherever *Characteristic/Scale* is used in evidence shapes.

**Used by.**
Architheories (Part C) to anchor their examples: Sys‑CAL (execution/actuation roles), KD‑CAL (measurement statuses), Method‑CAL (execution claims for Methods/MethodDescription), Kind-CAL (typing claims remain outside Role Assignment & Enactment, but may inform eligibility predicates).

## 12 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **Template refactor.** If a Template’s invariants change, **claims remain as‑is**; re‑evaluate **M6** on demand. Do not silently rewrite past claims.
2. **Edition updates.** When a Context’s canon updates, treat it as a **new Context** if sense shifts; Claims anchored to the old Context stay valid for their Window.
3. **Name revisions.** Renaming per F.5 does not alter **address(τ)=⟨Context, SenseCell⟩**; claims reference the address, not surface form.
4. **Bridge introduction.** Adding an **F.9 Bridge** never upgrades an existing Role/Status claim; at most it enables *separate* translations with declared loss.
5. **From exception to Status.** If recurring exceptions to a Role appear, prefer minting a **Status** Template that marks the exception rather than proliferating Roles.
6. **Window tightening.** If evidence shows drift, narrow future **Windows**; past claims remain tied to their original Windows.

---

## 13 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

### 13.1 Static conformance (SCR)

* **SCR-F6-S01 (Local address).** Every assignment/status claim states `address(τ)=σ` where `σ` is a **SenseCell** (per F.3); no bare labels.
* **SCR‑F6‑S02 (SenseFamily clarity).** Each claim is typed **Role** or **Status**, never both; subjects are of the correct kind. Claim records both **senseFamily** and **stance** explicitly or by inheritance.
* **SCR‑F6‑S03 (Stance compatibility).** `stance(Context)` and `stance(τ)` are compatible (design/run).
* **SCR‑F6‑S04 (Eligibility first).** For each claim, `eligible(H, τ@context)` is derivable prior to assertion.
* **SCR‑F6‑S05 (Window explicit).** Each claim has a Window (explicit or inherited) consistent with stance.
* **SCR‑F6‑S06 (Evidence‑ability).** For each claim, an **evidence shape Σ(Context)** is stated using only that Context’s vocabulary plus KD‑CAL/MM‑CHR primitives.
* **SCR‑F6‑S07 (Locality guard).** No Cross‑context terms appear inside a claim; any reference to other Contexts is flagged as **F.9 Bridge (informative)**, not used to justify the claim.

### 13.2 Regression (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F6‑E01 (Edition stability).** Adding a new edition/Context does not mutate existing claims’ Contexts or Windows.
* **RSCR‑F6‑E02 (Name stability).** Changing labels per F.5 leaves addresses and conclusions invariant.
* **RSCR‑F6‑E03 (Bridge neutrality).** Introducing or revising an **F.9 Bridge** does not auto‑flip claim truth values; at most it enables explicit translations with loss notes.
* **RSCR‑F6‑E04 (Evidence refresh).** When KD‑CAL procedures or **MM‑CHR characteristic scales** change, only **γ** is re‑evaluated; the claim’s semantics remain.

## 14 · Didactic distillation (60‑second recap)

> **Six moves.** (M1) *Locate* the Context & SenseCell; (M2) check **stance**; (M3) test **eligibility**; (M4) **bind/assert** with a **Window**; (M5) sketch the **evidence shape** in that Context; (M6) **conclude** with confidence γ.
> **Two iron rules.** Keep it **context‑local**; keep **Role** and **Status** on their senseFamily.
> **Pay-off.** Assignment/status claims become small, auditable thoughts: easy to teach, easy to check, and easy to relate—later—via explicit Bridges when you truly must step between Contexts.

# F.7 — Concept‑Set Table \[A]

**“Show one thing across Contexts—only where explicit bridges allow it.”**

**Status.** Architectural pattern \[A], architheory‑agnostic.
**Depends on.** E.10.D1 **Lexical Discipline for ‘Context’** (Context ≡ `U.BoundedContext`); **F.0.1 senseFamily (normative)**; F.1 **Domain‑Family Landscape Survey**; F.2 **Term Harvesting**; F.3 **Intra‑Context Sense Clustering** (SenseCells); F.5 **Naming Discipline**; F.9 **Alignment & Bridge Across Contexts**.
**Coordinates with.** F.4 **Role Description**; F.6 **Role Assignment & Enactment Cycle (Six-Step)**; Part C architheories (for examples), **MM‑CHR (for Characteristic)**.
**Aliases (informative).** *Concept‑Set table*, *comparison grid*.

---

## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **single, didactic page** where each **row** presents **one Concept‑Set**—a *set of SenseCells from different Contexts that we are licensed (by explicit Bridges) to treat as “the same for a stated scope”*. Columns are **Contexts**; cells carry **local labels**. The table **does not invent equivalences**: it **summarises** already declared **F.9 Bridges**, exposing *scope, losses, and counter‑examples* at a glance.

**Applicability.** Use whenever cross-context reading is necessary (naming U.Types, teaching contrasts, assignment/enactment-adjacent terminology). It is a **reading lens**, not a data model: **notation-free**, **governance-free**, **Context-loyal**.

**Non‑goals.** No hidden merges. No “global terms”. No workflows or tool schemas. The table is a **conceptual display** of *licensed sameness* and *honest non‑sameness*.

---

## 2 · Problem frame

Without a disciplined Cross‑context view:

1. **Silent equivalence.** Readers assume sameness by name alone (e.g., *process*).
2. **Loss denial.** Mappings hide what is dropped (temporal stance, units, agency).
3. **Name inflation.** New U.Types are coined to avoid facing heterogeneity.
4. **Cognitive scatter.** Concepts drift across documents without one compact, teachable “where‑what‑how‑same” view.

---

## 3 · Forces

| Force                          | Tension to resolve                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Locality vs comparison**     | Meaning lives in Contexts; yet we must **compare** Contexts to reason across disciplines.                           |
| **Didactics vs fidelity**      | A compact row is easy to grasp; it must still show **scope and loss** honestly.                               |
| **Simplicity vs completeness** | A minimal grid aids memory; temptation to overload it with proofs and procedures must be resisted.            |
| **Sameness vs difference**     | Some families **cannot** be unified; the table must support **contrast rows** without pretending equivalence. |

---

## 4 · Core idea (didactic)

A **Concept‑Set** is a **finite set of addresses**

$$
\text{CS}=\{\langle \text{Context}_i,\ \text{SenseCell}_i\rangle\}_{i=1..n}
$$

that FPF **treats as one** *for a declared scope* because there exist **F.9 Bridges** connecting these SenseCells pairwise (directly or via a short chain) with **congruence level** $\text{CL}$ above a **threshold** suitable for that scope. The **table row** shows:

* **FPF Label** *(Tech/Plain)* — the *didactic, FPF‑level* name chosen per F.5.
* **Row Scope** — where “being one” is safe (e.g., *Naming-only*, *assignment/enactment-eligibility*, *KD-CAL metric*, *Type‑structure*).
* **Row CL(min)** — the **minimum CL** of the Bridges that justify the row.
* **Context columns** — each cell: the **local label** + (optional) short cue.
* **Rationale (one line)** — why sameness is warranted *for this scope*.
* **Counter‑examples (one line)** — where/why sameness **breaks**.

> **Memory hook.** *A Concept‑Set row is a promise:* “You may **read across** these Contexts **this far—and no farther**.”

---

## 5 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Context** — shorthand for `U.BoundedContext` (per E.10.D1).
* **senseFamily** — **referenced from F.0.1**; not redefined here; used to **type** rows and to require **uniformity** within a row.
* **SenseCell** — a **(Context × Local‑Sense)** address from F.3.
* **Bridge (F.9)** — an explicit, declarative Cross‑context mapping with a **congruence level** **CL** and **loss note**.
* **Characteristic (MM‑CHR)** — measurable comparandum defined in **MM‑CHR**; may be referenced in **Measurement/KD‑metric** rows; **do not** use “axis” as a euphemism.
* **Concept‑Set (row)** — a *licensed sameness* across Contexts, bounded by **Row Scope** and **Row CL(min)**.
* **Contrast row** — a *non‑sameness* row: same surface across Contexts with **no** sufficient Bridges; teaches **difference**, not unity.

---

## 6 · The table (conceptual layout)

> One page. Fixed column order by Context. Each row fits in **five lines** max.

```
FPF Label (Tech / Plain) | Row Scope | Row CL(min) | [Context A] local label | [Context B] local label | [Context C] local label | Rationale | Counter‑examples
```

**Reading rules (didactic):**

1. **Cells are local.** A cell is **not** a translation; it is the Context’s **own** label for its SenseCell.
2. **Scope is king.** The FPF label only licenses sameness **within its Row Scope**. Outside that scope, treat cells as **different**.
3. **Row CL(min) governs trust.** Lower CL ⇒ narrower applicability; **never** up‑scope a row without revisiting Bridges.
4. **Rationale & counter‑examples** are **obligatory one‑liners**; if you need paragraphs, you need an F.9 walkthrough, not a row.

**Didactic name rationale** “Giants' table’” that alludes to *standing on the shoulders of giants*: each row explicitly leans on authoritative context of meaning (**U.BoundedContext**) established by prior disciplines and not imagined. It does **not** mean a physically large table; the name signals epistemic humility and traceable reliance on those sources. "We are like dwarfs on the shoulders of giants, so that we can see more than they, and things at a greater distance, not by virtue of any sharpness of sight on our part, or any physical distinction, but because we are carried high and raised up by their giant size." by Bernard of Chartres , d. c.1130, French philosopher.

## 7 · Conceptual construction (thought moves, not workflow)

> The table is derived from earlier patterns; it **creates nothing new**.

* **Sourcing.** Candidate cells come **only** from **SenseCells** (F.3).
* **Licensing.** A row exists **iff** the relevant **Bridges (F.9)** already justify sameness at the chosen **Row Scope**.
* **Bounding.** Prefer **2–4 Contexts** per row (parsimony); add more only if each adds a *distinct necessity* for the sameness claim.
* **Typing.** A row is **typed by senseFamily**: Role, Status, Type‑structure, Measurement, etc. **Do not mix senseFamilies** in one row.
* **Temporal honesty.** A row’s cells must share **compatible design/run stance**; if not, either split into two rows or mark a **contrast row**.

---

## 8 · Invariants (normative)

1. **Context‑loyal cells.** Every non‑empty cell is a **SenseCell** address; no minted paraphrases.
2. **Bridge sufficiency.** For a *Concept‑Set* row, **every pair** of filled cells is connected by an **F.9 Bridge path** whose **bottleneck CL** ≥ **Row CL(min)** printed for the row.
3. **Scope declaration.** Each row **MUST** declare a **Row Scope** chosen from a small controlled set (e.g., *Naming-only*, *assignment/enactment-eligibility*, *KD-metric*, *Type-structure*).
4. **senseFamily uniformity.** All cells in a row belong to the **same senseFamily** (Role **or** Status **or** Type-structure **or** Measurement…).
5. **Temporal compatibility.** Either all cells share the **same stance**, or the row is a **contrast row** (no sameness claim).
6. **Loss disclosure.** If any Bridge in the row has a **loss note**, the row **MUST** include a **counter‑example** that illustrates that loss in one line.
7. **No stealth expansion.** Adding a new cell to a row **MUST NOT** lower the printed **Row CL(min)** without updating **Row Scope** or splitting the row.
8. **Parsimony.** A row with only one filled cell is **forbidden** (that would be local talk, not a Cross‑context concept).
9. **Didactic bound.** A row that cannot be read in **≤ 30 seconds** violates didactic primacy and must be split.

## 9 · Micro‑illustrations (safe patterns)

> Illustrative only; these presume corresponding **F.9 Bridges** exist with stated CL and losses.

**(a) Subtyping across type‑formalisms (Type‑structure row)**

| FPF Label                                  | Row Scope      | Row CL(min) | OWL 2             | Kind-CAL            | Rationale                                                        | Counter‑examples                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **is‑a (Tech)** / *type hierarchy* (Plain) | Type‑structure | CL = 3      | `rdfs:subClassOf` | `U.SubtypeRelation` | Both are partial‑order *class* subsumption used for inheritance. | FCA *concept* order is not a class subsumption; keep it out or CL drops. |

**(b) “Observation result value” (Measurement row)**

| FPF Label                           | Row Scope | Row CL(min) | SOSA/SSN                | ISO 80000‑1                    | ITIL 4                       | Rationale                                                                                           | Counter‑examples                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **result‑value** / *measured value* | KD‑metric | CL = 2      | `sosa:Result` (literal) | `QuantityValue` (unit‑bearing) | *metric value* (service KPI) | Values can be read as numbers tied to a Characteristic; ITIL metric uses same notion when unitised. | ITIL “metric” may be composite indices (loss of unit fidelity). |

**(c) Contrast row: “process” (no sameness)**

| FPF Label              | Row Scope | Row CL(min) | BPMN 2.0              | PROV‑O                  | Thermodynamics           | Rationale                                                 | Counter‑examples                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **process** (contrast) | —         | —           | *graph of flow nodes* | *time‑bounded activity* | *state‑space trajectory* | Same surface, **different** senses; no licensed sameness. | Any attempt to equate design‑graph with run‑occurrence fails stance compatibility. |


## 10 · Anti‑patterns & remedies

| #         | Anti‑pattern                | Symptom in a row                                                               | Why it breaks thinking                                               | Remedy (conceptual move)                                                                                          |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AP‑1**  | **Bridge‑free sameness**    | Cells listed as “same” because their labels look alike; no cited Bridges.      | Violates locality; imports meaning across Contexts by name.             | A row **exists only** if backed by **F.9 Bridges**. Otherwise produce a **contrast row**.                         |
| **AP-2**  | **Scope creep**             | Row labelled “Type-structure” but used to justify **assignment/enactment-eligibility** or KD metrics. | Scope licences are not transferable; inference leaks.                | Keep a **small controlled set of Row Scopes**. If use widens, **mint a new row** or **re-bridge** with higher CL. |
| **AP‑3**  | **senseFamily mixing**      | One row mixes Role, Status, Measurement, and Type‑structure cells.             | Conflates senseFamily (F.0.1); readers cannot tell “what kind of sameness”. | **Type each row.** If two senseFamilys are needed, **split** into two rows.                                             |
| **AP‑4**  | **Temporal blur**           | Cells with incompatible design/run stance declared “same”.                     | Design artefacts ≠ run occurrences; claims invert.                   | Either **harmonise stance** (choose only compatible cells) or publish a **contrast row**.                         |
| **AP‑5**  | **Loss denial**             | Bridges carry loss notes, but the row omits counter‑examples.                  | Readers over‑trust; misuse outside safe scope.                       | Add a **one‑line counter‑example** that illustrates the loss.                                                     |
| **AP‑6**  | **CL averaging**            | Row CL(min) computed as an average of heterogeneous Bridges.                   | The weakest link governs; averages overstate safety.                 | Row CL(min) is the **bottleneck** (minimum along connecting paths).                                               |
| **AP‑7**  | **Overwide rows**           | 6–8 Contexts in one row; hard to read; subtle mismatches hide.                    | Violates didactic primacy; invites hidden losses.                    | **Parsimony**: 2–4 Contexts per row unless each extra cell has a **distinct necessity** you can state in one line.   |
| **AP‑8**  | **Minted paraphrases**      | Cells reword a Context’s label instead of citing the SenseCell.                   | Hides locality; future drift becomes invisible.                      | **Cells are Context‑loyal.** Use the Context’s own SenseCell label.                                                     |
| **AP‑9**  | **Duplicate rows by style** | Two rows with the same cell set but different FPF labels.                      | Name inflation; readers assume two distinct concepts.                | Keep **one row** per Concept‑Set per scope. Alternative labels appear as **aliases** in F.5, not new rows.        |
| **AP‑10** | **Implied transitivity**    | A↔B and B↔C Bridges exist; row silently assumes A↔C at the same CL.            | Paths can reduce CL; semantics might not compose.                    | Compute CL for **A↔C via bottleneck**; if too low, either reduce **Row Scope** or **omit** the cell.              |

## 11 · Worked examples (multi‑architheory)

> Each example gives a **row** (compact), then a **reading** explaining scope and limits. All sameness claims presuppose suitable **F.9 Bridges** with the stated CL.

### 11.1 Behavioural actor across Contexts (naming‑only)

| FPF Label (Tech / Plain)              | Row Scope   | Row CL(min) | BPMN 2.0        | PROV‑O    | Rationale                                                                               | Counter‑examples                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **actor** / *party that participates* | Naming‑only | CL = 2      | **Participant** | **Agent** | Both denote a bearer that can be named as the party to which activities are attributed. | PROV **Agent** includes software agents; BPMN **Participant** is typically an organisation lane/pool. |

**Reading.** The row licenses a **glossary‑level sameness** for didactic prose (“the actor”). It does **not** license modelling **identity** or inference across Contexts.

### 11.5 Contrast: “role” (access vs behaviour)

| FPF Label           | Row Scope | Row CL(min) | NIST RBAC                 | BPMN 2.0                                 | Rationale                                                      | Counter‑examples                                                                   |

| **role** (contrast) | —         | —           | **Role** (permission set) | **Participant/Actor** (behavioural mask) | Same surface; **different senseFamilys** (Status vs Role/behaviour). | Any attempt to unify collapses deontics into behaviour; stance and effects differ. |

**Reading.** This row **teaches difference**; it deliberately **does not** license sameness.

---

## 12 · Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas, notation‑free)

> All judgements are **pure** (no side effects). “Contexts” are `U.BoundedContext`. `SC(C)` denotes a SenseCell in Context `C`. `CL(X↔Y)` is the congruence level of the **best** Bridge path (F.9) between SenseCells `X` and `Y` (bottleneck along that path).

### 12.1 Row licensing

**Form.**
`S = {SC(C₁), …, SC(Cₙ)}, Scope = s, τ(s) = requiredCL ⊢ licensable(S,s) ⇔ (∀ i<j: CL(SC(Cᵢ)↔SC(Cⱼ)) ≥ requiredCL ∧ senseFamily (S) is uniform ∧ stance(S) compatible)`

**Reading.** A set of cells **licenses** a row of scope `s` iff every pair is bridged at or above the **required CL** for that scope, all cells sit in the **same senseFamily**, and **temporal stance** is compatible.

---

### 12.2 Bottleneck CL for a row

**Form.**
`RowCL(S) = min_{i<j} CL(SC(Cᵢ)↔SC(Cⱼ))`

**Reading.** The row’s CL is the **minimum** congruence level across all pairs (the weakest link).

---

### 12.3 Scope guard

**Form.**
`licensable(S,s) ∧ s ⊑ s' ⊢ licensable(S,s') only if RowCL(S) ≥ τ(s')`

**Reading.** You may **tighten scope** (use the row for a stronger purpose) only if the row’s CL meets the **higher threshold** for that scope.

---

### 12.4 Contrast decision

**Form.**
`(∃ i<j: CL(SC(Cᵢ)↔SC(Cⱼ)) < τ(Naming‑only)) ⊢ publish‑contrast(S)`

**Reading.** If even **Naming‑only** cannot be licensed, publish a **contrast row** instead of forcing sameness.

---

### 12.5 Row extension guard

**Form.**
`licensable(S,s) ∧ add SC(Cₖ) ⊢ licensable(S∪{SC(Cₖ)}, s) iff ∀ i: CL(SC(Cᵢ)↔SC(Cₖ)) ≥ τ(s)`

**Reading.** You may add a new cell only if it bridges to **every existing cell** at the row’s scope.

---

### 12.6 Loss disclosure obligation

**Form.**
`licensable(S,s) ∧ (∃ i<j: lossNote on Bridge(SC(Cᵢ),SC(Cⱼ))) ⊢ row must carry ≥1 counter‑example`

**Reading.** Any loss note on any supporting Bridge obliges the row to include a **counter‑example one‑liner**.

---

## 13 · Relations (with other patterns)

**Builds on:**
F.1 **Contexts fixed** → defines the column set; F.2 **Harvest** → supplies term material; F.3 **SenseCells** → provide cell addresses; F.5 **Naming Discipline** → provides the two‑register **FPF labels**; F.9 **Bridges** → legally justify each row.

**Constrains:**
F.4 **Role Description** — when a template cites an FPF label from the table, it **inherits the Row Scope**; no template may claim semantics beyond the row’s licence.
F.6 **Role Assignment & Enactment Cycle (Six-Step)** — Move M‑4 (“choose label”) must reference a row if it wants Cross‑context reading.

**Used by.**
Part C architheories for didactic alignment pages; Part B trust calculus (B.3) may consume **Row CL(min)** when computing translation penalties.

---

## 14 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **Bridge update.** If any supporting Bridge’s CL changes, recompute **Row CL(min)**. If it drops below the printed value, either **lower Row Scope**, **split** the row, or **retire** it.
2. **New Context appears.** Do **not** auto‑expand rows. Test with **12.5**; add only if it brings a **distinct necessity**.
3. **Sense revision inside a Context.** If a SenseCell splits (F.3), decide which child cell (if any) remains in the row; the rest may require **new rows** or a **contrast**.
4. **Scope promotion.** To use a row for a stronger purpose (e.g., from **Naming-only** to **assignment/enactment-eligibility**), first ensure **Row CL(min) ≥ τ(new scope)**; otherwise construct **new Bridges** or **decline** promotion.
5. **Deprecation.** If a row no longer meets its invariant, mark its FPF label as **retired** in F.5 and point to successor rows (if any).
6. **Edition churn.** When a Context is superseded (F.1), either keep the cell (if semantics stable) or treat the successor as a **new Context** and re‑evaluate licensability.

---

## 15 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

### 15.1 Static conformance checks (SCR)

* **SCR‑F7‑S01 (Context‑loyal cells).** Every non‑empty cell references an existing **SenseCell** (F.3) in a declared Context (F.1).
* **SCR‑F7‑S02 (Closure & bottleneck).** For each Concept‑Set row, **every pair** of cells has a Bridge path with CL ≥ **Row CL(min)** printed; **Row CL(min)** equals the **minimum** pairwise CL.
* **SCR‑F7‑S03 (Typed & scoped).** Each row declares a **Row Scope** from the controlled set and is **senseFamily‑uniform** (Role **or** Status **or** Measurement **or** Type‑structure…).
* **SCR‑F7‑S04 (Temporal compatibility).** Non‑contrast rows have **compatible** design/run stance across cells.
* **SCR‑F7‑S05 (Loss disclosure).** If any supporting Bridge has a recorded loss, the row includes **≥1 counter‑example** line.
* **SCR‑F7‑S06 (Parsimony).** Rows contain **2–4 Contexts** unless a one‑line necessity is stated for each extra Context.

### 15.2 Regression checks (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F7‑E01 (Bridge drift).** After any Bridge change (F.9), recompute **Row CL(min)**; flag rows whose scope is now overstated.
* **RSCR‑F7‑E02 (Sense split).** After a SenseCell splits (F.3), ensure rows referencing it either pick a child cell or retire.
* **RSCR‑F7‑E03 (Scope integrity).** No consumer pattern uses a row outside its declared **Row Scope**.
* **RSCR‑F7‑E04 (No stealth growth).** Additions of cells never lower **Row CL(min)** silently; if they do, either split the row or reduce scope.

---

## 16 · Didactic distillation (60‑second teaching script)

> “A **Concept-Set row** shows **one idea across Contexts**—but only where explicit **Bridges** license it. Columns are Contexts; cells are **their own labels**. The row prints a **scope** (‘Naming-only’, ‘assignment/enactment-eligibility’, ‘Type-structure’, ‘KD-metric’) and the **weakest CL** that justifies reading across. A **one‑line rationale** says why sameness is safe **here**; a **counter‑example** warns where it breaks. Keep rows small (2–4 Contexts), typed (don’t mix senseFamilies), and temporally honest (design vs run stance). If Bridges don’t suffice, publish a **contrast row** instead. The table doesn’t invent meaning; it **summarises licensed sameness** so readers can cross disciplines without smuggling assumptions.”

# F.8 — Mint or Reuse? (U.Type vs Concept-Set vs Role Description vs Alias) \[A] 

**“Name only what thinking **requires**, and reuse everything else.”**

**Status.** Architectural pattern \[A], architheory‑agnostic.
**Depends on.** E.10.D1 **Lexical Discipline for “Context” (D.CTX)**; A.7 **Strict Distinction**; A.11 **Ontological Parsimony**; A.8 **Universal Core**.
**Coordinates with.** F.1 **Contexts (Contexts)**; F.2 **Harvest**; F.3 **SenseCells**; F.4 **Role Description**; F.5 **Naming Discipline**; F.7 **Concept‑Set Table**; F.9 **Alignment & Bridge**.
**Aliases (informative).** *Mint‑vs‑Reuse gate*; *Naming governor*.

---

## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **minimal, conceptual decision lattice** that answers, for any modelling need:

> “Do I **reuse** an existing label, add an **alias**, reference a **Concept‑Set row**, define a **Role Description**, or mint a **new U.Type**?”

The lattice enforces **locality of meaning** (Contexts), **senseFamily separation** (A.7), and **parsimony** (A.11) while remaining didactically simple.

**Applicability.** Use whenever a new name seems “needed” in any architheory thread (**Role Assignment & Enactment**, Sys-CAL, KD-CAL, Kind-CAL, Method-CAL, LCA-CAL…).

**Non‑goals.** No workflows, no roles, no storage. This is **thinking discipline**, not process guidance.

---

## 2 · Problem frame

Modellers tend to **mint names** when they actually need **reuse**, **aliasing**, or **explicit Cross‑context reading**. Consequences:

1. **Name inflation.** Parallel labels for the same idea across Contexts.
2. **senseFamily mixing.** Behavioural **Role** names that smuggle in deontic **Status** or measurement talk.
3. **Hidden bridges.** Cross‑context sameness is implied by look‑alike words rather than declared (F.9).
4. **Kernel sprawl.** New **U.Types** appear to plaster over local vocabulary gaps.

---

## 3 · Forces

| Force                       | Tension to resolve                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parsimony vs coverage**   | Avoid new names unless necessary, yet cover recurring Cross‑context readings.                    |
| **Locality vs unification** | Keep senses **in‑Context**; when reading across, do it **explicitly** and only as far as needed. |
| **Didactics vs fidelity**   | Give readers one label to hold, but never over‑state sameness (respect CL and scope).         |

---

## 4 · Minimal vocabulary (used in this pattern only)

* **Context** — `U.BoundedContext` (per D.CTX).
* **SenseCell** — address of a **local sense** produced by F.3 (one context × one clustered sense).
* **Concept‑Set row** — a **licensed Cross‑context reading** (F.7) of cells in one senseFamily with a declared **Row Scope** and **Row CL(min)**.
* **senseFamily** — as defined in **F.0.1**; here used as the **typed discriminator for rows** restricted to {Role | Status | Measurement | Type‑structure | Method | Execution}. 
* **Role Description** — a **Role/Status** template anchored to a **single SenseCell** (F.4).
* **Alias** — an **additional label** for an existing FPF label (within F.5), no new semantics.
* **CL threshold τ(scope)** — the **minimum congruence level** needed for a row’s scope (e.g., τ(Naming-only) < τ(Assignment-eligibility) < τ(Type-structure)).

---

## 5 · The decision lattice (conceptual, notation‑free)

> Read top‑to‑bottom; the **first satisfied** branch decides. At every step, **state the senseFamily** (Role / Status / Measurement / Type‑structure / Method / Execution) before you proceed.

### Q0 — What is the **senseFamily** of your need?

* If **uncertain**, return to F.1/F.3: stabilise the Context(s) and the local sense.
* If **mixed**, split the need: one decision **per senseFamily** (A.7).

### Q1 — Is there a **single Context** whose SenseCell already expresses it?

* **Yes →** **Reuse** the **SenseCell**’s label **inside that Context**.

  * If you need assignable behaviour or deontics on that sense: **define a Role Description** **anchored to that SenseCell** (F.4).
* **No →** go to Q2.

> *Example (engineer).* You want “**task execution**” in control software. In `IEC 61131‑3` there is a clear SenseCell for **task execution**. **Reuse** that label; if you need responsibilities (“who monitors runs”), define a **Role Description** anchored to this SenseCell.

### Q2 — Do you need to **read across Contexts** (same senseFamily)?

* **No →** stay within one context; if your desire is merely a nicer label, consider an **Alias** (Q3).
* **Yes →** check F.7 for a **Concept‑Set row** covering your cells **in this senseFamily** with adequate **Row Scope** and **Row CL(min)**.

  * **Found & sufficient →** **Reuse the row’s FPF label** at that scope.
  * **Not found or insufficient →** either (a) **publish a contrast** (teach difference), or (b) propose a **new row** but only after F.9 Bridges exist at **τ(scope)**.

> *Example (manager).* You want one label for the **actor** in workflow and provenance prose. F.7 has a **Naming‑only** row mapping *BPMN Participant* ↔ *PROV Agent* at CL = 2. **Reuse** “actor” **at Naming‑only** scope; do **not** infer identity in models.

### Q3 — Is this **only a wording preference** for an existing FPF label?

* **Yes →** add an **Alias** in F.5 (Tech register and/or Plain register), no semantics changed.
* **No →** go to Q4.

> *Example (researcher).* You prefer “**is‑a**” to “**subclass‑of**” in Type pages. That is an **Alias** for the same concept; no new row, no new U.Type.

### Q4 — Does your need recur across Contexts in a way **not captured** by current rows, **with Bridges** already available at the required CL?

* **Yes →** propose a **new Concept‑Set row** (F.7): small (2–4 Contexts), **one senseFamily**, declare **Row Scope** and **Row CL(min)**, include a **counter‑example** if any Bridge has loss notes.
* **No →** go to Q5.

> *Example (engineer).* You repeatedly compare **runtime occurrence** in PROV with **PLC task runs**. F.9 Bridges exist at CL = 2. Propose **row “execution-occurrence”** at **assignment/enactment-eligibility** scope (not Type-structure).

### Q5 — Are you describing a **kernel‑level notion** missing from the catalogue, **not** reducible to existing rows or Role Descriptions, and **present across ≥ 3 domain families** (A.8)?

* **Yes →** propose a **new U.Type** (rare). Supply:
  (i) the minimal **intensional definition**; (ii) cross‑family evidence (≥ 3 Contexts, **distinct families**); (iii) how it **doesn’t** duplicate an existing U.Type.
* **No →** you **do not mint** a new type. Re‑express the need in terms of **Context reuse**, **row reuse**, **Alias**, or a **Role Description**.

> *Example (researcher).* You think we need **U.InfluenceEdge** (causal tendency). If it appears as a stable, **senseFamily‑specific** notion across **control**, **epistemic inference**, and **methods** (≥ 3 families), and cannot be formed from existing `U.Relation` subtypes, it **may** qualify. Otherwise, treat it as a **pattern** or a **row**.

---

## 6 · Scope thresholds (default τ) — **how much sameness** you’re allowed to claim

| Row / Use Scope     | What it licenses                                                                              | Default τ (minimum CL) | Typical consumers                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------: | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Naming‑only**     | Shared label in prose, diagrams, and primers; **no inference**.                               |                  **1** | Pedagogy, glossary, didactic figures.     |
| **Assignment-eligibility** | Safe to reference the row’s target as the **thing a `U.RoleAssignment` may point to** (e.g., a run, a value). | **2** | F.4 Role Description, acceptance narratives. |
| **KD‑metric**       | Treat cells as the **same measured outcome** (unit‑compatible, procedure‑compatible).         |                  **2** | Measurement summaries, SLO tables.        |
| **Type‑structure**  | Treat cells as the **same structural relation** (e.g., subtyping) with inheritance semantics. |                  **3** | Kind-CAL pages, structural proofs.        |

> **Guard.** You may **tighten** scope (e.g., from Naming-only → Assignment-eligibility) **only** if the **Row CL(min)** meets the **higher τ**.

---

## 7 · Micro‑examples (didactic triad)

### 7.1 For engineers — “Do we need a new **Execution** label?”

* **Need.** “We want to refer to **what actually happened** in both provenance logs and PLC runtime.”
* **senseFamily.** Execution · **stance.** run.
* **Contexts.** `PROV‑O` (Activity), `IEC 61131‑3` (task run).
* **Row?** F.7 has **execution-occurrence** at **assignment/enactment-eligibility**, CL = 2.
* **Decision.** **Reuse** that row’s label at **Assignment-eligibility**; **no** new U.Type; define Role Descriptions **anchored to each Context** as needed.

### 7.2 For managers — “Can we call them all **actors**?”

* **Need.** A single everyday word in the spec to denote “the responsible party”.
* **senseFamily.** Role (behavioural mask in prose).
* **Contexts.** `BPMN 2.0` (Participant), `PROV‑O` (Agent).
* **Row?** **Naming‑only** row “actor”, CL = 2.
* **Decision.** **Reuse** “actor” **in prose only**; keep Context‑loyal labels in formal sections. No Role Description minted unless tied to one context.

### 7.3 For researchers — “New **U.Type** for ‘Work Scope’?”

* **Need.** Kernel notion capturing **feasible performance region** across systems.
* **Test A.8.** Appears in **control** (reachable sets), **services** (operating envelope), **measurement** (confidence bands): **≥ 3 families?**
* **Reduction test.** Can it be expressed as a **row** + existing `U.Relation` + KD‑CAL constructs?
* **Decision.** If **not reducible** and **cross‑family stable**, propose **new U.Type** with minimal definition; otherwise, prefer a **row** or a **pattern**.

---

## 8 · Invariants (normative, lightweight)

1. **Context‑first.** Every decision cites at least one **Context**; no global senses.
2. **senseFamily purity.** A single decision covers **one senseFamily**. Mixed needs are split.
3. **Row honesty.** Any Cross‑context reuse occurs **via a Concept‑Set row** at or above **τ(scope)**; no stealth equivalence.
4. **Role Description anchoring.** Role Descriptions are **single-Context**, **single-cell** anchors (F.4).
5. **Alias modesty.** Aliases **never** change semantics and live under F.5.
6. **Kernel restraint.** New **U.Types** are **rare**; A.8 **(≥ 3 families)** is mandatory, and duplication with existing U.Types must be ruled out.

| --------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **AP‑1**  | **Row‑less sameness**      | Declaring “these mean the same” across Contexts without citing a **Concept‑Set row**. | Imports meaning implicitly; no CL guard.           | If Cross‑context reuse is desired, **reuse an existing row** at a declared **scope** (F.7), else **publish the contrast** and defer to F.9 Bridges. |
| **AP-2**  | **Scope creep**            | Using a **Naming-only** row to justify **Assignment-eligibility** or structural inferences. | Over-claims sameness; breaks τ(scope).             | Respect **scope thresholds** (τ).

| **AP‑3**  | **Alias with payload**     | Introducing an Alias that subtly changes intent or senseFamily.                          | Hides semantics behind wording; confuses senseFamilies.   | Aliases (F.5) are **style only**.

| **AP-4**  | **Role-Description-to-row anchoring** | Role Description points to a **row** rather than a **single SenseCell**.       | Masks locality; **assignments** become cross-context by stealth. | Role Descriptions **must anchor to one SenseCell** (F.4). Use rows only in prose or aggregated views.                                                |
| **AP‑5**  | **Kernel inflation**       | Proposing a new **U.Type** because a convenient label is missing.                  | Duplicates the kernel; violates parsimony.         | Apply A.8: require **≥ 3 domain families** and **irreducibility**; otherwise **Alias** or **row**.                                               |
| **AP‑6**  | **senseFamily mixing**           | One name that conflates Role, Status, Measurement, or Type‑structure.              | Collapses A.7 Strict Distinction.                  | **Split by senseFamily** first (Q0). Decide **per senseFamily**.                                                                                             |
| **AP‑7**  | **Bridge‑by‑string**       | Treating identical surface forms as equivalent senses across Contexts.                | Homonym trap; ignores local sense.                 | Equivalence only via **F.9 Bridge** + **row**; never by string.                                                                                  |
| **AP‑8**  | **Row without loss notes** | Publishing a row where Bridges indicate mismatches, but row text is silent.        | Readers assume full equivalence.                   | Include **counter‑example** and **loss sketch** in the row’s narrative (F.7).                                                                    |
| **AP‑9**  | **CL laundering**          | Citing a high‑scope row based on old high CL while Bridges have since weakened.    | Invalidates downstream claims.                     | When CL falls below τ(scope), **downgrade row scope** (e.g., to Naming‑only) or **split row**.                                                   |

## 11 · Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas, notation‑free)

> Each item states a **mental entailment**. No storage, no roles, no workflows. Symbols: `C` = Context, `σ` = SenseCell, `R` = Concept‑Set row, `SF` = senseFamily, `τ` = scope threshold, `CL` = congruence level.

1. **senseFamily split**
   `need(n) ∧ mixedSF(n) ⊢ split(n) into {n₁…nₖ} by senseFamily`
   *You cannot decide for mixed senseFamilies; decide per senseFamily.*

2. **Cell reuse**
   `∃ C,σ : expresses(n,SF)@σ ⊢ reuseLabel(σ) in C`
   *If a single Context’s SenseCell already says it, reuse it locally.*

3. **Assignment-eligibility**
   `reuseLabel(σ) ∧ needAssignable(SF ∈ {Role,Status}) ⊢ mintRoleDescription(σ)`
   *When you need assignable behaviour/deontics for a local sense, mint a Role Description anchored to that sense.*

4. **Row reuse**
   `crossContexts(n,SF) ∧ ∃ R: covers(R,SF) ∧ CL(R) ≥ τ(scope) ⊢ reuseRow(R,scope)`
   *For Cross‑context readings, reuse a row at a scope whose τ is met.*

5. **Alias suffices**
   `sameIntent(n,label₀) ∧ stylePreference(n,label₁) ⊢ alias(label₀,label₁)`
   *If it’s only wording, add an Alias; no semantics move.*

6. **Row proposal**
   `recurrentCross(n,SF) ∧ bridgesCL(cells(n)) ≥ τ(scope) ∧ ¬∃R ⊢ proposeRow(cells,scope)`
   *If the need recurs and Bridges support the scope, propose a new row.*

7. **Kernel minting (rare)**
   `kernelCandidate(n) ∧ crossFamily≥3 ∧ irreducible(n) ⊢ proposeUType(n)`
   *Only if the notion is cross‑family and cannot be reduced to cells+rows+existing U.Types.*

8. **Scope downgrade**
   `reuseRow(R,scope) ∧ CL(R)↓ < τ(scope) ⊢ downgradeScope(R)`
   *If CL falls, lower the row’s licensed scope.*

9. **Row rejection**
   `conflictEvidence(rowCells) ∧ lossUnbounded ⊢ rejectRow`
   *If bridges show open‑ended loss, do not publish a row; teach the contrast.*

## 12 · Extended worked examples (multi‑architheory)

### 12.1 **Execution, observation, and acceptance** (engineers)

**Need.** A reusable label for “what actually happened and how it was checked against the promise”.
**senseFamilies.** Execution (stance: run); Measurement (KD); Status (accept/reject).

**Contexts.**
`IEC 61131‑3` (task run), `PROV‑O` (Activity), `SOSA/SSN` (Observation), `ITIL 4` (SLO/SLA).

**Reasoning.**

* `Execution`: `IEC` SenseCell (task run) and `PROV` SenseCell (Activity). There exists a **row** *execution-occurrence* at **Assignment-eligibility** with CL = 2 → **reuse row** at **Assignment-eligible** scope; do not infer Type-structure.
* `Measurement`: `SOSA` Observation cell; no Cross‑context needed → **reuse cell**.
* `Status`: `ITIL` SLO/SLA cell; **Role Description** “SLO‑Target” anchored to ITIL cell.

**Outcome.** Prose may say: “This **execution-occurrence** (row\@assignment/enactment-eligibility) was **observed** (SOSA cell) and **evaluated against the SLO** (ITIL cell).” No new U.Type; no hidden merges.

---

### 12.2 **Actor across workflow and provenance** (managers)

**Need.** A single everyday label for “the responsible party” in diagrams.
**senseFamily.** Role (behavioural mask in prose/diagrams).

**Contexts.** `BPMN 2.0` (Participant), `PROV‑O` (Agent).

**Reasoning.** A **Naming‑only** row “actor” exists, CL = 2. **Reuse the row** at Naming‑only.
If assignable behaviour is needed in a model, **mint Role Description** anchored to **BPMN Participant** (not to the row).

**Outcome.** Diagrams show “actor”; formal sections reference `Participant` or `Agent` as appropriate.

---

### 12.3 **Accuracy across metrology and data quality** (researchers)

**Need.** Treat “accuracy” consistently across ISO 80000 (metrology) and ISO/IEC 25024 (data quality).
**senseFamily.** Measurement.

**Contexts.** `ISO 80000‑1` (quantity/units), `ISO/IEC 25024` (data quality).

**Reasoning.** Bridges indicate **related but not identical** definitions; procedures differ. Existing **KD‑metric** row “accuracy” has CL = 2 with **loss note**: *population vs instrument focus*. **Reuse row** at KD‑metric scope for dashboards; **do not** use the row to justify interchange of procedures.

**Outcome.** One label in reports; method sections still cite the context‑local procedure.

---

### 12.4 **Subtype relation across OWL and a curated taxonomy** (formalists)

**Need.** Present “is‑a” uniformly across OWL 2 classes and a domain taxonomy.
**senseFamily.** Type‑structure.

**Contexts.** `OWL 2` (SubClassOf), `Taxonomy_X` (curated “is‑a” edges).

**Reasoning.** F.7 row “subtype‑order” exists at **Type‑structure scope** with CL = 3 (only after verifying acyclicity & anti‑symmetry in `Taxonomy_X`). If the curated taxonomy contains cycles, **downgrade** to Naming‑only or reject the row.

**Outcome.** When CL≥3, you may **reuse row** for structural proofs; else teach differences.

---

## 13 · Relations (with other patterns)

* **Builds on:** E.10.D1 (D.CTX) **Context ≡ U.BoundedContext**; F.1 Contexts; F.2 Harvest; F.3 SenseCells.
* **Constrains:**

  * **F.4 Role Description:** **one SenseCell per Role Description**; no row anchoring.
  * **F.5 Naming:** Aliases are style‑only; no semantics movement.
  * **F.7 Concept‑Set:** rows must declare **Scope** & **Row CL(min)** and carry **loss notes**.
  * **F.9 Bridges:** any row proposal presupposes Bridges at or above τ(scope).
* **Used by.** All architheories (Part C) whenever new labels are contemplated.

---

## 14 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **Old “anchor” language.** Replace legacy “anchor” with: **SenseCell** (local sense) + **Role Description** (assignable contract) + (optionally) **Concept‑Set row** (Cross‑context reading).
2. **Over-strong rows.** If a row was used for **assignment/enactment-eligibility** or **Type-structure** but **CL drops**, **downgrade row scope** to **Naming-only** in prose; adjust examples.
3. **Split rows.** If one row covers cells whose Bridges diverge, **split** into two narrower rows with explicit loss notes.
4. **Alias proliferation.** Collapse redundant Aliases under a single F.5 entry; keep both registers (Tech/Plain).
5. **Proto‑types.** Suspect kernel inflation? Attempt **reduction**: SenseCell + row + existing U.Type. Only if irreducible across ≥ 3 families, reopen as a U.Type candidate.

---

## 15 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

### 15.1 Static conformance (SCR)

* **SCR‑F8‑S01 (senseFamily purity).** Every decision record names **one senseFamily**; mixed needs are split.
* **SCR‑F8‑S02 (Proper anchoring).** Every Role Description cites **one SenseCell**; **no row** is used as a assignment/enactment anchor.
* **SCR‑F8‑S03 (Row scope).** Whenever a row is reused, its **Scope** is stated and **Row CL(min) ≥ τ(scope)** holds.
* **SCR‑F8‑S04 (Alias modesty).** Aliases introduced in F.5 do **not** claim new semantics or change senseFamily.
* **SCR‑F8‑S05 (Kernel restraint).** Any new U.Type proposal includes **≥ 3 domain families** of evidence and an **irreducibility** note.

### 15.2 Regression (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F8‑E01 (CL drift).** If any Bridge’s CL changes, re‑evaluate dependent rows; **downgrade or split** where τ(scope) is no longer met.
* **RSCR-F8-E02 (Row overuse).** Scan examples: no case uses **Naming-only** rows to justify **Assignment-eligibility** or **Type-structure** claims.
* **RSCR‑F8‑E03 (Alias creep).** Ensure no Alias has accreted senseFamily‑specific semantics; if it has, migrate to a **row** or **Role Description**.
* **RSCR‑F8‑E04 (Kernel hygiene).** New U.Type proposals are rejected if a **SenseCell + row** construction suffices.

## 16 · Didactic distillation (90‑second teaching script)

> “When you feel like coining a new name, pause. **Which senseFamily** are you in—Role, Status, Measurement, Type‑structure, Method, or Execution? If a **single Context’s SenseCell** already says it, **reuse** that label. If you need an assignable contract, **mint a Role Description** anchored to that SenseCell. If you must read **across Contexts**, reuse a **Concept‑Set row**—but only **at a stated scope** and only if its **CL meets the threshold** (τ). If it’s just a nicer wording, add an **Alias** (style only). Only in the rare case of a cross‑family, **irreducible** notion do you **mint a new U.Type**. Never let Naming‑only rows justify  **Assignment-eligibility** or structural inference, and never let identical strings force equivalence. This is not process—it’s **discipline of thought**: reuse what exists, declare scope when you bridge, and mint new primitives only when the kernel truly needs them.”


# F.9 — Alignment & Bridge across Contexts \[A] 

**“Translate across Contexts; never collapse them.”**
**Status.** Architectural pattern \[A], architheory‑agnostic.
**Builds on:** E.10.D1 (Context discipline: Context ≡ U.BoundedContext); **F.0.1 (senseFamily & StatusModality guard; Bridge‑only crossing)**; F.1 (Contexts fixed); F.2/F.3 (Cells exist); F.7 (rows depend on Bridges); F.8 (thresholds τ).

**Coordinates with.** B.3 **Trust & Assurance Calculus** (uses CL penalties); Part C architheories (apply Bridges in formal claims).
**Aliases (informative).** *Context‑to‑Context translator*; *Sense bridge*.

---

## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **conceptual discipline** for relating **SenseCells** from **different Contexts (U.BoundedContext)**. A **Bridge** states *what kind* of relationship holds, *how far* it holds (via **CL: Congruence Level**), and *what is lost* during the translation. Bridges **permit carefully scoped reuse** (e.g., a Concept‑Set row) while **forbidding silent equivalence**.

**Applicability.** Use **whenever** an author needs to **read across Contexts**—to reuse a familiar label, to connect design‑time and run‑time notions, to compare two standards’ terms, or to justify a row in the Concept‑Set table. This pattern is **not** storage, workflow, or governance; it codifies **thinking moves**.

**Non‑goals.** No global meaning; no tool/API; no editor roles. Bridges are **semantic relations between local senses**, not pipelines, not processes.

---

## 2 · Problem frame

Cross‑context work fails in predictable ways:

1. **String‑equals fallacy.** Identical surfaces (“process”, “role”, “accuracy”) taken as identical meaning.
2. **Scope creep.** A naming convenience is stretched to assignment or structural claims.
3. **design/run stance jumping.** Design artefacts are substituted for run‑time occurrences (or vice‑versa).
4. **Direction amnesia.** Narrower/broader relations treated as symmetric.
5. **Loss blindness.** Differences (units, granularity, preconditions) are left unstated, contaminating downstream reasoning.

Bridges cure these by **making relation, direction, loss, and strength explicit**.

---

## 3 · Forces

| Force                           | Tension to resolve                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Locality vs reuse**           | Senses are context‑local, yet people need a common label to talk across Contexts.              |
| **Simplicity vs fidelity**      | Few Bridge kinds are teachable; too few will hide real mismatches.                       |
| **Safety vs utility**           | Allow some substitution when safe; forbid it when loss is unbounded.                     |
| **senseFamily purity vs explanation** | Substitution must preserve **senseFamily**; explanation may span **senseFamilies** without implying sameness. |

---

## 4 · Core idea (didactic)

**A Bridge is a declared translator between two local senses.**
It always names **(a)** the two **SenseCells**, **(b)** a **Bridge‑kind** (what relation), **(c)** a **direction** (if non‑symmetric), **(d)** a **CL** (how strong), and **(e)** **Loss Notes** (what fails to carry). Some Bridges **permit substitution** in limited scopes; others **permit only explanation**.

---

## 5 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Context** — shorthand for **U.BoundedContext** (per E.10.D1).
* **SenseCell** — the pair *(Context × Local‑Sense)* from F.3.
* **Bridge** — a conceptual relation between two SenseCells with kind, direction, CL, and loss notes.
* **CL (Congruence Level)** — ordinal strength (0…3) of a Bridge (see §7).
* **Scope** — the **licensed use** of a Cross‑context reading (as in F.7/F.8):

* **Naming‑only** (talk consistently),
* **Role Assignment & Enactment-eligibility** (assignable constraints/roles/status reuse),
* **Type‑structure** (safe structural inference).
* **senseFamily** — the semantic category (Role, Status, Measurement, Type‑structure, Method, Execution…) per F.0.1 (normative Part F guard).

---

## 6 · Bridge kinds (senseFamily‑aware)

> **Two families** of Bridges: **Substitution Bridges** (senseFamily‑preserving; can support Concept‑Set rows) and **Interpretation Bridges** (explanatory; **not** for substitution).

### 6.1 Substitution Bridges (sense‑preserving)

These relate **SenseCells of the same senseFamily** and may license **limited substitution**:

1. **Equivalence (≈)** — *near‑identity of sense*. Symmetric. Rare.
   *Use:* May support **Type‑structure** rows when CL=3 and invariants match.
   *Loss Notes:* usually “none” or “profiling differences”.

2. **Narrower‑than (⊑)** / **Broader‑than (⊒)** — *proper inclusion of sense*. Directional.
  *Use:* Safe to substitute **narrower → broader** in **Naming-only** and sometimes **Role Assignment & Enactment**; **broader → narrower** is unsafe.
   *Loss Notes:* “loses special cases X”.

3. **Partial‑overlap (⋂)** — *non‑empty intersection, neither includes the other*.
  *Use:* **Naming-only** at best. **Never** justifies Role Assignment & Enactment / Type-structure.
   *Loss Notes:* “A-only senseFamily”, “B-only senseFamily”.

4. **Disjoint (⊥)** — *explicit contrast*.
   *Use:* For **didactic warnings**; not a reuse license.
   *Loss Notes:* n/a (it asserts incompatibility).

### 6.2 Interpretation Bridges (cross‑senseFamily, explanatory)

These **do not allow substitution** but **explain connections** across senseFamilies:

5. **Design‑spec ↔ Run‑trace (⇄ᴅʀ)** — a design concept relates to its run‑time occurrence.
   *Example:* *BPMN\:Process* ⇄ᴅʀ *PROV\:Activity*.
   *Use:* Explain pipelines (design → execution → provenance). No Concept‑Set rows.
   *Loss Notes:* “graph vs event”, “control‑flow vs temporal extent”.

6. **Measure‑of / Evidence‑for (→ᴍᴇᵃ)** — a measurement SenseCell evidences or quantifies another **senseFamily** (e.g., a Requirement clause).
   *Example:* *SOSA\:Observation* →ᴍᴇᵃ *ITIL\:SLO fulfilment*.
   *Use:* Explain evaluation. No substitution.

7. **Policy‑implies / Obliges (→ᴅᵉᵒ)** — a deontic statement constrains another **senseFamily**.
   *Example:* *ODRL\:Duty* →ᴅᵉᵒ *Service behaviour*.
   *Use:* Explain constraint propagation.

> **Rule of thumb.** If you want **rows** or **substitution**, you need a **Substitution Bridge** on the **same senseFamily**. If you want to **explain** why artefacts relate without claiming sameness, use **Interpretation Bridges**.

---

## 7 · CL scale and scope thresholds

CL expresses how safely meaning carries over.

| CL    | Name              | Intuition                                            | Typical loss         | Row scope allowed (τ thresholds) |
| ----- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **0** | **Opposed**       | Intentionally contrastive or disjoint                | n/a                  | none                             |
| **1** | **Comparable**    | Talk under a shared label; senses differ materially  | material sense divergence | **Naming‑only** (τₙₐₘₑ=1)        |
| **2** | **Translatable**  | Bounded loss; consistent examples & counter-examples | small, stated losses | **Role Assignment & Enactment-eligibility** (τRAE=2)     |
| **3** | **Near‑identity** | Invariants match; no material counter‑example        | profile‑level only   | **Type‑structure** (τᵗʏᴘᴇ=3)     |

* **Thresholds (normative):**

  * Publishing a **Naming‑only** row requires **CL ≥ 1** across the row’s Cells.
 * Publishing a **Role Assignment & Enactment-eligible** row requires **CL ≥ 2** and **same senseFamily**, and **compatible stance**..
  * Publishing a **Type‑structure** row requires **CL = 3** **and** matched invariants (acyclicity, anti‑symmetry, units, etc.).

* **Penalty use (informative):** B.3 may convert **CL** into an assurance **penalty** when a Cross‑context claim is made.

---

## 8 · The Bridge Card (one‑screen sketch)

> A **thought‑format** (not a form). Every bullet can be said in a sentence.

* **Cells.** `σA@contextA` ↔ `σB@contextB`.
* **senseFamily.** *Role / Status / Measurement / Type‑structure / Method / Execution …*
* **Kind.** *≈ / ⊑ / ⊒ / ⋂ / ⊥ / ⇄ᴅʀ / →ᴍᴇᵃ / →ᴅᵉᵒ*.
* **Direction.** *A→B* (if non‑symmetric) or *A↔B*.
* **CL.** *0–3* with a short **why**.
* **Loss Notes (bullets).** What fails to carry (units, scope, granularity, preconditions, time stance).
* **Counter‑example.** The crispest case where substitution would mislead.
* **Allowed use.** *Naming-only / Role Assignment & Enactment-eligible / Type-structure / Explanation-only*.
* **Didactic hook.** The helpful sentence a careful engineer can remember.

*If your Bridge Card doesn’t fit on a screen, you’re describing the Contexts, not the Bridge.*

---

## 9 · Invariants (normative)

1. **Locality first.** A Bridge relates **SenseCells**, never Contexts or strings.
2. **senseFamily discipline.** **Substitution Bridges must be senseFamily‑preserving**. **Interpretation Bridges** may cross senseFamilies but **never** license substitution.
3. **Direction clarity.** If the kind is non‑symmetric (⊑/⊒), **state direction** explicitly.
4. **CL honesty.** Assign **CL** only if you can state at least one **counter‑example** (CL≤2) or explain its absence (CL=3).
5. **Loss visibility.** Every Bridge carries **Loss Notes** (even “none”).
6. **Row dependence.** A Concept‑Set row’s **scope** is **bounded by the weakest CL** among its participating Bridges (F.7/F.8).
7. **No senseFamily jump by stealth.** You **must not** use an Interpretation Bridge to justify a **row** or **substitution**.
8. **Time stance honesty.** If a Context fixes **design/run**, the Bridge must respect or explicitly declare stance relations (e.g., ⇄ᴅʀ).
9. **Kernel restraint.** Bridges **cannot** be used to promote ad‑hoc sameness into a new **U.Type**; A.11 applies.
10. **Non‑inheritance of Contexts.** Bridges **do not** imply “is‑a” between Contexts (E.10.D1).

---

## 10 · Micro‑examples (illustrative, one‑liners)

1. **Participant vs Agent (workflow vs provenance)**
   *Cells:* `BPMN:Participant` ↔ `PROV:Agent` • *senseFamily:* Role • *Kind:* ⋂ (overlap) • *CL:* 2 • *Loss:* participation vs attribution scopes differ • *Use:* **Naming‑only** (“actor”).

2. **Process (design) vs Activity (run)**
   *Cells:* `BPMN:Process` ⇄ᴅʀ `PROV:Activity` • *senseFamily:* Method ↔ Execution • *Kind:* **Design‑spec ↔ Run‑trace** • *CL:* 2 • *Loss:* graph vs event; concurrency vs temporalization • *Use:* **Explanation‑only**.

3. **Observation vs SLO check**
   *Cells:* `SOSA:Observation` →ᴍᴇᵃ `ITIL:SLO‑fulfilment` • *senseFamily:* Measurement → Status • *Kind:* Measure‑of • *CL:* 2 • *Loss:* sampling window; target definition • *Use:* **Explanation‑only**.

4. **Subtype across OWL and curated taxonomy**
   *Cells:* `OWL:SubClassOf` ≈ `TaxonomyX:is‑a` • *senseFamily:* Type‑structure • *Kind:* ≈ • *CL:* 3 *(only if TaxonomyX is acyclic & anti‑symmetric)* • *Loss:* profile differences • *Use:* **Type‑structure** rows allowed.

5. **Accuracy (metrology vs data‑quality)**
   *Cells:* `ISO80000:accuracy` ⋂ `ISO25024:accuracy` • *senseFamily:* Measurement • *Kind:* overlap • *CL:* 2 • *Loss:* instrument vs dataset perspective • *Use:* **Naming‑only** row “accuracy”; methods stay context‑local.

| **AP‑1**  | **String‑equals ≡ sense‑equals** | Same surface used across Contexts with silent identity claims.                       | Violates locality; invites false substitution.      | Always state a **Bridge kind**; if unsure, default to **⋂ overlap** with **Naming‑only** scope.             |

## 12 · Worked cross‑architheory examples (didactic)

### 12.1 Service acceptance (design) vs executions & observations (run)

* **Cells & Contexts**
  `ITIL4:SLO` *(Status, design)* ← **→ᴍᴇᵃ** — `SOSA:Observation(availability)` *(Measurement, run)*
  `BPMN:Process` *(Method, design)* ⇄ᴅʀ — `IEC61131:Task‑Execution` *(Execution, run)*
* **Narrative**
  Availability SLOs are **evaluated** by observations of task executions. No substitution: SLO ≠ observation; process ≠ execution.
* **Bridge Cards (sketch)**
  *ITIL\:SLO ←→ᴍᴇᵃ SOSA\:Observation* • **CL=2** • Loss: sampling window, clock skew.
  *BPMN\:Process ⇄ᴅʀ IEC\:Execution* • **CL=2** • Loss: control‑flow vs temporalization, concurrency collapse.
* **Permitted use**
  Explanation‑only; Concept‑Set rows may be **Naming‑only** (“availability”) with **CL≥1** label coherence across Contexts.

---

### 12.2 Behavioural role vs access role

* **Cells & Contexts**
  `BPMN:Participant` *(Role)* ⋂ `NIST‑RBAC:Role` *(Status)*
* **Narrative**
  Both talk about “who acts”, but one is **behavioural mask** in a workflow, the other **permission grouping**.
* **Bridge**
  **Kind:** overlap (⋂), **CL=2**; Loss: assignment moment, enforcement locus, multiplicity.
* **Permitted use**
* **Naming-only** row “actor”; **no Role Assignment & Enactment reuse** across senseFamilies.

---

### 12.3 Equivalence of subtype notions for structural rows

* **Cells & Contexts**
  `OWL2:SubClassOf` *(Type‑structure)* ≈ `TaxX:is‑a` *(Type‑structure curated)*
* **Bridge**
  **Kind:** ≈, **CL=3** **iff** curated taxonomy is **acyclic & anti‑symmetric** and uses class‑level reasoning.
* **Permitted use**
  **Type‑structure** rows allowed (τᵗʏᴘᴇ); Loss: OWL profile limitations (RL/EL/QO).

---

### 12.4 Accuracy (metrology) vs accuracy (data‑quality)

* **Cells & Contexts**
  `ISO80000:measurement‑accuracy` *(Measurement)* ⋂ `ISO25024:data‑accuracy` *(Measurement)*
* **Bridge**
  **Kind:** overlap, **CL=2**; Loss: “true value” notion differs (instrument vs dataset), scale transformations.
* **Permitted use**
  **Naming‑only** row “accuracy” used for reports; no shared methods.

---

### 12.5 Setpoint (control) vs target (service)

* **Cells & Contexts**
  `CTRL:text:setpoint` *(Status/Control)* ⊥ `ITIL:target` *(Status/Service)*
* **Bridge**
  **Kind:** disjoint (⊥) • Rationale: physical reference value vs business objective; different target kinds (control parameters vs requirement clause).
* **Permitted use**
  Didactic contrast only; prevents accidental substitution in SLO calculus.

## 13 · Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas)

> **All judgements are conceptual.** They license or forbid specific *thinking moves*—not API calls, not workflows.

### 13.1 Bridge declaration

`⊢ Bridge(σA@RA, σB@RB) : ⟨senseFamily, kind, dir, CL, Loss, scope⟩`

*Reading:* There exists a declared Bridge between SenseCells `σA` and `σB` with stated attributes.

---

### 13.2 Substitution licence (senseFamily‑preserving)

`Bridge(σA,σB): ⟨senseFamily f, kind∈{≈,⊑,⊒}, dir A→B, CL≥2, Loss L⟩ ⊢ A↠B @f (Role Assignment & Enactment-eligible)`

*Reading:* A **Substitution Bridge** on the same senseFamily with **CL≥2** licenses **Role-Assignment/Enactment-level** substitution **in the stated direction**. (Type-structure requires **CL=3**.)

---

### 13.3 Naming‑only licence

`Bridge(σA,σB): ⟨kind∈{≈,⊑,⊒,⋂}, CL≥1⟩ ⊢ A⇝B (Naming‑only)`

*Reading:* A Bridge with **CL≥1** supports using a shared label in prose or Concept-Set **Naming-only** rows, without structural or Role Assignment & Enactment commitments.

---

### 13.4 Prohibition by kind

`Bridge(σA,σB): ⟨kind=⊥⟩ ⊢ ¬(A↠B) ∧ ¬(row(A,B))`

*Reading:* **Disjoint** forbids substitution and rows; only contrastive teaching is allowed.

---

### 13.5 Interpretation embargo

`Bridge(σA,σB): ⟨kind∈{⇄ᴅʀ,→ᴍᴇᵃ,→ᴅᵉᵒ}⟩ ⊢ Explanation‑only`

*Reading:* **Interpretation Bridges** never license substitution or rows.

---

### 13.6 Weakest‑link rule for rows

`row R uses {Bridge_i} ⊢ scope(R) = min_i(scopeAllowed(Bridge_i)) ∧ CL(R)=min_i(CL_i)`

*Reading:* The **row scope** and **row CL** are bounded by the weakest participating Bridge.

---

### 13.7 Direction guard

`Bridge kind=⊑ with dir A→B ⊢ ¬(B↠A)`

*Reading:* Narrower→Broader does **not** invert; only A may substitute into B under the stated scope.

---

### 13.8 SenseFamily purity

`Bridge scope=Role Assignment & Enactment-eligible ⊢ senseFamily(A)=senseFamily(B) ∧ stance(A)=stance(B)`

*Reading:* Role Assignment & Enactment-level substitution requires **same senseFamily** and same stance (run-time or design time).

---

### 13.9 Loss accumulation

`A↠B with Loss L₁ ∧ B↠C with Loss L₂ ⊢ A↠C allowed only if same senseFamily ∧ CL=min(CL₁,CL₂) ∧ Loss ⊇ (L₁∪L₂)`

*Reading:* Chained substitution is rarer; if used, **accumulate Loss** and respect the **minimum CL**. When in doubt, avoid chaining across Contexts.

---

## 14 · Relations

**Builds on:** E.10.D1 (Context discipline: Context ≡ U.BoundedContext); **F.0.1 (senseFamily guard; Bridge‑only crossing)**; F.1 (Contexts fixed); F.2/F.3 (Cells exist); F.7 (rows depend on Bridges); F.8 (thresholds τ).

**Constrains:**

* **F.7 Concept‑Set Table:** each Cross‑context row must name supporting **Bridges**; row scope ≤ weakest Bridge.
* **F.8 Mint or Reuse?:** reuse choices reference **CL** and **kind**; no reuse without a Bridge.
* **Part C architheories:** formal claims that span Contexts cite Bridges and respect senseFamily/StatusModality & CL constraints.
* **B.3 Trust & Assurance Calculus:** may interpret **CL** as a penalty factor in Cross‑context reasoning.

---

## 15 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **Edition shift in a Context.** Re‑read affected **Cells**; if sense moved, split the Bridge or **lower CL**; keep the older Bridge for historical claims.
2. **New evidence of mismatch.** Add a **counter‑example**; **decrease CL** or change **kind** (e.g., from ≈ to ⊑ or ⋂).
3. **Convergence over time.** When invariants demonstrably match, and counter‑examples evaporate, **raise CL** cautiously; for **CL=3**, cite invariants.
4. **senseFamily refactor.** If a Cell’s senseFamily was mis‑typed, fix the senseFamily first in F.3, then revisit Bridges; **Interpretation** is safer than forced substitution.
5. **Row under‑protected.** If a row’s scope exceeds the weakest Bridge, either **split the row** by Context or **downgrade scope** to Naming‑only.
6. **Bridge sprawl.** Consolidate near‑duplicates into one Bridge with richer **Loss Notes**; retire the rest.

---

## 16 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

### 16.1 Static conformance (SCR)

* **SCR‑F9‑S01 (Well‑typed).** Every Bridge names **two SenseCells**, each bound to a **Context** from F.1, and states **senseFamily**, **kind**, **dir** (if needed), **CL**, **Loss**, **scope**.
* **SCR‑F9‑S02 (senseFamily discipline).** Any Bridge that licenses **Role/Enactment-eligible** substitution is **senseFamily‑preserving** and **kind ∈ {≈,⊑,⊒}**.
* **SCR‑F9‑S03 (Loss visibility).** Every Bridge has **non‑empty Loss Notes** (the word “none” is allowed only with **CL=3** and stated invariants).
* **SCR‑F9‑S04 (Counter‑example hygiene).** Bridges with **CL≤2** carry at least one **counter‑example**; Bridges with **CL=3** cite **matching invariants**.
* **SCR‑F9‑S05 (Row compliance).** Every Concept‑Set row shows a **scope** no greater than the **minimum CL** across its supporting Bridges; no row relies on **Interpretation** Bridges.

### 16.2 Regression (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F9‑E01 (Edition churn).** When a Context’s edition changes, re‑validate all Bridges touching it; **flag CL drift** and update rows’ scopes if needed.
* **RSCR‑F9‑E02 (Counter‑example drift).** New counter‑examples lower **CL**; deletions do not automatically raise **CL**.
* **RSCR‑F9‑E03 (senseFamily drift).** If a Cell’s senseFamily is corrected, all Bridges crossing that Cell are re‑typed; any substitution that would now cross senseFamilies is **invalidated**.
* **RSCR‑F9‑E04 (Weakest‑link enforcement).** Adding a low‑CL Bridge to a row **reduces** the row’s scope; if the row’s published scope would exceed the new minimum, **split** or **downgrade** the row.

---

## 17 · Didactic distillation (90‑second script)

> “A **Bridge** translates between **local senses** from different **Contexts**. It always declares **what relation** (≈, ⊑, ⋂, ⊥, or an **interpretation** like design↔run), **how strong** (CL 0–3), **which way** (for ⊑/⊒), and **what is lost**. **Substitution** is allowed only on the **same senseFamily** and only with **CL≥2**; **Type‑structure** needs **CL=3**. **Interpretation Bridges** explain, never substitute. Rows in the Concept‑Set table obey the **weakest‑link**: their scope cannot exceed the lowest CL among their Bridges. When editions change or counter‑examples surface, **lower CL** or change **kind**; if two senses truly converge and invariants match, raise to **CL=3**—rarely, and with reasons. Translate across Contexts; never collapse them.”

# F.10 — Status Families Mapping (Evidence • Standard • Requirement) \[A] 

**“Keep statuses in their native modality; translate between Contexts explicitly.”**
**Status.** Architectural pattern \[A], architheory‑agnostic.
**Builds on:** E.10.D1 **D.CTX** (Context ≡ `U.BoundedContext`); F.1 (Contexts), F.2 (Seeds), F.3 (Local‑Senses → SenseCells), F.4 (Role Description **Status** templates), F.9 (Bridges).
**Coordinates with.** B.3 **Trust & Assurance Calculus** (interprets CL penalties); Part C architheories: **KD‑CAL** (measurement semantics), **Norm‑CAL** (deontic logic), **Method‑CAL** (design/run stance).

---

## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **simple, Context‑first way** to express and compare **status meanings** across disciplines **without collapsing modalities** (*epistemic* vs *deontic*). We focus on three pervasive **status families**:

1. **EvidenceStatus** (what the world **shows**) — epistemic modality.
2. **StandardStatus** (what a canon **sanctions**) — deontic (curatorial) modality.
3. **RequirementStatus** (what an obligation is **doing**) — deontic (compliance) modality.

Each status meaning is **local to a Context** (`U.BoundedContext`). Cross‑context relationships appear **only** via **Bridges** (F.9) with a declared **kind** and **CL** (congruence level).

**Applicability.** Whenever models mix observations, standards, and obligations: service acceptance from uptime measurements; safety proofs against normative checklists; ML model “validated” vs “approved for use”.

**Non‑goals.** No workflows, no tool states, no editorial lifecycles. This pattern defines **conceptual meaning and safe reasoning moves**, not procedures.

---

## 2 · Problem frame

Without a modality‑aware mapping of statuses:

* **Homonym traps.** *Validated* in metrology ≠ *validated* in software QA; *approved* in a standard ≠ *compliant* to a requirement.
* **Design/run bleed.** Design‑time “approved method” is used as if it proved run‑time “meets SLO”.
* **False substitution.** *Observed availability 99.95%* is silently treated as *SLO satisfied* without declaring the translation.
* **Name inflation.** New U.Types minted to stabilise drifting status words instead of fixing Contexts and Bridges.

---

## 3 · Forces

| Force                                     | Tension to resolve                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local fidelity vs Cross‑context reuse**    | Keep native Context meanings, yet enable explanation and (sometimes) substitution.                |
| **Didactic simplicity vs status variety** | Many status schemes exist; we need a **small spine** that admits Context synonyms.                |
| **Design vs run**                         | Standards speak design; evidence speaks run; requirements span both; do not swap them.         |
| **Safety vs utility**                     | Substitution is powerful but risky; explanation is safer but weaker. Make the choice explicit. |

---

## 4 · Core idea (didactic)

**Three families, two modalities, one habit.**
Treat every status word as a **SenseCell with a declared StatusModality** and **inside one Context**. When you must relate statuses across Contexts, **declare a Bridge** (F.9) that says *what kind of relation*, *how strong (CL)*, *which way (if narrower/broader)*, and *what is lost*. Prefer **explanation** Bridges; permit **substitution** only when kind/CL allow it.

**Reading an Episteme.** For every `U.Episteme`, read _Object_ (what it is about), _Concept_ (model/postulates), _Symbol_ (carriers). **Statuses classify the Episteme;** enactment remains with `U.System` and `U.Work`. (Formal identity rules: see **KD‑CAL**.)

## 5 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **StatusFamily.** Sub‑typing inside **senseFamily=Status**: one of **EvidenceStatus**, **StandardStatus**, **RequirementStatus**.
* **StatusCell.** A **SenseCell** whose meaning is a status with a declared **StatusModality ∈ {epistemic, deontic}**
* **StatusModality.** The mode of a StatusCell: **epistemic** or **deontic**. Use this term instead of the bare word *modality* per E.10 LEX rules.
* **Polarity.** The orientation of a status relative to a claim/obligation: **Positive** (supports/satisfies), **Negative** (contradicts/violates), **Neutral/Undetermined**.
* **Window.** The **applicability span** of a status (temporal or conditional), e.g., “Q3‑2025”, “under load ≥ 70%”.
* **Target.** What the status is **about**: a **claim** (epistemic), an **artefact or method** (standard), a **clause** (requirement).
* **Bridge (F.9).** The only legal way to relate StatusCells across Contexts; declares **kind** (≈, ⊑, ⊒, ⋂, ⊥, or an Interpretation arrow), **CL**, and **Loss**; **substitution is modality‑preserving**.

> **StatusModality guard.** EvidenceStatus is **epistemic**; StandardStatus & RequirementStatus are **deontic**. **Role Description Status** templates (F.4) bind to these **StatusModalities**; **no mixing**. The bare token *modality* is against E.10/LEX); this pattern uses **StatusModality**.

---

## 6 · The spine: three local ladders (Context‑native, small and renameable)

> The following ladders are **didactic spines**. Each Context may rename levels or insert thin sub‑levels, but Bridges must state how they align to this spine (kind & CL). Names appear in **Tech** / **Plain** register.

 -   **Episteme‑as‑actor (forbidden).** Never attribute **Work** to an Episteme; only Systems act.
    
-   **Requirement vs Hypothesis.** “Desired property/goal” is **not** `Requirement` status; use hypothesis/target + evaluation.
    
-   **Mereology ≠ Provenance.** Part‑whole edges never justify claims; use EPV‑DAG with carriers.


### 6.1 EvidenceStatus (epistemic statusModality)

**Levels (from weaker to stronger):**

1. **Observed** / *Seen once.*
2. **Measured** / *Quantified under a declared procedure.*
3. **Corroborated** / *Seen independently (≥ 2 distinct sources/procedures).*
4. **Replicated** / *Repeated by others under varied conditions.*
5. **Refuted** *(negative polarity)* / *Counter‑evidence overrides prior levels.*
6. **Inconclusive** *(neutral)* / *Insufficient signal.*

**Context alignment examples (illustrative):**
`SOSA/SSN:Observation` ↦ **Observed/Measured**; `GxP validation datapack` may map to **Replicated** (if protocol diversity holds) with **CL stated**.

**Invariants (context‑local):**
*Replicated ⇒ Corroborated ⇒ Measured ⇒ Observed.* Negative (**Refuted**) cancels positives **within the same Window**.

---

### 6.2 StandardStatus (deontic/curatorial statusModality)

**Levels (design‑time stance):**

1. **Candidate** / *Proposed, under review.*
2. **Draft** / *Working text, not normative.*
3. **Approved** / *Normative in this Context/edition.*
4. **Deprecated** *(negative)* / *Discouraged; may be removed.*
5. **Superseded** *(negative)* / *Replaced by a newer edition/profile.*

**Context alignment examples:**
`ISO profile: Published International Standard` ↦ **Approved**; `IETF RFC (Proposed Standard)` ↦ **Draft/Approved** depending on local policy; **CL must be declared** on the Bridge.

**Invariants:**
At most one positive stance at a time **per Context & edition**; **Superseded** implies **Approved** held in a prior Window.

---

### 6.3 RequirementStatus (deontic/compliance statusModality)

**Levels (run‑aware stance toward an obligation):**

1. **Applicable** / *The clause binds in this Window.*
2. **Inapplicable** / *Clause does not bind under stated conditions.*
3. **Satisfied** *(positive)* / *Met within Window.*
4. **Violated** *(negative)* / *Not met within Window.*
5. **Waived** *(neutral/administrative)* / *Binding suspended with justification.*
6. **Pending** *(neutral)* / *Awaiting evaluation or evidence.*

**Context alignment examples:**
`ITIL4:SLO achieved` ↦ **Satisfied**; `ODRL:Duty fulfilled` ↦ **Satisfied**; `ODRL:Prohibition breached` ↦ **Violated**.

**Invariants:**
For the **same clause and Window**, **Satisfied** and **Violated** are **mutually exclusive**. **Applicable** is a **precondition** for either; **Waived** switches off the precondition temporarily.

### 6.4 Contextual Citation Operators (pointer)

**Citation operators (context‑scoped).** Authors MAY use the **typed edges** `supports`, `refutes`, `dependsOn`, `supersedes` **inside a single Context** when expressing how an `Evidence`/`Standard` status applies. **Formal semantics live in B.3.2 (Evidence & Validation Logic).** Cross‑Context use requires a declared **Bridge** (F.9) and carries CL/Loss penalties.


## 7 · Solution — how meanings connect (conceptual, notation‑free)

**S‑1. Anchor status meanings per Context.**
Every status word (*validated*, *approved*, *compliant*) is treated as a **StatusCell** inside a specific Context. The **ladder position** is determined **locally** (e.g., “validated (metrology)” aligns to **Replicated** with CL stated; “validated (software)” may align to **Corroborated**).

**S‑2. Attach statuses to the right Targets.**
*EvidenceStatus → Claim or Quantity; StandardStatus → Method/Artefact; RequirementStatus → Clause.*
This prevents swapping “how we measure” with “what we promise”.

**S‑3. Translate via Bridges, not by name.**
Example: **Measured availability (SOSA)** →ᴍᴇᵃ **SLO clause (ITIL)** with **CL=2**, Loss: sampling window & clock skew. This supports **explanation**; **substitution** (“Satisfied”) requires **same StatusModality**, a stricter Bridge kind (F.9) **and** a declared evaluation rule (from the Service pattern), not from F.10.

**S‑4. Keep design/run honest.**
**StandardStatus** is design‑stance; **EvidenceStatus** is run‑signal; **RequirementStatus** spans both. Use **Interpretation Bridges** (F.9) for design↔run readings, not equivalence.

**S‑5. Prefer explanation over substitution.**
If a Bridge cannot reach **CL≥2** on the **same senseFamily**, do **not** substitute. Use **Naming‑only** rows or **explanations**; keep Role Descriptions (F.4) out of harm’s way.

---

## 8 · Invariants (normative, lightweight)

1. **Modality purity.** A StatusCell’s **StatusModality** is explicit and **must not change** during reasoning; cross‑modality claims require an **Interpretation Bridge** (F.9).
2. **Target typing.** A status **must name its Target kind** (claim / artefact / clause). Inferences that ignore the Target kind are invalid.
3. **Window discipline.** Every positive/negative status **names a Window**; contradictions are detected **within the same Window** only.
4. **Local monotonicity.** Within one context, **stronger** EvidenceStatus implies all **weaker** positives for the same Target & Window.
5. **Mutual exclusivity (requirement).** For a given clause & Window: **not** (Satisfied ∧ Violated).
6. **No free promotion.** **StandardStatus** (Approved) **does not** entail **RequirementStatus** (Applicable or Satisfied).
7. **Bridge gate.** Any Cross‑context comparison or reuse of a status **must cite a Bridge** (kind, CL, Loss); otherwise only **context‑local** reading is permitted.
8. **Weakest‑link propagation.** When multiple Bridges contribute to a Cross‑context interpretation, the **effective CL** is the **minimum** (cf. F.7/F.9).
9. **Naming restraint.** Status labels used across Contexts **without** a Bridge are **Naming-only** and **non-operative** for Role Assignment & Enactment decisions.

## 9 · Micro‑illustrations (snapshots, not procedures)

* **Metrology → Service.**
  *Observed uptime (SOSA)* with Window “July” plus Bridge **→ᴍᴇᵃ** to *SLO clause (ITIL)* yields: **we can explain** why “Satisfied” might hold **if** the Service pattern’s evaluation rule says so. F.10 itself **does not** declare “Satisfied”.

* **QA vs GxP “validation”.**
  *Validated (software QA Context)* aligns to **Corroborated** (CL=1–2).
  *Validated (GxP Context)* aligns to **Replicated** (CL=2–3) with Loss: environment diversity.
  Equating them needs **≈** with **CL stated** or they remain separate.

* **“Approved model” ≠ “Compliant outcome”.**
  **StandardStatus: Approved** for a **MethodDescription** does **not** imply **RequirementStatus: Satisfied** for a production clause. It only permits use; evidence must still speak.

## 11 · Worked examples (multi‑architheory)

> Each example names **Contexts**, shows **StatusCells** on their native ladders, and draws **only the Bridges that F.10 allows**.

### 11.1 Service acceptance from run‑time evidence

**Contexts.** *SOSA/SSN (2017)* — sensing; *ITIL 4 (2020)* — services; *ODRL 2.2* — deontics (optional).

**Local statuses.**

* `SOSA:Observation(uptime)` → **EvidenceStatus: Measured**, Window **July**.
* `ITIL:SLO("99.9% monthly")` → **RequirementStatus** Target = clause *SLO‑99.9*, Window **July**.
* `ITIL:Practice("Monitoring pipeline")` → **StandardStatus: Approved** (design‑time).

**Bridges.**

* **Interpretation**: `Measured(uptime@July)` **→ᴍᴇᵃ** `SLO‑99.9` (kind = ⊑, CL = 2, Loss: sampling bias, clock skew).
* **Evaluation rule** (Service pattern, local to ITIL Context): returns **Satisfied** iff *mean uptime ≥ threshold* across Window.

**Result.** We may **explain** the **Satisfied** conclusion for *SLO‑99.9\@July*; we **do not** assert StandardStatus⇒RequirementStatus. If logs later show outages, a **Violated\@July** replaces **Satisfied\@July** (mutual exclusivity + Window discipline).

---

### 11.2 Safety controller: design approval vs run‑time duty

**Contexts.** *State‑space control texts* — design; *IEC 61131‑3* — run; *Norm‑CAL profile (safety layer)* — deontics.

**Local statuses.**

* `ControllerSpec(v3)` — **StandardStatus: Approved** in the **Norm‑CAL** Context.
* `PLC:Task(log@Q3)` — **EvidenceStatus: Corroborated** for *response time ≤ 50 ms*, Window **Q3**.
* `Duty("Emergency stop ≤ 100 ms")` — **RequirementStatus** clause in Norm‑CAL.

**Bridges.**

* **Interpretation**: `Corroborated(response@Q3)` **→** `Duty` check (kind = ⊑, CL = 2, Loss: sensor latency).

**Result.** The **duty** may be **Satisfied\@Q3** with explanation. *Approved spec* **alone** never yields *Satisfied*; it authorises deployment but does not prove compliance.

---

### 11.3 ML model: validation vs fairness requirement

**Contexts.** *ML validation canon* — design/run hybrid; *Policy Context (fairness charter)* — deontics; *SOSA/metrics* — sensing.

**Local statuses.**

* `Model v12: cross‑val AUC=0.92` → **EvidenceStatus: Corroborated** (Windows: CV folds).
* `Policy: “Demographic parity Δ ≤ 0.1”` → **RequirementStatus** clause.
* `“Validation SOP v5”` → **StandardStatus: Approved** (governance method).

**Bridges.**

* `Measured(Δ@Aug)` **→ᴍᴇᵃ** `Policy clause` (⊑, CL = 2, Loss: sampling variance).

**Result.** **Satisfied\@Aug** (if Δ≤ 0.1 in production Window) is justifiable. Cross‑val AUC does **not** decide fairness; only **production Δ** does.

---

### 11.4 Medical device log: refutation

**Contexts.** *SOSA/clinical observations*; *Regulatory profile*.

**Local statuses.**

* `Observation: adverse event` → **EvidenceStatus: Observed\@Week 34**.
* `Requirement: “No AE in first 30 days”` → **RequirementStatus** clause.

**Bridge & outcome.**

* Observation **→ Interpretation Bridge** to clause check (**kind: Interpretation**, **CL=3**).
* **Violated\@Week 34** overrides any earlier **Satisfied\@Week 34** (Weakest‑link; same Window).

## 12 · Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas, notation‑free)

> **Premises ⊢ conclusion.** No side effects. All moves are **mental** and **Context‑aware**.

1. **StatusModality classification**
   `σ is a StatusCell ⊢ statusModality(σ) ∈ {epistemic, deontic}`
   *Reading:* Every status sits on exactly one statusModality.

2. **Target typing**
   `σ ⊢ targetKind(σ) ∈ {claim, artefact/method, clause}`
   *Reading:* Evidence→claim; Standard→artefact/method; Requirement→clause.

3. **Window requirement**
   `σ has polarity ∈ {positive, negative} ⊢ window(σ) ≠ ∅`
   *Reading:* Pos/neg statuses must name a Window.

4. **Local ladder monotonicity (evidence)**
   `Replicated(τ,W) ⊢ Corroborated(τ,W) ⊢ Measured(τ,W) ⊢ Observed(τ,W)`
   *Reading:* Stronger implies weaker within the same Window.

5. **Requirement exclusivity**
   `clause κ, window W ⊢ ¬(Satisfied(κ,W) ∧ Violated(κ,W))`
   *Reading:* A clause cannot be both satisfied and violated in one Window.

6. **Windowed refutation**
   `Refuted(τ,W) ⊢ cancels {Observed,Measured,Corroborated,Replicated}(τ,W)`
   *Reading:* Negative evidence cancels positives only in the same Window.

7. **Explanation Bridge**
   `σ@C, τ@D, Bridge(C,D, kind∈{≈,⊑,⊒,⋂}, CL, Loss), sameStatusModality ⊢ explains(σ ⇒ τ) with ⟨CL,Loss⟩`
   *Reading:* Cross‑context explanation is permitted when statusModalities match.

8. **Substitution permission (guarded)**
   `explains(σ ⇒ τ) ∧ kind∈{≈,⊑,⊒} ∧ CL≥θ ∧ windowsAligned ⊢ maySubstitute(σ→τ)`
   *Reading:* Substitution is allowed only above a **project‑declared threshold θ** (see F.7) and aligned Windows.

9. **Cross‑statusModality embargo**
   `statusModality(σ) ≠ statusModality(τ) ⊢ explains(σ ⇒ τ) requires Interpretation kind`
   *Reading:* Crossing statusModalities is **interpretation** only; no direct substitution.

10. **Observation→Requirement clause (SOSA, Work outcomes)**
   `SOSA:Observation about Work outcomes ⊢ may interpret(RequirementClause κ) via Bridge(kind=Interpretation, CL, Loss); produces Evaluation(κ, Window); substitution forbidden`
   *Reading:* Observations inform clause evaluation within a Window; they never become RequirementStatus. Use F.12 for the verdict pipeline.

11. **Weakest‑link CL**
   `{explains(σᵢ ⇒ τ) with CLᵢ} ⊢ effectiveCL(⋀ᵢ σᵢ ⇒ τ) = minᵢ(CLᵢ)`
   *Reading:* Multiple Bridges compose by the minimum CL.

12. **Naming‑only safeguard**
   `noBridge(C,D) ⊢ crossContextUse(σ@C ⇒ τ@D) = namingOnly`
   *Reading:* Without a Bridge, only **explanatory prose** is allowed—no status inferences.

13. **Design/run stance honesty**
   `statusModality=deontic ∧ targetKind=artefact/method ∧ window=W ⊢ doesNotDecide(clause κ @ W)`
   *Reading:* Approval of a method never decides a clause’s satisfaction for a run‑time Window.

## 13 · Relations

**Builds on:**
E.10.D1 **D.CTX** (Context discipline); F.1 (Contexts in view); F.2–F.3 (Seeds→Local‑Senses→SenseCells); F.4 (Role Description **Status** template with statusModality/target/window slots); F.7 (Bridge taxonomy & CL semantics); F.9 (Bridge artefact).

**Constrains:**

* **F.4 (Role Description Status):** a Role Description Status **must** select a **StatusFamily**, **StatusModality**, **target kind**, and **Window**.
* **F.8 (Naming):** status labels reused across Contexts **must** be marked as **Context‑scoped**; global synonyms forbidden.
* **Part C architheories:** KD‑CAL provides measurement semantics for EvidenceStatus; Norm‑CAL provides clause logic for RequirementStatus; Method‑CAL frames design/run stance for StandardStatus.

**Used by.**
Service Acceptance (F.12), Assurance roll‑ups (B.3), any cross‑domain conformance narrative.

## 14 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **New status word appears.** Treat it as a **StatusCell** in its Context; place it on the local ladder; only then consider Bridges.
2. **Edition changes.** If a Context redefines a status, **fork the StatusCell** (new SenseCell) and relate old↔new via a **Bridge** (often ⊑/⊒ with Loss).
3. **Threshold tuning.** The project sets **θ** (minimum CL for substitution). Lowering θ widens reuse but increases risk; document the choice in F.7 terms.
4. **Clause redesign.** If a requirement clause changes, keep old **Windows** intact; new clause starts a new Target; do **not** rewrite history.
5. **Explode→compress.** When many bespoke tool statuses pile up, **map** them to the nearest ladder level in their Contexts; keep tool labels as **Naming‑only**.
6. **Bridge hardening.** If explanation Bridges are used frequently, reconsider experiments that could raise **CL** enough to permit substitution—or accept explanation as sufficient and stop short of substitution.

---

## 15 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

### 15.1 Static conformance (SCR)

* **SCR‑F10‑S01 (Modality & Target).** Every StatusCell declares **StatusModality** and **target kind**; none cross modalities.
* **SCR‑F10‑S02 (Windowed polarity).** Every positive/negative StatusCell instance bears a **Window**.
* **SCR‑F10‑S03 (Local order).** EvidenceStatus instances satisfy **monotonicity**; RequirementStatus enforces **mutual exclusivity** per clause+Window.
* **SCR‑F10‑S04 (Bridge citation).** Any Cross‑context comparison cites a **Bridge(kind, CL, Loss)**; absent that, mark as **naming‑only**.
* **SCR‑F10‑S05 (Substitution guard).** Any substitution claim checks **same StatusModality**, **kind ∈ {≈,⊑,⊒}**, **CL≥θ**, **Windows aligned**.
* **SCR‑F10‑S06 (Weakest‑link).** Where multiple Bridges feed one conclusion, the displayed **effective CL** is the **minimum**.

### 15.2 Regression (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F10‑E01 (Edition churn).** Adding a new edition of a Context **does not** retro‑change past status conclusions; only new Windows see new meanings.
* **RSCR‑F10‑E02 (Threshold change).** If θ changes, re‑evaluate only **substitution** conclusions; **explanations** remain valid.
* **RSCR‑F10‑E03 (Bridge drift).** When a Bridge’s CL/Loss changes, recompute affected **effective CL**; substitution conclusions below θ revert to **explanation**.
* **RSCR‑F10‑E04 (Contradiction catch).** Adding a negative status within a Window **cancels** prior positives for the same clause (or raises a flagged contradiction if both persist).

## 16 · Didactic distillation (90‑second script)

> **Three families, two modalities.** *Evidence* tells us what the world **shows** (Observed→Measured→Corroborated→Replicated; Refuted cancels) — **epistemic**; *Standard* tells us what a canon **sanctions** (Candidate→Draft→Approved→Deprecated→Superseded) — **deontic**; *Requirement* tells us what an obligation is **doing** (Applicable/Inapplicable; Satisfied/Violated; Waived/Pending) — **deontic**.
> Every status is a **StatusCell inside one Context** with exactly one **StatusModality**, a **Target**, and a **Window**.
> When you must relate status meanings across Contexts, **draw a Bridge** that states the **kind** (≈, ⊑/⊒, ⋂, ⊥ or Interpretation), the **CL** (strength), and the **Loss** (what you ignore). Prefer **explanation**; allow **substitution** only when statusModalities match, kind permits, **CL≥θ**, and Windows align.
> Keep **design vs run** stance honest: approval is **design‑time**, evidence is **run‑time**, requirements **span both**. With this habit, “validated”, “approved” and “compliant” stop being a muddle of synonyms and become **precise, local meanings** you can compare **safely** and **audibly**.


# F.11 — Method Quartet Harmonisation \[A] 

**“Keep the *how* (Method), the *recipe* (MethodDescription), the *happening* (Work/Execution), and the *control push* (Actuation) in their own Contexts—then relate them explicitly.”**

**Status.** Architectural pattern \[A], architheory‑agnostic.
**Builds on:** E.10.D1 **D.CTX** (Context discipline); A.3/**A.3.1**/**A.3.2** (Transformer Constitution; `U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription`); A.15/**A.15.1** (`U.Work` as record of occurrence); Sys‑CAL (control/actuation semantics); KD‑CAL (observation).
**Coordinates with.** F.1–F.3 (Contexts, Seeds → SenseCells), F.4 (Role Description), F.5 (Naming), F.6 (Role Assignment & Enactment Cycle (Six-Step)), F.7/F.9 (Bridges), F.10 (Status families & Windows).
**Aliases (informative).** *Method/Spec/Work/Actuation split*; *design/run harmonisation*.

---

## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **notation‑free, Context‑aware map** that keeps four notions distinct and connectable:

* **`U.Method`** — the abstract **way of doing** (design‑time concept).
* **`U.MethodDescription`** — the **recipe** that describes a Method (epistemic artefact).
* **`U.Work`** (informal: *Execution*) — the **run‑time occurrence** of doing (recorded event).
* **`U.Actuation`** — the **control output** applied to a plant (domain‑specific Work in Sys‑CAL).

The pattern makes the split **usable across architheories** (Role Assignment & Enactment, Sys-CAL, KD-CAL, Kind-CAL, planned LCA-CAL) and **legible across Contexts** (SPEM/BPMN for design; PROV-O/SOSA for run; IEC 61131-3/state-space for control).

**Applicability.** Any time a discussion risks **mixing designs with executions**, **recipes with runs**, or **workflow with control signals**; whenever you need to **name** or **reason** about “how we do X”, “the SOP/script/model”, “the actual run”, or “the actuator push”.

**Non‑goals.** No team workflow, no editors, no tools. No prescriptive file formats. **Only** conceptual distinctions and safe reasoning moves.

---

## 2 · Problem frame

When Method, MethodDescription, Work, and Actuation **collapse into one another**, models drift:

1. **Design/run blur.** A BPMN *process* (design graph) is cited as if it had *happened*.
2. **Recipe/approval fallacy.** An *approved* SOP (MethodDescription) is treated as proof that the service met its SLO.
3. **Execution ≟ control.** PLC *task execution* logs are conflated with *control outputs* (actuation), hiding stability issues.
4. **Cross‑context homonymy.** *Activity, task, execution, process, command* change sense across Contexts; inferences quietly break.

| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fidelity vs didactics**    | We must honour domain nuance yet teach a split that fits in working memory.                                    |
| **Universality vs locality** | Quartet must be reusable across architheories, while meanings stay **context‑local**.                             |
| **Evidence vs approval**     | Evidence (run‑time) should support decisions, but must **not** be mistaken for deontic approval (design‑time). |
| **Action vs signal**         | Executing a method is not the same as emitting a control signal; both can co‑occur in one scenario.            |

## 4 · Core idea (didactic)

**Four boxes, four arrows, zero leakage.**

* **Box 1 — Method (design).** The **idea** of how to achieve an effect (algorithm, clinical pathway, welding technique).
* **Box 2 — MethodDescription (design, epistemic).** The **written/encoded recipe** that *describes* a Method (SOP, code, BPMN/SPEM model, theorem‑prover script).
* **Box 3 — Work (run).** The **occurrence** where a System‑in‑Role enacts (some version of) the Method. *`U.Work` is the record of this event.*
* **Box 4 — Actuation (run, Sys‑CAL).** The **control output** (setpoint/command) issued to influence a plant during Work.

**Arrows (conceptual relations).**

* `MethodDescription ↦ Method` (**describes**) — design stance.
* `Work ↦ MethodDescription` (**followedRecipe?** yes/no/variant) — run stance referencing design.
* `Work ↦ Method` (**enacts**) — run stance referencing the abstract way.
* `Actuation ↦ Work` (**part‑of / occurs‑during**) — control output inside execution.

Each box/arrow is **context‑local** (SPEM, PROV‑O, IEC…). **Cross‑context relations use Bridges** (F.7/F.9) with CL/Loss.

---

## 5 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Context** = `U.BoundedContext` (per D.CTX).
* **Local‑Sense** → **SenseCell** (F.3): the address *(Context × sense)* for a term like *process*, *task*, *activity*, *command*.
* **Concept‑Set** (F.7/F.8): row aligning multiple SenseCells as “what we regard as the same” (after Bridges & losses are declared).
* **Window** (F.10): temporal/conditional envelope (e.g., *July*, *during test run T42*, *under load ≥ 70%*).
* **StatusCell** (F.10): laddered status **about** methods/specs/works (e.g., *Approved (spec)*; *Observed/Measured (work)*).

## 6 · Solution — the quartet lens (notation‑free)

> *Not steps for a team—**lenses for a thinker**. Use them to sanity‑check any statement about “how”, “script”, “run”, or “signal”.*

### 6.1 The **stance split** (design vs run)

* If the claim is about **what should be done** or **how it is described**, you are on the **design stance** (Method/MethodDescription).
* If the claim is about **what happened** or **what was emitted**, you are on the **run stance** (Work/Actuation).
* **Guard rule.** Never let a conclusion cross stances without (a) an explicit Bridge kind (*interpretation* vs *substitution*), and (b) an acceptable CL (F.7/F.9, F.10).

### 6.2 The **recipe/idea split**

* **Method** is the **idea**; **MethodDescription** is the **recipe** describing that idea.
* Different recipes may describe the **same** method (profiles, languages, levels of detail); one recipe may encode **several** methods (composite SOP).
* **Naming guard.** Keep labels distinct: *compressive‑strength test* (Method) vs *ASTM C39‑18* (MethodDescription).

### 6.3 The **happening** (Work) with **signal** (Actuation)

* **Work** is the **occurrence** (a PROV *Activity*, an IEC *Task* executing a program, a lab run).
* **Actuation** is the **control output** (setpoint, PWM command, valve open %) emitted **during** Work.
* You can have Work **without** Actuation (analysis job), or Actuation **without** a complex Method (manual push). Many scenarios have **both**.

### 6.4 The **Role Assignment & Enactment touch-points**

* **Roles** (F.4) bind **who enacts** the Method at run‑time (behavioural masks), **not** what permissions they hold (RBAC is a different Context).
* **Statuses** (F.10) bind to the right box: *Approved* → MethodDescription; *Measured/Observed* → Work; *Satisfied/Violated* → Requirement clause about the Work’s outcomes within a **Window**.

## 7 · Harmonisation map (Context‑first)

> Examples of **local SenseCells** and **safe Bridges**. *You may keep the exact Contexts from your F.1 cut.*

**Design (ideas & recipes).**

* *SPEM/ISO 24744 Context*: `SenseCell{Method}` = *Activity Definition / Task Definition*; `SenseCell{MethodDescription}` = *Process Description / WorkProduct* (as recipe).
* *BPMN 2.0 Context*: `SenseCell{MethodDescription}` = *Process (diagram)* as **design‑time** recipe (do not confuse with run).
* *OWL/Kind-CAL Context*: labels for Method kinds (type taxonomies) when needed (naming, not behaviour).

**Run (occurrences & outputs).**

* *PROV‑O Context*: `SenseCell{Work}` = *Activity* (time‑bounded occurrence).
* *SOSA/SSN Context*: Observations **about** Work results (feeds EvidenceStatus).
* *IEC 61131‑3 Context*: `SenseCell{Work}` = *Task executes Program* (runtime); `SenseCell{Actuation}` = *Output command / setpoint* emitted by the program.

**Typical Bridges (with intent).**

* `BPMN:Process (design)` **≈** `SPEM:Process Definition` (design↔design; CL depends on modelling profile; Loss: expressiveness gaps).
* `IEC:Task execution` **⊑** `PROV:Activity` (run↔run; Loss: control‑specific timing semantics, scan cycles).
* `Actuation (IEC)` **⋂** `Activity (PROV)` (intersection: the *sub‑intervals* where outputs are emitted).
* `SOSA:Observation` **interprets** `Requirement clause` (F.10) about **Work outcomes** (**cross‑StatusModality: epistemic→deontic; never substitution**; declare **Bridge(kind=Interpretation, CL, Loss)**).

## 8 · Invariants (normative)

1. **Stance honesty.** Statements about **Method/MethodDescription** (design) **MUST NOT** be used as if they were statements about **Work/Actuation** (run) without an explicit Bridge and Window.
2. **Box discipline.** Every claim about “how”, “recipe”, “run”, or “control output” **MUST** point to the correct box in the quartet.
3. **Context locality.** Terms (*process*, *activity*, *task*, *command*) **MUST** be read as **SenseCells** in their Contexts (F.3); Cross‑context equivalence is a matter for F.7/F.9 Bridges.
4. **Status placement.** *Approved* attaches to MethodDescription; *Observed/Measured* attach to Work; *Satisfied/Violated* attach to clauses about Work outcomes within a **Window** (F.10).
5. **Actuation as Work‑part.** Actuation **MUST** be modelled as **occurring within** (or as a specialised form of) Work on the run stance; it does **not** replace Work.
6. **Naming clarity.** Technical/Plain labels for the quartet **SHOULD** be distinct (F.5); avoid homonymous single‑word labels when Contexts collide.
7. **Bridge guard.** Cross‑context moves **MUST** declare **kind** (≈, ⊑, ⊒, ⋂, ⊥, Interpretation), **CL**, and **Loss** (F.7/F.9).

## 9 · Micro‑examples (didactic, cross‑architheory)

1. **Data pipeline deploy (software).**
   *Method*: “Delta‑load transform”. *MethodDescription*: `etl_delta.py@v3`. *Work*: nightly run 2025‑07‑14. *Actuation*: none.
   *Statuses*: Spec **Approved** (governance Context); Work **Measured** (rows processed) → Evidence for SLO (F.10).

2. **Valve control (industrial).**
   *Method*: PID tuning heuristic. *MethodDescription*: SOP sheet + IEC program. *Work*: PLC task cycle 18:00–18:30. *Actuation*: PWM duty sequence.
   *Bridge*: `IEC:Task` ⊑ `PROV:Activity` (CL=2). Observed setpoint tracking **interprets** requirement “settling time ≤ 5 s”.

3. **Clinical assay (lab).**
   *Method*: ELISA. *MethodDescription*: Kit IFU v7. *Work*: run batch #B217. *Actuation*: pipetting robot commands.
   *Statuses*: Spec **Approved** ≠ batch **Satisfied** (requires evidence at batch Window).

## 11 · Worked examples (extended, multi‑architheory)

> Each scenario names Contexts (from your F.1 cut), identifies the quartet boxes, and shows safe Cross‑context moves.

### 11.1 ML service rollout (software + services + sensing)

* **Contexts:** *SPEM/ISO 24744* (design), *PROV‑O* (run), *SOSA/SSN* (sensing), *ITIL 4* (services).
* **Quartet:**

  * **Method:** *Canary deployment strategy*.
  * **MethodDescription:** *Canary plan document with traffic slices and rollback rules* (design Context).
  * **Work:** *Two canary runs 2025‑08‑02 10:00–12:00* (PROV‑Activities).
  * **Actuation:** *Traffic‑shifting commands* (if modeled, they are outputs inside Work; optional in pure software).
* **Statuses (F.10):** *Spec Approved*; *Work Observed* (latency/err‑rate via SOSA Observations); *SLO clause Satisfied* in Window if measured ≤ thresholds.
* **Bridge(s):** *BPMN (if used) Process (design)* → *PROV Activity (run)* **Interpretation**, CL=2, **Loss:** path vs time granularity.

**Pay‑off:** No one infers SLO satisfaction from a plan. Evidence is about **Work**; the plan stays design‑time.

---

### 11.2 Industrial furnace control (control + sensing + services)

* **Contexts:** *State‑space control texts* (design), *IEC 61131‑3* (run), *PROV‑O* (run), *SOSA/SSN* (sensing), *ITIL 4* (services).
* **Quartet:**

  * **Method:** *PID with feed‑forward*.
  * **MethodDescription:** *Controller tuning sheet + program description*.
  * **Work:** *PLC task cycles 14:00–14:30* (IEC *Task executes Program*), **Bridged** as **PROV Activity**.
  * **Actuation:** *Setpoint & valve duty cycle outputs* emitted during Work.
* **Statuses:** *Spec Approved*; *Work Observed* (temperature curve); requirement *settling time ≤ 5 s* **Satisfied** if the observation within Window meets it.
* **Bridge(s):** `IEC:Task` ⊑ `PROV:Activity` (CL=2, **Loss:** scan‑cycle semantics). `SOSA:Observation` **interprets** requirement clause (CL=3).

**Pay‑off:** Separates **doing** from **pushing**, and both from **measuring**; compliance judged where it belongs.

---

### 11.3 Clinical assay

* **Contexts:** *SPEM/ISO 24744* (design), *Lab assay canon* (design/run split as per discipline), *PROV‑O* (run), *SOSA/SSN* (sensing).
* **Quartet:**

  * **Method:** *ELISA*.
  * **MethodDescription:** *Kit IFU v7 (instructions for use)*.
  * **Work:** *Batch B217 performed 2025‑06‑21* (PROV Activity).
  * **Actuation:** *Pipetting robot commands* (optional detail).
* **Statuses:** *Spec Approved*; *Work Observed* (absorbance readings); *Quality gate Satisfied* within batch Window.
* **Bridge(s):** IFU (design) **interprets** Activity (run) for acceptance (CL=2, **Loss:** deviations allowed per kit tolerances).

**Pay‑off:** A clean line from recipe → run → measurement → decision, without role/status conflation.

---

### 11.4 Incident response (services + enactment)

* **Contexts:** *ITIL 4* (services/design), *BPMN 2.0* (design), *PROV‑O* (run).
* **Quartet:**

  * **Method:** *Triage‑first incident handling*.
  * **MethodDescription:** *Incident workflow diagram + playbook*.
  * **Work:** *Handling INC‑3421, 09:10–10:02* (PROV Activity).
  * **Actuation:** none (unless modeling command invocations as outputs).
* **Statuses:** *Spec Approved*; *Work Observed* (timestamps, response time); *SLO “MTTR ≤ 60 min”* **Satisfied** within the incident Window.
* **Bridge(s):** BPMN (design) → PROV (run) **Interpretation**, CL=2, **Loss:** gateways vs real‑time branching.

**Pay‑off:** MTTR claims are tied to **Work**, not to the playbook.

## 12 · Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas)

> Pure **mental moves**; no storage or workflow is implied.

1. **Box classifier**
   `statement s, Contexts fixed ⊢ box(s) ∈ {Method, MethodDescription, Work, Actuation}`
   *Reading:* Classify any claim by its **box** (design idea, design recipe, run occurrence, control output).

2. **Stance firewall**
   `box(s) ∈ {Method,MethodDescription} ⊢ s ∉ {claims about Work outcomes}`
   *Reading:* A design‑time (stance) statement does **not** assert a run‑time (stance) outcome.

3. **Followed‑recipe judgement**
   `Work w, MethodDescription m ⊢ follows(w,m) ∈ {exact, variant, none}`
   *Reading:* A Work may follow a recipe **exactly**, with a **variant**, or **not at all**; later inferences must respect this value.

4. **Enactment link**
   `Work w, Method h ⊢ enacts(w,h)`
   *Reading:* The occurrence enacts the abstract Method (even if several specs describe it).

5. **Actuation inclusion**
   `Actuation a, Work w ⊢ occursWithin(a,w)`
   *Reading:* Control outputs are **within** (or are parts of) a Work interval.

6. **Observation binding** (KD‑CAL handshake)
   `Observation o about outcome(x) during Window W of Work w ⊢ evidenceFor(w, clause(x,W))`
   *Reading:* Measurements about a Work outcome within a Window serve as evidence for clauses **about that Work**.

7. **Clause evaluation** (F.10 handshake)
   `evidenceFor(w,clause) ⊢ status(clause,w) ∈ {Satisfied, Violated, Inconclusive}`
   *Reading:* A clause about Work yields a status via the observation set.

8. **Context locality**
   `term t, Context C ⊢ meaning(t)@C is local`
   *Reading:* A term’s sense is **local** to its Context; Cross‑context claims require Bridges.

9. **Bridge application** (F.7/F.9)
   `Bridge B: (X@A) ~kind,CL,Loss~ (Y@B); fact about X ⊢ transferableTo(Y) with penalty(CL,Loss)`
   *Reading:* Facts may transfer across Contexts only along a declared Bridge, with the stated penalty.

10. **Version non‑retroactivity**
    `MethodDescription m updated → m' ⊢ ∀ past Work w: follows(w,m')=none (unless w references m')`
    *Reading:* New recipes don’t rewrite history.

11. **Composite reasoning**
    `MethodDescription m = m1 ; m2, Work w executes steps w1,w2 ⊢ enacts(w1,m1) ∧ enacts(w2,m2)`
    *Reading:* Composition on design does not force composition on run, but when it aligns you may relate sub‑runs to sub‑methods.

12. **SLO locus guard**
    `SLO clause about service outcome ⊢ attachesTo(Work-window), not MethodDescription`
    *Reading:* Service obligations concern **what happened** within a Window, not the existence of a plan.

## 13 · Relations

**Builds on:**
E.10.D1 **D.CTX** (Context ≡ `U.BoundedContext`); A.3/**A.3.1**/**A.3.2**/**A.15** (Method/Spec/Work foundations); Sys‑CAL (Actuation semantics); KD‑CAL (Observation); F.1–F.3 (Contexts → SenseCells); F.10 (Status families & Windows).

**Constrains:**

* **F.4 Role Description:** Roles/Statuses **must** point to the right box (e.g., *Approved* → MethodDescription; *Observed* → Work).
* **F.5 Naming:** Enforce distinct Tech/Plain labels for Method/Spec/Work/Actuation where homonyms threaten.
* **F.7/F.9 Bridges:** All Cross‑context assertions among quartet terms **must** go through explicit Bridges with **kind/CL/Loss**.

**Used by.**
Part C architheories (Sys‑CAL, KD‑CAL, Method‑CAL, Kind-CAL, LCA‑CAL) when describing examples, proofs, and cross‑disciplinary mappings.

## 14 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **Split conflated “process”.** Where a single “process” node stands for both plan and run, refactor into **MethodDescription** (design) and **Work** (run); add a Bridge if the prose relied on identity.
2. **Re‑home statuses.** Move any *Approval*‑like statuses from Work to MethodDescription; move *Satisfied/Violated* from Spec to clauses about Work within **Windows**.
3. **Expose actuation.** If control outputs are buried in “execution logs,” mint **Actuation** SenseCells and relate them **within** Work.
4. **Version fences.** Past Works keep references to the **version** of MethodDescription they attempted to follow; don’t update those links retroactively.
5. **Name collisions.** Where *task/activity/process* appear with mixed meanings, prefix with Contexts and relabel per **F.5** (Tech/Plain).
6. **Backfill Bridges.** If earlier text implied Cross‑context equivalence, add explicit Bridges (F.7/F.9) declaring **kind/CL/Loss**.

---

## 15 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept level)

### 15.1 Static conformance checks (SCR)

* **SCR‑F11‑S01 (Stance honesty).** Every normative claim about outcomes is attached to **Work** (with Window), not to **Method/MethodDescription**.
* **SCR‑F11‑S02 (Box placement).** Labels and statuses appear on the correct box (e.g., *Approved* on MethodDescription only).
* **SCR‑F11‑S03 (Actuation inclusion).** All Actuation statements are modeled as **within** a Work interval.
* **SCR‑F11‑S04 (Context discipline).** Each quartet term is expressed as a **SenseCell** with its Context; no Cross‑context identity is asserted here.
* **SCR‑F11‑S05 (Bridge guard).** Any Cross‑context reasoning among quartet terms references an explicit **Bridge** with **kind/CL/Loss**.

### 15.2 Regression checks (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F11‑E01 (Spec update).** When a MethodDescription changes, previous Works remain valid and unchanged; their statuses don’t shift unless re‑evaluated with explicit rationale.
* **RSCR‑F11‑E02 (Bridge drift).** If a Context updates, revisit Bridges that touch quartet terms; adjust **CL/Loss** only via F.7/F.9.
* **RSCR‑F11‑E03 (Status drift).** Adding new statuses does not move them across boxes (e.g., no new “Work‑Approved”).
* **RSCR‑F11‑E04 (Signal creep).** Introducing new Actuation details does not erase or replace Work context.

## 16 · Didactic distillation (90‑second script)

> “When you talk about *how something is done*, decide which of the **four boxes** you mean.
> **Method** is the **idea** (the way). **MethodDescription** is the **recipe** (the description). **Work** is the **happening** (what actually occurred). **Actuation** is the **control push** (signals emitted during Work).
> Keep **design** and **run** as distinct **stances**. Plans and approvals live in the **design stance**; measurements and obligations live in the **run stance** within **Windows**.
> Words like *process*, *task*, *activity*, *command* are **context‑local**—say *process (BPMN)*, *activity (PROV)*, *task (IEC)*. If you must relate them, draw a **Bridge** and declare its **kind**, **CL**, and **Loss**.
> For compliance, don’t point at the plan—point at **Work**, show **Observations**, and judge clauses in **F.10**.
> Hold this quartet in your head and you’ll stop mixing plans with facts, signals with outcomes, and names across Contexts. + Everything else—naming (F.5), `U.RoleDescription` (F.4) and `U.RoleAssignment`/`U.RoleEnactment` (A.2.1/F.6), Bridges (F.7/F.9)—falls into place.

# F.12 — Service Acceptance Binding \[A] 

**“Judge promises on what happened, not on what was planned.”**
**Status.** Architectural pattern \[A], architheory‑agnostic.
**Builds on:** F.1 **context of meaning (U.BoundedContext)**; F.2 **Term Harvesting**; F.3 **Intra‑Context Sense Clustering**; F.5 **Naming Discipline**; F.7/F.9 **Bridges & CL**; F.10 **Status Families & Windows**; F.11 **Method Quartet Harmonisation**; A.2.3 **U.Service**.
**Coordinates with.** KD‑CAL (Observation/Characteristic/Scale); Sys‑CAL (Work/Actuation contexts).
**Non‑goals.** No team workflows, no tooling, no editorial procedures. This pattern specifies **how to think** about acceptance, not how to store or operate systems.

---

## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **conceptual binding** that turns a *service promise* (SLO/SLA clause) into a **clear, local, time‑bounded judgement** about **actual Work**, using **Observations** as evidence and **explicit Bridges** where Cross‑context notions must meet. The result is a **Status** (Satisfied/Violated/Inconclusive) that attaches to the **clause‑about‑that‑Work‑in‑that‑Window**.

**Applicability.** Any situation where a service is promised (availability, latency, safety margin, response time, quality gate, compliance duty) and its fulfilment must be decided from what occurred. Works across digital services, industrial control, laboratory processes, clinical pathways, logistics, etc.

---

## 2 · Problem frame

1. **Plan ≠ proof.** Diagrams and playbooks are treated as if they demonstrated fulfilment.
2. **Signal ≠ outcome.** Control signals (Actuation) are mistaken for the service outcome experienced by the consumer.
3. **Global meanings.** *Availability*, *incident*, *latency* are used as if universal, ignoring context‑local senses.
4. **Unstated translation.** Metrics from one canon are mapped to clauses from another without declaring losses.
5. **Timeless verdicts.** Judgements are asserted with no explicit Window (day, month, batch).

| **Parsimony vs. realism**            | We want a small binding scheme, yet domains differ (percentiles, downtime minutes, control margins).      |
| **Evidence vs. privacy/feasibility** | Observations prove outcomes; sometimes only proxies exist.                                                |

## 4 · Core idea (didactic)

**Bind promises to runs with measurements in time.**
Acceptance is a **quadruple of anchors** (all context‑local):

1. **ClauseCell** — a deontic/contractual **SenseCell** stating the promise (*availability ≥ 99.9%*, *MTTR ≤ 60 min*, *temperature within band*).
2. **WorkCell** — a **SenseCell** for the **Work** that enacted the service in the relevant situation.
3. **MeasureCell** — a **SenseCell** for the **Observation/Characteristic** used as evidence (KD‑CAL).
4. **Window** — the explicit period in which the judgement is made (F.10).

A **Predicate** compares the **Measure** against the **Clause** within the **Window**.
The **Status** (Satisfied/Violated/Inconclusive) attaches to **ClauseCell\@Window about WorkCell**, never to a plan.

---

## 5 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **ClauseCell.** A context‑local deontic/contractual concept (*SLO*, *obligation*, *target*), typically from *services/deontics* Contexts (e.g., **ITIL 4**, **ODRL**).
* **WorkCell.** A context‑local run‑time occurrence (PROV **Activity**, IEC **Task Execution**, etc.).
* **MeasureCell.** A context‑local observation concept (KD‑CAL **Observation** over a **Characteristic** with a **Scale/Unit**).
* **Window.** A time envelope (calendar month, batch, incident interval, shift) per F.10.
* **Predicate.** A clause‑shape: threshold, percentile, count‑within‑limit, band‑conformance, etc.
* **Bridge.** An explicit Cross‑context relation with **kind/CL/Loss** (F.7/F.9).

> **Context discipline.** Terms like *availability*, *activity*, *task*, *observation* are always read as **context‑local**. Cross‑use requires a **Bridge**.

---

## 6 · The binding, as five mental rules (notation‑free)

**R1 — Locus rule.**
A service verdict **attaches to the Clause**, scoped by a **Window**, **about a specific Work**:
`status(ClauseCell, WorkCell, Window) ∈ {Satisfied, Violated, Inconclusive}`.
*Reading:* We do not place “Satisfied” on the plan or on the whole service concept.

**R2 — Evidence rule.**
Only **Observations** (MeasureCell) that **refer to the outcome of the same Work** and **lie within the Window** may support the verdict.
*Reading:* Control commands and approvals are not evidence of outcome.

**R3 — Predicate rule.**
Every ClauseCell is read with a **Predicate** schema that defines how Measures decide:

* **Threshold:** `value ≥/≤ target`.
* **Percentile:** `Pₚ(value) ≤ target`.
* **Ratio/Share:** `good_time / total_time ≥ target`.
* **Count‑within‑limit:** `count(events of type E) ≤ target`.
* **Band:** `min(value) ≥ L ∧ max(value) ≤ U`.

**R4 — Bridge rule.**
If Clause, Work, and Measure live in **different Contexts**, apply declared **Bridges** with **kind**, **CL**, and **Loss** notes.
*Reading:* Without a Bridge, do not presume transferability of meanings.

**R5 — Window rule.**
Every verdict is **time‑bounded**. Changing the Window can change the result; **no retroactivity** from new clauses or specs (cf. F.10).

---

## 7 · Clause templates (conceptual schemata)

> These are **shapes of meaning**, not data fields.

1. **Availability (share‑of‑time)**

* **ClauseCell:** *service availability ≥ 99.9% monthly* (services Context).
* **MeasureCell:** *uptime indicator* over **Work** (KD‑CAL).
* **Predicate:** `good_time/total_time ≥ 0.999`.
* **Window:** calendar month.
* **Bridge:** from monitor semantics → consumer‑perceived availability (**kind:** proxy; **CL:** 2; **Loss:** blind to partial degradations).

2. **Latency (percentile)**

* **ClauseCell:** *p95 latency ≤ 120 ms during incidents* (services Context).
* **MeasureCell:** *response time observation* for the same **Work episode** (KD‑CAL).
* **Predicate:** `P95(latency) ≤ 120ms`.
* **Window:** incident interval.
* **Bridge:** from request‑level telemetry → service‑level promise (**kind:** aggregation; **CL:** 2; **Loss:** sampling bias).

3. **Safety margin (band)**

* **ClauseCell:** *temperature ∈ \[L,U] during batch* (deontics/quality Context).
* **MeasureCell:** *process temperature observation* (KD‑CAL).
* **Predicate:** `min ≥ L ∧ max ≤ U`.
* **Window:** batch run interval (Work).
* **Bridge:** not needed if Measure and Clause are in the same Context; otherwise declare.

4. **MTTR (count‑within‑limit + duration)**

* **ClauseCell:** *MTTR ≤ 60 min per incident*.
* **MeasureCell:** *timestamps of Work phases* (start fix → restore).
* **Predicate:** `restore_time − start_fix ≤ 60 min`.
* **Window:** each incident’s **Work** interval.
* **Bridge:** BPMN design steps → PROV Work **Interpretation** (CL=2; **Loss:** gateways ≠ real branching).

---

## 8 · Invariants (normative)

1. **Design/run split.** Clauses live on the **design stance**; judgements live on the **run stance** about **Work** (F.11).
2. **Context locality.** All terms are **context‑local**; Cross‑context meaning flows **only** across declared **Bridges**.
3. **Observation‑only evidence.** Verdicts require **Observations** that **about‑refer** to Work outcomes; **Actuation** and **Approvals** are not sufficient.
4. **Window explicitness.** Every verdict carries a **Window**; no timeless acceptance.
5. **Predicate declared.** The Clause’s **Predicate** is explicit; no hidden aggregation or default percentile.
6. **Non‑retroactivity.** Updating clauses or specs does not alter past verdicts; re‑evaluation must be explicit.
7. **One‑Work focus.** A verdict references a **specific Work** (or a defined population of Works) matched to the Clause’s scope.
8. **Loss honesty.** Each Bridge states **kind/CL/Loss**; stronger claims require stronger Bridges or same‑Context alignment.

## 9 · Micro‑examples (didactic, multi‑domain)

### 9.1 SaaS uptime (services + sensing)

* **Contexts:** *ITIL 4* (Clause), *PROV‑O* (Work), *SOSA/SSN* (Measure).
* **ClauseCell:** *availability ≥ 99.9% monthly*.
* **WorkCell:** *service provision* Activities during June.
* **MeasureCell:** *uptime observation* from synthetic probes.
* **Predicate:** share‑of‑time ≥ 0.999.
* **Bridge:** probe result → user availability (**kind:** proxy; **CL:** 2; **Loss:** regional gaps).
* **Verdict:** *Satisfied (June)* if the ratio holds; **attaches to Clause\@June about those Works**.

### 9.2 Furnace band (industrial control)

* **Contexts:** *quality/deontics canon* (Clause), *IEC 61131‑3/PROV* (Work), *KD‑CAL* (Measure).
* **ClauseCell:** *product temperature within \[720,740] °C during soak*.
* **WorkCell:** *soak phase* Work interval.
* **MeasureCell:** thermocouple Observations (KD‑CAL).
* **Predicate:** band conformance.
* **Bridge:** IEC task interval → PROV Activity (**Interpretation**, CL=2).
* **Verdict:** *Violated* if any measured value exits the band.

### 9.3 Incident MTTR (services + enactment)

* **Contexts:** *ITIL 4* (Clause), *PROV‑O* (Work).
* **ClauseCell:** *MTTR ≤ 60 min per incident*.
* **WorkCell:** each incident’s handling Activity.
* **MeasureCell:** timestamps (Observed facts) of start‑fix and restore events.
* **Predicate:** duration ≤ 60 min.
* **Bridge:** BPMN steps → PROV Activity (**Interpretation**, CL=2).
* **Verdict:** *Satisfied* if the measured interval meets the target.

## 11 · Extended worked examples (multi‑architheory)

> Each example identifies **Contexts**, the **quadruple** ⟨ClauseCell, WorkCell, MeasureCell, Window⟩, any **Bridge(s)**, and the **Predicate**. The verdict attaches to *ClauseCell\@Window about WorkCell*.

### 11.1 CDN latency across regions (services + sensing + types)

* **Contexts.** *ITIL 4* (Clause), *PROV‑O* (Work), *SOSA/SSN* (Measure), *OWL 2* (type labels).
* **ClauseCell.** *p95 end‑user latency ≤ 200 ms per region per month*.
* **WorkCell.** *delivery Activities* per region during the month (PROV).
* **MeasureCell.** *response‑time Observations* tagged by region and path (SOSA/SSN).
* **Predicate.** For each region in the Window, `P95(latency) ≤ 200 ms`.
* **Bridges.** *probe→user* (**kind**: proxy; **CL** 2; **Loss**: last‑mile bias).
* **Verdict.** Region‑wise statuses; a global “all‑regions met” is the **logical AND** of region statuses (declare this aggregation explicitly).
* **Manager cue.** “Green map ≠ one green verdict”; acceptance is **per Clause per Window per Work population**.

### 11.2 Stroke care: door‑to‑needle (method + enactment + status)

* **Contexts.** *clinical guideline canon* (Clause), *PROV‑O* (Work), *SOSA/SSN* (Measure), *F.10* (status windows).
* **ClauseCell.** *90% of ischemic‑stroke episodes achieve door‑to‑needle ≤ 30 min per quarter*.
* **WorkCell.** Population of **patient‑episode Activities** started in the quarter.
* **MeasureCell.** Timestamps **Observation** of *door* and *needle* events (KD‑CAL).
* **Predicate.** `|{episodes with (needle−door ≤ 30)}| / |{episodes}| ≥ 0.9`.
* **Bridges.** *EHR event semantics → PROV Activity* (**Interpretation**, **CL** 2; **Loss**: missing triage tags).
* **Verdict.** If data gaps exceed a declared tolerance, status is **Inconclusive** rather than “Satisfied by assumption”.

### 11.3 Cold‑chain warehouse (control + sensing + deontics)

* **Contexts.** *quality/deontics canon* (Clause), *IEC 61131‑3/PROV* (Work), *SOSA/SSN + ISO 80000‑1* (Measure).
* **ClauseCell.** *temperature ∈ \[2,8] °C for ≥ 99.5% of each day*.
* **WorkCell.** The warehouse’s **daily storage Activity**.
* **MeasureCell.** Thermistor **Observations** with calibrated units (KD‑CAL/ISO 80000‑1).
* **Predicate.** `(good_time / 24h) ≥ 0.995`.
* **Bridges.** *sensor position → product exposure* (**kind**: proxy; **CL** 2; **Loss**: stratification).
* **Verdict.** *Violated* if any day fails; annotate **Loss** to communicate assurance limits.

### 11.4 SaaS incident MTTR (services + enactment)

* **Contexts.** *ITIL 4* (Clause), *PROV‑O* (Work).
* **ClauseCell.** *MTTR ≤ 60 min per incident*.
* **WorkCell.** Each incident’s handling **Activity**.
* **MeasureCell.** **Observations** of start‑fix and restore timestamps.
* **Predicate.** `(restore − start_fix) ≤ 60 min`.
* **Verdict.** Per incident; a quarter’s report is an explicit aggregation of incident‑scoped verdicts.

## 12 · Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas, notation‑free)

> These are **mental inferences**; they neither read nor write artefacts. Each reads “if these thoughts hold, you may safely conclude …”.

1. **Clause–Work match**
   `covers(ClauseCell, WorkCell) ⊢ admissible(ClauseCell, WorkCell)`
   *Reading:* The Clause speaks **about** the kind of Work under judgement (scope alignment).

2. **Window adequacy**
   `Window is explicit ∧ Window intersects WorkCell-occurrence ⊢ admissible(Window)`
   *Reading:* There is a concrete time envelope; the Work actually occurred within it.

3. **Evidence sufficiency**
   `Observations E about WorkCell within Window ⊢ sufficient(E)`
   *Reading:* There exists a non‑empty set of outcome **Observations** relevant to the Work and Window.

4. **Evidence insufficiency → Inconclusive**
   `¬sufficient(E) ⊢ status = Inconclusive(ClauseCell, WorkCell, Window)`
   *Reading:* Absent admissible evidence, do not guess; mark **Inconclusive**.

5. **Predicate evaluation**
   `sufficient(E) ∧ eval(Predicate, E) = true ⊢ status = Satisfied(ClauseCell, WorkCell, Window)`
   `sufficient(E) ∧ eval(Predicate, E) = false ⊢ status = Violated(ClauseCell, WorkCell, Window)`
   *Reading:* The **Predicate** (threshold/percentile/share/band/…) decides directly from E.

6. **Bridge discipline**
   `usesCrossContexts(ClauseCell, WorkCell, MeasureCell) ∧ Bridges B declared ⊢ admissible(B)`
   `usesCrossContexts … ∧ ¬admissible(B) ⊢ status = Inconclusive`
   *Reading:* Cross‑context comparisons require explicit **Bridges**; without them, **Inconclusive**.

7. **CL aggregation (assurance hint)**
   `Bridges B = {b₁…bₖ} ⊢ effectiveCL = min(CL(bᵢ))`
   *Reading:* The weakest Bridge governs the assurance level communicated with the verdict (advisory to B.3 calculus).

8. **Population clauses**
   `Clause quantifies over population W = {w₁…wₙ} ⊢ status = agg({status(Clause, wᵢ, Window)})`
   *Reading:* For “≥ p%”‑style clauses, compute per‑Work verdicts, then apply the Clause’s quantifier.

9. **Non‑retroactivity**
   `newClause or newMonitor after Window ⊢ doesNotAlter(status@Window)`
   *Reading:* Later changes do not rewrite past verdicts.

10. **Conflict exposure**
    `two admissible Bridge sets ⇒ conflicting statuses ⊢ escalate as Inconclusive, expose Loss notes`
    *Reading:* If equally defensible translations disagree, the honest outcome is **Inconclusive** plus an explanation.

---

## 13 · Relations (with other patterns)

* **Builds on:**
  **F.1** (Contexts): keeps all meanings **local**.
  **F.2–F.3**: provide the **SenseCells** that become Clause/Work/Measure anchors.
  **F.5**: ensures labels for Clause/Work/Measure and Windows are didactically clear.
  **F.7–F.9**: supply **Bridge** kinds / **CL** and loss semantics.
  **F.10**: defines **Status** families and **Window** constructs.
  **F.11**: protects **Method / MethodDescription / Work / Actuation** distinctions.

* **Uses (Part C architheories).**
  **KD‑CAL** (Observation/Characteristic/Scale/Unit).
  **Sys‑CAL** (Work/Actuation Contexts).
  **Kind-CAL** (type labels for populations or cohort selection).

* **Constrains:**
  Later reporting and assurance rules (B.3) must **not** collapse CL/Loss; they report them alongside status.

---

## 14 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **Clause revisions.** Introduce a **new ClauseCell**; keep old verdicts intact (Non‑retroactivity).
2. **Monitor changes.** Update or replace **Bridges** (kind/CL/Loss). Future verdicts use the new Bridge; past ones are annotated, not rewritten.
3. **Scope corrections.** If evidence was about the wrong **Work**, retire the verdict and restate the quadruple; do **not** patch by redefining the Clause.
4. **Unit harmonisation.** When scales/units change, apply **KD‑CAL** conversions inside the Measure’s Context; if Cross‑context mapping is needed, declare a **Bridge**.
5. **Population refinement.** If a Clause’s quantifier is refined (e.g., per‑region → per‑AZ), treat each as a new ClauseCell or a new Window partition; avoid hidden re‑baselining.
6. **Proxy retirement.** When direct Observations become available, prefer them; keep earlier proxy‑based verdicts with their CL/Loss notes.

---

## 15 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

### 15.1 Static conformance (SCR)

* **SCR‑F12‑S01 (Quadruple present).** Every acceptance statement names **ClauseCell**, **WorkCell**, **MeasureCell**, and **Window**.
* **SCR‑F12‑S02 (context‑locality).** Each of the three Cells cites a **Context** (U.BoundedContext).
* **SCR‑F12‑S03 (Evidence admissibility).** The **Observation(s)** are **about** the **same Work** and lie within the **Window**.
* **SCR‑F12‑S04 (Predicate explicit).** The **Predicate** shape is stated (threshold/percentile/share/band/…) with any needed aggregation scope.
* **SCR‑F12‑S05 (Bridge discipline).** Any Cross‑context use declares **Bridge(kind, CL, Loss)**.
* **SCR‑F12‑S06 (Status trichotomy).** The verdict is exactly one of **{Satisfied, Violated, Inconclusive}** and attaches to **ClauseCell\@Window about WorkCell**.
* **SCR‑F12‑S07 (Unit honesty).** MeasureCell specifies **Characteristic, Scale, Unit** (KD‑CAL).
* **SCR‑F12‑S08 (Temporal honesty).** No verdict is asserted without a **Window**; no clause retroactively changes past verdicts.

### 15.2 Regression checks (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F12‑E01 (Bridge update).** When a **Bridge CL** changes, past verdicts stand; future verdicts **reference the new CL**; reports surface the difference.
* **RSCR‑F12‑E02 (Edition churn).** When a Context’s canon updates, Cells reference the **edition**; old verdicts remain bound to their original editions.
* **RSCR‑F12‑E03 (Scope drift guard).** If the Work population definition changes, verdicts are not silently re‑interpreted; new verdicts cite the new population.
* **RSCR‑F12‑E04 (Window partition).** Changing from monthly to weekly windows creates **new** verdicts; monthly summaries are expressed as explicit aggregations of weekly statuses.
* **RSCR‑F12‑E05 (Proxy retirement).** When direct Observations replace proxies, the status computation is re‑run **forward‑only**; past proxy‑based verdicts retain their CL/Loss annotations.

---

### 15.3 Didactic distillation (60‑second recap)

> **Bind promises to runs with measurements in time.**
> Name the **Clause**, the **Work** it talks about, the **Measure** of what actually happened, and the **Window**. Evaluate the Clause’s **Predicate** on Observations **about that Work in that Window**. If any concept crosses Contexts, declare a **Bridge** with **kind/CL/Loss**. The verdict (**Satisfied/Violated/Inconclusive**) attaches to **Clause\@Window about Work**, never to a plan or to the abstract service.

# F.13 — Lexical Continuity & Deprecation \[A] 

**“Change names without changing history.”**
**Status.** Architectural pattern \[A], architheory‑agnostic.
**Builds on:** F.1 **context of meaning**; F.2 **Term Harvesting**; F.3 **Intra‑Context Clustering (SenseCell)**; F.5 **Naming Discipline**; F.7 **Concept‑Set (row) construction**; F.8 **Mint‑or‑Reuse decision**; F.9 **Bridges**; F.10 **Status windows**.
**Coordinates with.** Part C CALs when canon editions change (Sys/KD/Type/Method/LCA).
**Non‑goals.** No registries, workflows, editors, or storage formats. No by‑name Cross‑context equivalence. No silent rewrites of old texts.

---

## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **conceptual discipline** for evolving labels (for **SenseCells**, **Concept‑Set rows**, and **Role Description names**) so that:

* new names **clarify** without erasing what earlier texts meant;
* aliases remain **local to Contexts**;
* genuine sense changes cause **explicit splits/merges** (F.7/F.9), not cosmetic renames.

**Applicability.** Whenever you consider **renaming**, **aliasing**, **deprecating**, or **retiring** any label in FPF: a SenseCell label in a Context, a Concept‑Set row label, or a Role Description name.

---

## 2 · Problem frame

Unification efforts rot when names drift faster than senses or, worse, when senses change under a constant name.

* **Silent relabeling.** A new label is introduced as if nothing changed; readers cannot connect past to present.
* **Alias bloat.** Synonyms accumulate without discipline; reading becomes guesswork.
* **Cross‑context aliasing.** A single alias is made to stand for different Contexts (“global slang”), defeating locality.
* **Retroactive edits.** Old texts are silently rewritten to today’s names, corrupting provenance.

## 4 · Core idea (didactic)

**Treat names as lenses, not objects.**
The **thing that persists** is the *sense* (a **SenseCell** inside a Context, or the *Cross‑context alignment* embodied by a **Concept‑Set row**, or a **Role Description** that points to such sense). Names are **lenses** we look through. When the lens improves, we **record a continuity relation** between lenses; when the underlying sense changes, we **split/merge the thing**, then name accordingly.

> **Contexts keep names local.**
> A label (including aliases) always belongs to **one context** or to **one Concept‑Set row**. Cross‑context similarity is handled by **Bridges** (F.9), never by shared names.

---

## 5 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Legacy label** — a previously used label in the same Context (or same Concept‑Set row / Role Description).
* **Preferred label** — the current **F.5‑conformant** label for that item.
* **Alias** *(context‑local)* — a **read‑path** from a legacy label to the preferred one **inside the same Context** (or the same row/template). For writing, prefer the current label.
* **Continuity relation** — a small set of **relations over labels** (below) that capture whether a change is *just wording* or a *real sense change*.
* **Epoch note** — an **informative** time marker (“used before 2024‑07”) attached to a legacy label to help readers of old texts. (No storage format implied.)

---

## 6 · Solution — Continuity, not “registries”

Rather than maintain a tool or workflow, **think with five continuity relations**. Use the *least strong* relation that tells the truth.

### 6.1 Continuity relations (normative meanings)

1. **`renames(label_old → label_new)`** — *wording improved, sense unchanged*.
   *Use when:* Same **SenseCell** / same **Concept‑Set row** / same **Role Description**; only the surface form changed to satisfy F.5 (morphology, disambiguation, plain/tech harmony).
   *Effect:* `label_old` becomes a **context‑local alias** of `label_new`; both resolve to the **same thing**. Past texts remain valid.

2. **`aliases(label_legacy ↔ label_pref)`** — *legacy synonym kept for reading*.
   *Use when:* A common historical synonym exists **in the same Context** for the **same SenseCell**.
   *Effect:* Two‑way **read‑path** only; **writing uses `label_pref`**. Keep at most **one** legacy alias per register to avoid bloat.

3. **`splits(label_old ⇒ {label_A, label_B})`** — *one label covered multiple senses; now separated*.
   *Use when:* Your **SenseCell** was really two local senses; F.3 has **split** them; or a **Concept‑Set row** is refactored into two rows.
   *Effect:* `label_old` is **deprecated** (read‑path allowed to a **disambiguation note**); new writing uses `label_A`/`label_B`. No claim that either *continues* the old label wholesale.

4. **`merges({label_A, label_B} ⇒ label_new)`** — *two labels now recognized as one sense*.
   *Use when:* F.3 shows **same SenseCell**; or two Concept‑Set rows collapse after F.9 raised CL sufficiently.
   *Effect:* `label_A` and `label_B` become **aliases** of `label_new`. Keep one **epoch note** on each legacy label.

5. **`retires(label_old)`** — *name withdrawn without successor*.
   *Use when:* The label proved misleading and **no single successor** exists (e.g., it spanned different Contexts, or it was metaphorical).
   *Effect:* Only a **read‑warning** remains (“avoid in new writing; see Contexts X/Y”). Readers are pointed to **Bridges** or to multiple rows.

> **Important:** All five relations are **context‑local** (SenseCell level) or **row‑local** (Concept‑Set). **Never** use them to “alias” across Contexts. If a change crosses Contexts, it is not a rename; it requires a **Bridge** (F.9) and often a **split/merge of rows** (F.7).

---

## 7 · Invariants (normative)

1. **Locality of alias.** `aliases(·)` and `renames(·)` operate **within one context** (SenseCell) or **within one Concept‑Set row / Role Description**.
2. **Truth over comfort.** If the **sense changed**, use `splits`/`merges` (and possibly adjust rows/Bridges), **not** `renames`.
3. **Non‑retroactivity.** Past texts remain phrased as written; continuity only **adds read‑paths**, never rewrites.
4. **Alias parsimony.** per Context and per row, keep **≤ 1** legacy alias per register (Tech/Plain); prefer the one readers will most likely encounter.
5. **Prefer present for writing.** In normative writing, use the **current preferred label** (F.5). Aliases are for **reading comprehension**.
6. **Bridge discipline.** If a label shift would require crossing Contexts to “explain”, it is **not a rename**; use **F.9 Bridge** and, if needed, refactor the **Concept‑Set row(s)**.
7. **Epoch honesty.** When declaring continuity, attach a **succinct epoch note** (“pre‑2023 usage”) if it aids readers.

---

## 8 · Self‑checks (mental, not procedural)

* **Same‑sense test.** Can you point to the **same SenseCell** (or same row) before and after? If yes → `renames`/`aliases`. If no → `splits`/`merges`.
* **Context test.** Does the change stay **inside one context**? If it needs two Contexts to explain, it’s a **Bridge**, not a rename.
* **Reader test.** What two legacy strings would a newcomer actually meet in old texts? Keep **those two** as aliases; drop the rest.
* **History test.** Does your “continuity” require editing old claims? If yes, you’re attempting a **retroactive rewrite**—stop.
* **Didactic test.** Can you explain the continuity relation in **one sentence**? If not, you are hiding a sense change.

---

## 9 · Micro‑examples (illustrative)

### 9.1 Pure rename inside a Context (ITIL → clearer plain label)

*Context:* **ITIL 4 (services)**.
Old: **“SLO” (plain: *service target*)** → New: **“service‑level objective” (plain unchanged)**.
**Relation:** `renames("SLO" → "service‑level objective")`.
**Why:** F.5 morphology & expansion; SenseCell unchanged (same clause semantics).
**Effect:** Old guidance remains readable; new writing spells out the term.

### 9.2 Alias for a common legacy synonym (Sys‑CAL)

*Context:* **state‑space control (design)**.
Preferred: **“actuation”**. Legacy: **“control output”**.
**Relation:** `aliases("control output" ↔ "actuation")`.
**Why:** Same SenseCell; legacy term appears in older textbooks.
**Effect:** Readers resolve to the SenseCell; new texts use “actuation”.

### 9.3 Split of a muddled local sense (Enactment)

*Context:* **BPMN 2.0**.
Legacy label **“process”** was used to mean both **“collaboration”** and **“executable process”** in a team’s prose.
**Relation:** `splits("process" ⇒ {"collaboration","executable‑process"})`.
**Effect:** The single Concept‑Set row becomes two; old label is deprecated with a disambiguation note.

### 9.4 Merge after clustering raised confidence (Kind-CAL row)

Two Concept‑Set rows **{“DBaaS”, “Database‑Service”}** converge after F.3 within the same context profile and F.9 raised CL.
**Relation:** `merges({"DBaaS","Database‑Service"} ⇒ "Database‑Service")`.
**Effect:** “DBaaS” becomes a legacy alias with an epoch note.

### 9.5 Not a rename: Cross‑context temptation (forbidden)

*Contexts:* **BPMN (design graph)** vs **PROV‑O (run activity)**.
Temptation: “Let’s rename *process* to *activity*.”
**Diagnosis:** Cross‑context; **different SenseCells**.
**Action:** **No continuity relation.** Keep labels; if needed, declare a **Bridge** (F.9) explaining design→run mapping with CL/Loss.

## 10 · Anti‑patterns & remedies

| #       | Anti‑pattern               | Symptom in texts                                                      | Why it harms thinking                                          | Remedy (conceptual move)                                                                                                         |
| ------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A1**  | **Cross‑context rename**      | “Let’s rename *process (BPMN)* to *activity (PROV)*.”                 | Erases Context boundaries; hides loss; violates locality.         | **Do not rename across Contexts.** Keep both labels; if you must relate them, declare a **Bridge** (F.9) with CL/loss.              |
| **A2**  | **Retroactive rewrite**    | Old passages silently updated to new names.                           | Breaks provenance; misleads readers about what was meant then. | **Non‑retroactivity.** Past texts stand; add **read‑paths** via `renames/aliases`; attach **epoch notes** when helpful.          |
| **A3**  | **Alias flood**            | Long lists of synonyms for comfort.                                   | Raises ambiguity; dilutes teaching signals.                    | **Alias parsimony.** Keep ≤ 1 legacy alias per register (Tech/Plain) **inside the same Context or row**.                            |
| **A4**  | **Paint‑over rename**      | Rename used where sense actually changed.                             | Confuses continuity with revision; hides splits.               | Use **`splits`** (or **`merges`**), not `renames`. If Contexts diverge, adjust **rows** (F.7) and **Bridges** (F.9).                |
| **A5**  | **Global alias**           | One catchy word reused as alias in several Contexts.                     | Creates a pseudo‑global dictionary; invites category errors.   | **Local aliases only.** If a word appears in many Contexts, treat it as **homonymous**; keep Context‑prefixed speech.                  |
| **A6**  | **Euphemism treadmill**    | Frequent cosmetic renames (“modernising” labels) with no gain.        | Cognitive noise; readers lose confidence in names.             | Apply the **Same‑sense test**. If gain is marginal, **do nothing**; if clarity improves materially, one **`renames`** is enough. |
| **A7**  | **Grandfather everything** | Never deprecate confusing legacy labels.                              | Drags ambiguity forward; blocks sharper distinctions.          | When a label truly misleads and has no single successor, **`retires`** with a short **pointer note** to Contexts/rows.              |
| **A8**  | **Row drift via rename**   | Concept‑Set row is relabeled while its membership silently changes.   | Hides that the set changed; breaks Cross‑context alignment.       | First **split/merge rows** (F.7) as needed; only then `renames` the row **if** its intension stayed.                             |
| **A9**  | **Bridge‑by‑alias**        | Using an alias to hint two Contexts are “the same.”                      | Smuggles translation without CL/loss.                          | **No Cross‑context aliasing.** If similarity matters, **Bridge** explicitly (F.9) and keep labels separate.                         |
| **A10** | **Acronym absolutism**     | Treating acronyms as preferred labels everywhere (“SLO” in any Context). | Obscures Context‑specific senses; hurts didactics.                | Prefer **expanded** labels as preferred (F.5); keep acronym as context‑local **alias** only where historically dominant.            |
| **A11** | **Temporal fudge**         | Rename used to imply design↔run shift (“execution ≈ process”).        | Conflates time stances; erases important dualities.            | Keep **design/run** explicit on labels or glosses; if mapping is needed, do so in **F.9**.                                       |
| **A12** | **Over‑canonicalisation**  | Forcing a single “perfect” label across all rows/Contexts.               | Centralises language; breaks heterogeneity guard.              | Let each Context/row keep its **own preferred label**; put unification pressure only into **rows** and **Bridges**.                 |

## 11 · Extended examples (multi‑architheory)

### 11.1 KD‑CAL × Services — *metric target* labels over time

* **Contexts:** *ITIL 4 (services, design)*; *SOSA/SSN (sensing, run)*.
* **Before:** Role Description used **“SLO”** (plain “target”) and readers often saw **“service target”**.
* **Move:** `renames("SLO" → "service‑level objective")` (Context: ITIL). Keep `aliases("service target" ↔ "service‑level objective")`.
* **Why:** Same local sense; clearer morphology for F.5; SOSA/SSN labels untouched.
* **Pay‑off:** Runtime **Observations** (SOSA) are later compared to **service‑level objective** clauses (ITIL) without Cross‑context aliasing.

### 11.2 Sys‑CAL × LCA‑CAL — separating *execution* vs *actuation*

* **Contexts:** *IEC 61131‑3 (run)*; *state‑space control texts (design)*.
* **Temptation:** Rename **“task execution”** to **“actuation”** “to sound control‑ish”.
* **Diagnosis:** Different Contexts; different SenseCells (program run vs control output).
* **Move:** **No rename.** Keep labels; later add **Bridge** “`execution (IEC)` *produces* signals that realise `actuation (control)`” with CL stating partial coverage.
* **Pay‑off:** Plant narratives stop calling programs “actuators”; runtime vs control semantics stay crisp.

### 11.3 Kind-CAL × Method‑CAL — false merge avoided

* **Contexts:** *OWL 2 (types, design)*; *SPEM 2.0 (methods, design)*.
* **Issue:** A row labeled **“Class”** tried to absorb **“WorkProductKind”** by a `renames`.
* **Diagnosis:** Not same sense; different calculi (type vs artefact category).
* **Move:** **Split the row**: `splits("class" ⇒ {"type‑class","work‑product‑category"})`.
* **Pay‑off:** Downstream Role Descriptions can point to the correct **SenseCell** without redefining ontological commitments.

### 11.4 Enactment × KD‑CAL — retiring a misleading metaphor

* **Context:** *BPMN 2.0 (design)*.
* **Legacy:** Team jargon **“heartbeat”** used for a **timer event**. Newcomers confuse it with **sensor heartbeats** (KD‑CAL).
* **Move:** `retires("heartbeat")` in BPMN Context with note “use **timer event**; ‘heartbeat’ refers to sensor liveness in KD‑CAL”.
* **Pay‑off:** Two different ecosystems stop colliding on the same catchy word.

### 11.5 Concept‑Set row refactor after rising CL

* **Rows:** `{“DBaaS”, “Database‑Service”}` representing service notions across several Contexts.
* **F.3 + F.9 outcome:** High CL; evidence of same Cross‑context alignment.
* **Move:** `merges({"DBaaS","Database‑Service"} ⇒ "Database‑Service")` at **row level**. Both legacy labels become row‑local aliases with epoch notes.
* **Pay‑off:** One clearer row label; old articles still understandable.

## 12 · Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas, notation‑free)

> Each judgement is a **pure thought**: premises ⇒ safe conclusion. No storage, no workflow, no roles.

Let **`ContextOf(ℓ)`** be the Context of label **ℓ** (when ℓ names a SenseCell); **`rowOf(ℓ)`** the Concept‑Set row (when ℓ names a row); **`senseOf(ℓ)`** the SenseCell it denotes (if local); **`pref(thing)`** the current preferred label of a SenseCell / row / Role Description.

### 12.1 Same‑sense & same‑place

`ContextOf(ℓ₁)=ContextOf(ℓ₂) ∧ senseOf(ℓ₁)=senseOf(ℓ₂) ⊢ mayRename(ℓ₁→ℓ₂)`
*Reading:* If two labels denote **the same SenseCell in the same Context**, a rename is legitimate.

### 12.2 Local alias

`ContextOf(ℓ₁)=ContextOf(ℓ₂) ∧ senseOf(ℓ₁)=senseOf(ℓ₂) ⊢ aliases(ℓ₁↔ℓ₂)`
*Reading:* Legacy synonym can be kept **as a read‑path**; writing uses `pref`.

### 12.3 Split detection

`coversMultipleLocalSenses(ℓ) ⊢ splits(ℓ ⇒ {ℓA,ℓB,...})`
*Reading:* If one label straddles several local senses, declare a split and prefer the new precise labels.

### 12.4 Merge admission

`ContextOf(ℓA)=ContextOf(ℓB) ∧ senseOf(ℓA)=senseOf(ℓB) ⊢ merges({ℓA,ℓB} ⇒ ℓN)`
*Reading:* Once F.3 shows identity of sense **within** a Context, merging labels into one preferred label is safe.

### 12.5 Retirement

`misleading(ℓ) ∧ ¬∃ℓ' sameSense(ℓ,ℓ') ⊢ retires(ℓ)`
*Reading:* If a label misleads and has **no single** successor, retire it and point readers to relevant Contexts/rows.

### 12.6 Cross‑context guard

`ContextOf(ℓ₁) ≠ ContextOf(ℓ₂) ⊢ ¬mayRename(ℓ₁→ℓ₂)`
*Reading:* Different Contexts forbid rename/alias; any relation goes to **Bridge** (F.9).

### 12.7 Writing discipline

`thing t ⊢ writeWithPreferred(t) = pref(t)`
*Reading:* Normative prose uses the **current** preferred label; aliases are for reading.

### 12.8 Reading resolution

`legacyLabel ℓ ⊢ readResolve(ℓ) = ⟨thing, pref(thing), epoch?⟩`
*Reading:* A reader can mentally resolve a legacy label to the **thing** and its present name, with epoch hint if needed.

### 12.9 Alias budget

`aliasesFor(thing, register=r) = A ⊢ |A| ≤ 1`
*Reading:* Keep at most one legacy alias per register (Tech/Plain) for any one thing.

### 12.10 Row‑level continuity

`rowOf(ℓA)=rowOf(ℓB)=R ∧ intension(R) stable ⊢ mayRenameRow(R,ℓB)`
*Reading:* A row label can change if the **row’s membership/intension** did not change; otherwise refactor rows first (F.7).

---

## 13 · Relations

**Builds on:**
F.1 **context of meaning** (keeps locality), F.2 **Harvesting** (provides attested strings), F.3 **Clustering** (establishes SenseCells), F.5 **Naming Discipline** (supplies preferred labels), F.7 **Concept‑Set rows**, F.8 **Mint‑or‑Reuse**, F.9 **Bridges**, F.10 **Status windows**, F.11 **Method harmonisation**, F.12 **Service acceptance**.

**Constrains:**

* **F.5 (Naming):** may select preferred labels **only** after applying these continuity relations.
* **F.7 (Rows):** row relabels require row **intension** stability; otherwise use **split/merge rows**.
* **F.9 (Bridges):** Cross‑context changes must **not** be expressed as renames/aliases.

**Used by.**
All Part C architheories when editions shift; all examples and tutorials when teaching with legacy terminology.

---

## 14 · Migration notes (conceptual playbook)

1. **Ask the same‑sense question first.** If the underlying **SenseCell/row** is unchanged, prefer `renames`; else reach for `splits/merges`.
2. **Keep it inside the Context.** If your explanation crosses Contexts, stop—this is **Bridge** territory (F.9), not a rename.
3. **Prefer clarity over fashion.** Rename only when the new label **removes a real ambiguity** (F.5 criteria), not to chase style.
4. **Limit nostalgia.** Admit **one** legacy alias in each register that readers will most likely meet; leave the rest to footnotes in examples.
5. **Deprecate with kindness.** When retiring a label, add a one‑line **pointer note** (e.g., “see `timer event` in BPMN; ‘heartbeat’ in KD‑CAL means sensor liveness”).
6. **Rows before names.** If a rename request coincides with a shift in what the row covers, **refactor rows** (F.7) first, then choose labels.
7. **Edition bumps.** When a canon updates, check labels used in that Context: if definitions shift, it’s a **split/merge**; if not, you may `renames` for style/uniformity.
8. **Teach the delta.** In primers, show a **mini table** with legacy → preferred pairs only where readers will encounter both.

---

## 15 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

### 15.1 Static conformance (SCR)

* **SCR-F13-S01 (context-local continuity).** Every `renames/aliases` relates labels **within the same context** or the **same row/Role Description**; none cross Contexts.
* **SCR‑F13‑S02 (Truthfulness).** For each `renames`, there exists an unchanged **SenseCell/row**; otherwise the move is rejected.
* **SCR‑F13‑S03 (Alias budget).** For any one thing and register, the number of legacy aliases is **≤ 1**.
* **SCR‑F13‑S04 (Non‑retroactivity).** No requirement or suggestion to rewrite past texts is present; continuity is expressed as **read‑paths**.
* **SCR‑F13‑S05 (Row integrity).** A row rename occurs only when the row’s **intension** is stable; if membership changed, a **row split/merge** is documented (F.7).
* **SCR‑F13‑S06 (Bridge discipline).** No alias/rename is used to imply Cross‑context sameness; any such relation is deferred to **F.9**.

### 15.2 Regression (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F13‑E01 (Edition drift audit).** When a canon edition changes, all labels from that Context are checked against definitions; moves are `renames` if senses stable, else `splits/merges`.
* **RSCR‑F13‑E02 (Alias creep check).** Periodically ensure alias budgets remain within **≤ 1 per register**; surplus aliases are pruned.
* **RSCR‑F13‑E03 (Bridge leak check).** Scan continuity notes for Cross‑context hints; any such case is converted into a **Bridge** or deleted.
* **RSCR‑F13‑E04 (Didactic continuity).** Sampling of examples shows that readers can **resolve** legacy labels to current ones without confusion (via the continuity notes).

---

## 16 · Didactic distillation (60‑second script)

> **Names are lenses.** The *thing* that persists is the **sense** (a SenseCell in a Context, a Concept‑Set row, a Role Description). When you improve a lens, use **`renames`** or **`aliases`** **inside that same place**. When the *thing* changes, say so with **`splits/merges`**—and adjust rows/Bridges accordingly. **Never rename across Contexts.** Keep at most **one** legacy alias per register. Do **not** rewrite history; give readers **read‑paths** and brief epoch notes. With this discipline, you can clarify language without erasing meaning, and your models keep both **continuity** and **truth**.

# F.14 — Anti‑Explosion Control (Roles & Statuses) \[A] 

**“Name less, express more.”**

**Status.** Architectural pattern \[A], architheory‑agnostic.
**Depends on.** F.1 **context of meaning**; F.2 **Harvesting**; F.3 **Local Sense Clustering**; F.4 **Role Description**; F.5 **Naming Discipline**; F.7 **Concept‑Set Table**; F.8 **Mint‑or‑Reuse**.
**Coordinates with.** F.10 **Status Windows & Mapping**; F.11 **Method Quartet Harmonisation**; F.12 **Service Acceptance Binding**; F.13 **Lexical Continuity**.
**Aliases (informative).** *Role/Status economy*; *Explosion guard*.

---

## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Prevent the uncontrolled growth of **Roles** and **Statuses** by privileging **reuse**, **bundling**, **explicit separation‑of‑duties (SoD)**, and **applicability windows** over minting new names. Keep the vocabulary **small, crisp, and composable** while remaining faithful to local meanings fixed by Contexts (F.1) and SenseCells (F.3).

**Applicability.** Whenever a new Role/Status is proposed, a team merges two lines of work, or a domain shifts its jargon. Use this pattern before adding rows to the Concept‑Set Table (F.7) or new Role Descriptions (F.4).

**Non‑goals.** No org charts, no RBAC policies, no process roles. This pattern describes **mental moves** for architectural naming, not governance machinery.

---

## 2 · Problem frame

Left unchecked, Role/Status vocabularies tend to **diverge**:

1. **Synonym stacks.** *Reviewer*, *Approver*, *Validator*, *Verifier* minted separately despite overlapping responsibilities.
2. **Modifier creep.** *Night‑Operator*, *Shift‑Operator*, *Remote‑Operator* proliferate where one Role plus a window would suffice.
3. **SoD leakage.** New names invented to **evade** an intended separation (*Requestor‑Approver* as one Role).
4. **Status paintjobs.** *Compliant*, *At‑Risk*, *Grace*, *Waived*, *Temporarily‑Breached*—labels multiply where a **single Status × window** model would be clearer.
5. **Context blending.** A control‑Context *Actuator* gets treated as an Enactment *Execution* Role; a deontic *Duty* becomes a runtime *Status*.

Explosion harms didactics and increases alignment cost (F.9).

---

## 4 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Role Description** (F.4): a **Role** (behavioural mask) or **Status** (epistemic/deontic standing) tied to a **SenseCell**.
* **Concept‑Set row** (F.7): a Cross‑context **intent** (“what we count as one thing”) aligned by SenseCells.
* **Bundle** (this pattern): a **named composition** of Role Descriptions that are meant to be used together by design (e.g., {Requester, Approver} for change control). A Bundle is a **concept**, not a package.
* **SoD Constraint** (this pattern): a **conceptual rule** stating that two Roles **must not** be played by the same Holder in the **same window**.
* **Window** (F.10): an **claim scope** (time stance, holon level, run segment) that delimits when a Role/Status holds.

---

## 5 · Core idea (didactic)

**Use four levers before minting a name:**

1. **Reuse the row.** If the intent matches an existing Concept‑Set row and the local SenseCell is already present, **use it**.
2. **Bundle, don’t blur.** When two Roles must travel together, **name the Bundle**, not a new hybrid Role.
3. **Declare SoD, don’t fuse.** When Roles must stay apart, **state the SoD** instead of minting a “super‑role.”
4. **Window, don’t multiply.** When a Status looks different across time/scale, keep **one Status** with **explicit windows**.

---

## 6 · Solution — the control cabinet (conceptual, notation‑free)

### 6.1 Reuse by row (first lever)

* **Move.** If a proposal matches the **intension** of an existing row (F.7), adopt its Role Description or add a local SenseCell **inside that row**.
* **Pay‑off.** Names don’t proliferate; Cross‑context tables stay thin.

**Example (services).** *Service‑availability‑compliance* already exists as a row. New labels *SLO‑Met* / *Uptime‑OK* **reuse** that row; SOSA/SSN Observations later feed it (F.12).

---

### 6.2 Bundle instead of hybrid (second lever)

* **Move.** When practice always pairs two Roles, define a **Bundle** `{RoleA, RoleB}`.
* **Not a hybrid.** Do **not** coin *RoleAB*; you’ll erase SoD options and obscure responsibilities.

**Example (enactment).** `{Requester, Approver}` is a Bundle. *Request‑Approver* (one Role) is **not** allowed; it contradicts intended checks.

---

### 6.3 Separate by SoD, don’t evade (third lever)

* **Move.** Record **SoD constraints** where separation matters (“Requester ⟂ Approver in run window”).
* **Why here.** SoD belongs to **semantics**, not org policy; it protects structure across Contexts and times.

**Example (methods).** `{Author ⟂ Reviewer}` in the **review window**. A proposal *Senior‑Reviewer* to “do both” is rejected; the **Bundle** remains `{Author, Reviewer}` with SoD.

---

### 6.4 Window the Status (fourth lever)

* **Move.** Keep a single Status and attach **windows** for *grace*, *evaluation*, *active*, *archival*.
* **Avoid.** *Compliant*, *At‑Risk*, *Grace* as separate Status types.

**Example (acceptance).** **Compliance** Status has readings per window:

* *evaluation window:* “pending check”,
* *active window:* “met / breached”,
* *grace window:* “temporarily tolerated breach”.
  One Status; clear windows.

---

### 6.5 Factor modifiers as facets, not names

* **Move.** Treat qualifiers (shift, locality, domain) as **facets** of the same Role/Status or as **windows**, not new types.

**Example (operations).** *Operator* with **window facet** `timeOfDay = night`—not a new Role *Night‑Operator*.

---

## 7 · Invariants (normative)

1. **context‑locality.** Each Role Description remains tied to a **SenseCell** in a **single Context** (F.3, F.4).
2. **Row preference.** New Role Descriptions **SHOULD** map to an existing row; new rows (F.7) require F.8 justification.
3. **No hybrid Roles.** If two Roles are conceptually distinct, they **must not** be fused into one to bypass SoD. Use **Bundle + SoD**.
4. **Windowed statuses.** Status proliferation across time/scale **MUST** be expressed as **windows** of a single Status family (F.10).
5. **Bundle clarity.** A Bundle **names only composition**; it does not inherit or redefine member semantics.
6. **Minimal modifier naming.** Adding a modifier to a label **MUST** pass F.5 tests; prefer facets/windows over new Role/Status names.
7. **Concept‑first.** No invariant relies on organization charts or access policies; **semantics precede governance**.

---

## 8 · Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas)

> Pure mental moves; no tools, no workflows.

Let **`rowOf(τ)`** be the Concept‑Set row of template **τ**, **`senseOf(τ)`** its SenseCell, **`win(τ)`** its window set.

1. **Row reuse admissibility**
   `intent(τₙ) ≡ intent(row r) ∧ ∃σ: senseOf(σ) in r ⊢ reuseRow(τₙ → r)`
   *Reading:* If the proposed template’s intent matches an existing row with a local SenseCell, reuse the row.

2. **Bundle recommendation**
   `alwaysTogether{α,β} ∧ distinct(α,β) ⊢ bundle({α,β})`
   *Reading:* If two distinct Roles occur together by design, name the Bundle.

3. **SoD necessity**
   `conflictRisk{α,β} ∧ sameHolder ∧ sameWindow ⊢ SoD(α ⟂ β)`
   *Reading:* If the same Holder in the same window would create a conflict, require SoD.

4. **Hybrid rejection**
   `SoD(α ⟂ β) ⊢ forbid(hybrid(α,β))`
   *Reading:* A SoD pair cannot be fused into one Role.

5. **Windowing over multiplication**
   `status σ showsVariantsAcross(w₁,…,wₖ) ⊢ keepOneStatus(σ) ∧ win(σ)={w₁,…,wₖ}`
   *Reading:* Variants across time/scale become windows, not new Status names.

6. **Facet over rename**
   `modifier m changes circumstance ¬ essence ⊢ preferFacet(τ,m)`
   *Reading:* If a modifier alters circumstances only, represent it as a facet/window.

## 9 · Micro‑examples (engineer / manager / researcher lenses)

### 9.1 Enactment (change control)

* **Proposal.** *Requester‑Approver* as a single Role “to move faster.”
* **Moves.** SoD(`Requester ⟂ Approver`) + **Bundle** `{Requester, Approver}`.
* **Result.** Same throughput, preserved checks, no hybrid Role.

### 9.2 Services (SLO evaluation)

* **Proposal.** New Status *At‑Risk*.
* **Moves.** Keep **Compliance** Status; add **grace window** and a **forecast facet** (informative) if needed.
* **Result.** One Status with windows; fewer names, clearer timelines.

### 9.3 KD‑CAL (evidence)

* **Proposal.** *Pre‑validated* between *Verified* and *Validated*.
* **Moves.** Use **Status chain** within one family: `Verified → Validated`; represent uncertainty as **confidence** (F.10), not another Status.
* **Result.** Clean ladder; no extra label.

### 9.4 Sys‑CAL (plant ops)

* **Proposal.** *Night‑Operator*, *Remote‑Operator*.
* **Moves.** **Role:** Operator; **facets/windows:** `timeOfDay`, `presenceMode`.
* **Result.** One Role, portable qualifiers.

### 9.5 Method quartet (reviews)

* **Proposal.** *Senior‑Reviewer* to bypass `{Author ⟂ Reviewer}`.
* **Moves.** Keep SoD; if seniority matters, introduce **Assurance Level** facet (F.10) on the **review decision**, not a new Role.
* **Result.** Separation preserved; trust expressed as a Status property, not a Role type.

## 11 · Worked examples (multi‑architheory)

### 11.1 Enactment + Services + KD‑CAL — “SLO compliance without label sprawl”

**Contexts.** ITIL 4 (services), SOSA/SSN (sensing), PROV‑O (run).
**Intent.** Track SLO compliance with minimal Status vocabulary.

* **Naïve proposal.** Statuses: *Compliant*, *At‑Risk*, *Breached*, *Grace*, *Waived*.
* **Moves (F.14).** Keep **Compliance** as one **Status family**; define **windows**: *evaluation* (prediction against forecast), *active* (actuals vs target), *grace* (tolerated breach). **Waiver** becomes a **deontic Status** in ODRL Context, not part of Compliance.
* **Outcome.** One Status + windows; observations (SOSA) and provenance (PROV) feed the *active* window; service policy (ITIL/ODRL) defines *grace*.

### 11.2 Method‑CAL + Enactment — “Reviews with SoD and Bundle”

**Contexts.** SPEM/ISO 24744 (methods), Enactment lexicon.
**Intent.** Prevent authors reviewing their own work while keeping names lean.

* **Naïve proposal.** Roles: *Author*, *Self‑Reviewer*, *Peer‑Reviewer*, *Senior‑Reviewer*.
* **Moves.** Roles **Author**, **Reviewer** only; **SoD(Author ⟂ Reviewer)** in the **review window**. If practice needs two reviewers, mint **Bundle** `{Reviewer, Reviewer₂}`; express **seniority** as a **facet** on the *decision* (Assurance Level), not a new Role.
* **Outcome.** Two Roles, one Bundle, one SoD; no hybrid Role; assurance is visible as a property of the review result.

### 11.3 Sys‑CAL + LCA‑CAL + Services — “Operations without role fragments”

**Contexts.** IEC 61131‑3 (execution), state‑space control texts (actuation), ITIL 4 (services).
**Intent.** Staff coverage across shifts and locations without ten operator types.

* **Naïve proposal.** *Night‑Operator*, *Remote‑Operator*, *Local‑Operator*, *Shift‑Lead*, *On‑call‑Operator*.
* **Moves.** **Role** = **Operator**; add **facets/windows**: `timeOfDay`, `presenceMode`, `dutyCycle`. If coordination is distinct, mint **Coordinator** Role; when both occur together, **Bundle** `{Operator, Coordinator}`; keep **SoD** where needed (e.g., `Operator ⟂ Approver` for production change).
* **Outcome.** One Role + small facet set + Bundle; clean hooks to execution and actuation semantics.

### 11.4 KD‑CAL + Kind-CAL — “Evidence ladder without new labels”

**Contexts.** KD‑CAL (evidence), OWL 2/FCA (types).
**Intent.** Express proof maturity without inflating Status names.

* **Naïve proposal.** *Candidate‑Evidence*, *Preliminary‑Evidence*, *Verified‑Evidence*, *Validated‑Evidence*.
* **Moves.** Keep one **Evidence Status** ladder (`Collected → Verified → Validated`); use **Assurance Level** facet (numeric or ordinal) and **windows** for in‑review vs active. Align *types* in a **row**; do not mint new Status names for granularity.
* **Outcome.** Short vocabulary, clear ladder, quantitative facet where nuance is needed.

---

## 12 · Relations (with other patterns)

* **Builds on:** F.1 (Contexts), F.2 (Harvesting), F.3 (Local Clustering), F.4 (Role Description), F.5 (Naming).
* **Constrains:**

  * **F.7 (Concept‑Set Table):** prefer **row reuse**; new rows require F.8 justification.
  * **F.8 (Mint‑or‑Reuse):** apply **four levers** (reuse, bundle, SoD, window) before minting.
  * **F.10 (Status Windows & Mapping):** encode temporal/scale variation as **windows**, not new Status types.
  * **F.12 (Service Acceptance Binding):** bind acceptance to the **Compliance** Status family; avoid ad‑hoc status labels.
  * **F.13 (Lexical Continuity):** prior names become **aliases**; do not carry forward inflated vocabularies as new types.
* **Used by.** Architheory examples across Part C to keep Role/Status vocabularies tight.

---

## 13 · Migration notes (conceptual playbook)

1. **Map to rows.** For each existing Role/Status, identify its **Concept‑Set row**; if two names share an intent, **collapse** to one row (keep other names as **aliases**, F.13).
2. **Extract SoD.** Replace “super‑roles” with **Bundles** plus explicit **SoD**; where conflict exists, SoD is **normative**, not cultural.
3. **Demote modifiers.** Convert adjectival Role types into **U.Facet** (per Compose‑CAL) or **windows** on the base Role.
4. **Window statuses.** Merge Status families split by time/scale into **one Status + windows**; move waived/exempt notions to the **deontic Context** if applicable.
5. **Re‑use before minting.** When encountering a gap, scan rows for a near‑match; only if intent genuinely differs, open a **new row** (F.8).
6. **Preserve continuity.** Keep historic labels as **aliases** under the consolidated template (F.13); do not rewrite past texts.
7. **Rehearse the cut.** After consolidation, you should be able to recite the entire Role/Status vocabulary **from memory**; if not, reduce again.

---

## 14 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR — concept‑level)

### 14.1 SCR — Static conformance

* **SCR‑F14‑S01 (Row reuse).** Every newly proposed Role Description either **references an existing row** or includes a clear **F.8 justification** for a new row.
* **SCR‑F14‑S02 (No hybrids).** No Role Description’s label or definition **conflates** two Roles that stand in a declared **SoD** relation.
* **SCR‑F14‑S03 (Windowed statuses).** Each Status family that shows temporal/scale variation is expressed as **one Status + windows** (not multiple Status types).
* **SCR‑F14‑S04 (Facet over modifier).** Role names do not encode circumstantial modifiers; such modifiers appear only as **facets/windows**.
* **SCR‑F14‑S05 (Context locality).** Every Role Description is anchored to **exactly one SenseCell**; no Cross‑context semantics inside a single template.
* **SCR‑F14‑S06 (Bundles are pure).** Every **Bundle** is a **set of templates** with **no additional semantics** beyond membership and referenced **SoD**.

### 14.2 RSCR — Regression (evolution)

* **RSCR‑F14‑E01 (Vocabulary slope).** Over a given interval, the count of distinct Role/Status templates **does not increase** unless matched by **row justifications** (F.8).
* **RSCR‑F14‑E02 (SoD integrity).** Adding templates does not introduce a label that **circumvents** any existing **SoD** relation.
* **RSCR‑F14‑E03 (Window integrity).** When windows are refined, **Status type count** remains constant; only window definitions change.
* **RSCR‑F14‑E04 (Alias discipline).** When labels change, prior names are recorded as **aliases** (F.13); no silent type multiplication.

## 15 · Didactic distillation (90‑second script)

> **Name less, express more.** Before minting a new Role or Status, try **four levers**:
> **(1) Reuse the row** — if the intent already exists, adopt it and add your local SenseCell.
> **(2) Bundle, don’t blur** — when two Roles travel together, **Bundle** them; keep **SoD** if they must stay apart.
> **(3) Declare SoD, don’t fuse** — conflicts of interest are solved with **SoD**, not with “trusted” super‑roles.
> **(4) Window, don’t multiply** — one **Status** can wear different **windows** (evaluation/active/grace); that’s not four Status types.
> Keep modifiers as **facets**, not names; keep every Role Description **context‑local** via its SenseCell. If your vocabulary no longer fits in a thoughtful mind, you have an **explosion**—return to the levers and reduce.

# F.15 — SCR/RSCR Harness for Unification \[A] 

**“Prove locality and parsimony first; only then prove composition.”**
**Status.** Architectural pattern \[A], architheory‑agnostic.
**Builds on:** E.10.D1 **Lexical Discipline for “Context” (D.CTX)**; F.0.1 **Foundational Principles**; F.1–F.14.
**Coordinates with.** B.3 **Trust & Assurance Calculus** (for CL use on Bridges).

---

## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **minimal, notation‑free harness of conceptual checks** that tells you whether a unification slice is **sound**: Contexts are fixed and diverse (F.1), terms are harvested and clustered **inside** Contexts (F.2–F.3), Role Descriptions **point to one SenseCell** (F.4), names obey discipline (F.5), rows are reused instead of multiplied (F.7–F.8), bridges are **explicit and penalised** (F.9), statuses vary by **windows** not type proliferation (F.10), and cross‑line bindings (F.11–F.12) respect locality.
**Applicability.** Use whenever you declare or revise any of: Context cards, Local‑Senses, SenseCells, Concept‑Set rows, Role Descriptions, Bridges, Status windows.
**Non‑goals.** No registries, workflows, or storage formats. No team roles. No metrics dashboards. This is **thinking discipline**, not governance.

---

## 2 · Problem frame

Without a unification harness:

1. **Locality leaks.** Cross‑context equivalence creeps in “by name”.
2. **Row sprawl.** Concept‑Set tables grow laterally with near‑duplicates.
3. **Role/Status inflation.** Adjectival or temporal variants become new types.
4. **Silent rewrites.** New editions overwrite old meanings without a trace.
5. **Unstable bridges.** Cross‑context relations harden into dogma without CL or loss statements.

---

## 3 · Forces

| Force                      | Tension to resolve                                                    |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parsimony vs coverage**  | Keep vocabularies small yet expressive across multiple Contexts.         |
| **Locality vs reuse**      | Preserve context‑local meaning while enabling Cross‑context comparison.     |
| **Stability vs evolution** | Allow new editions and rows without erasing prior sense.              |
| **Clarity vs formality**   | Checks must be teachable in minutes yet strong enough to catch drift. |

---

## 4 · Core idea (didactic)

The harness is a **two‑tier net of assertions**:

* **SCR — Static Conformance Rules.** context‑local and cross‑artefact checks that must hold **now**.
* **RSCR — Regression & Stability Rules.** Checks that must hold **across changes** (editions, rows, names).

All checks are expressed as **judgement schemas** (premises ⊢ conclusion). They **never** prescribe artefact formats, roles, or workflows.

---

## 5 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Unification line (L).** The thematic cut you are pursuing (e.g., Enactment + Sensing + Execution).
* **Check.** A content‑level assertion about Contexts, senses, rows, Role Descriptions, bridges, or windows.
* **Witness.** A **thoughtful minimal example** that makes a check concrete (e.g., one seed, one bridge pair).
* **Slice.** The small set of objects under scrutiny together (Contexts in view, the row you’re adding, the Role Description that uses it, and any bridge it needs).

---

## 6 · Objects under check

1. **Contexts** — `U.BoundedContext` cards (F.1).
2. **Local‑Sense** — clustered sense inside one context (F.3).
3. **SenseCell** — *(Context × Local‑Sense)* address (F.3/F.4).
4. **Concept‑Set row** — a cross‑projection hypothesis of “the same thing” (F.7).
5. **Role Description** — Role/Status definition pointing to **one** SenseCell (F.4).
6. **Bridge** — explicit Cross‑context relation with CL and loss notes (F.9).
7. **Windows** — temporal/scale views for a Status family (F.10).
8. **Aliases** — name continuity commitments (F.13).
9. **Bundles & SoD** — reuse levers that replace hybrid roles (F.14).

---

## 7 · Solution overview — the harness as a lattice of checks

The harness arranges checks in three clusters:

* **S‑Local.** context‑local sanity (anchoring, clustering, two‑register labels).
* **S-Cross.** Cross-artefact coherence (row reuse, single-cell **Role Description**, bridge discipline, window honesty).
* **R‑Evo.** Evolution continuity (no silent rewrites, no vocabulary creep, bridge re‑validation).

This Part 1 enumerates **SCR** (S‑Local and S‑Cross). Part 2 covers **RSCR**, anti‑patterns, worked “dry runs”, and acceptance summaries.

---

## 8 · SCR — Static conformance rules (S‑Local)

> All S‑Local rules are **Context‑internal** and derive only from F.1–F.5.

**SCR‑F15‑S1 (Anchored term).**
`Seed σ has context C ⊢ C ∈ Contexts(L)`
*Reading:* Every harvested seed lives in a Context that is **deliberately in view** for your line (F.1, F.2).

**SCR‑F15‑S2 (Edition trace).**
`Occurrence ω supports σ ⊢ ω carries edition+location`
*Reading:* A Local‑Sense can be mentally reconstructed from attestations (F.2).

**SCR‑F15‑S3 (Intra‑Context clustering).**
`Local‑Sense λ clusters {σᵢ} ⊢ ∀i: context(σᵢ)=context(λ)`
*Reading:* No Cross‑context items inside a Local‑Sense (F.3).

**SCR‑F15‑S4 (Two registers).**
`Local‑Sense λ ⊢ label(λ)=⟨tech,plain, symbol?⟩ ∧ plain≠∅ ∧ tech≠∅`
*Reading:* Both engineering and plain labels exist; symbol (if any) is purely informative (F.2/F.3/F.5).

**SCR‑F15‑S5 (Minimal gloss).**
`gloss(λ) framed at minimal necessary generality`
*Reading:* The gloss neither smuggles behaviour/deontics nor globalises the sense (F.2/F.5).

**SCR‑F15‑S6 (Context‑local normal form).**
`normalize_C(surface)=n ⊢ n used only within C`
*Reading:* No global normal form at this stage (F.2).

---

## 9 · SCR — Static conformance rules (S‑Cross)

> S‑Cross rules tie Contexts, rows, Role Descriptions, bridges, and windows together **without** breaking locality.

**SCR-F15-S7 (Single-cell Role Description).**
`Role Description τ ⊢ anchor(τ)=one SenseCell ⟨C,λ⟩`
*Reading:* Every Role Description points to exactly **one** SenseCell; no mixed semantics (F.4).

**SCR-F15-S8 (Name discipline).**
`Role Description τ ⊢ name(τ) obeys F.5`
*Reading:* Labels follow the agreed morphology, register pairing, and minimal generality (F.5).

**SCR‑F15‑S9 (Row sufficiency).**
`Row ρ lists cells {⟨Cᵢ,λᵢ⟩} ⊢ |distinct(Cᵢ)| ≥ 2`
*Reading:* A row is meaningful only if it spans **at least two Contexts** (F.7).

**SCR‑F15‑S10 (Row purity).**
`Row ρ ⊢ no cell contains Cross‑context clustering`
*Reading:* Each cell is a **single** SenseCell, not a pre‑merged bundle (F.7).

**SCR‑F15‑S11 (Reuse before mint).**
`Proposed row ρ' overlaps intent(ρ) ⊢ prefer reuse(ρ) ∨ document F.8 decision`
*Reading:* Rows are reused by default; new rows require a mint‑or‑reuse rationale (F.7–F.8).

**SCR‑F15‑S12 (Bridge is explicit).**
`C₁≠C₂ ∧ relation asserted between λ₁,λ₂ ⊢ Bridge β: ⟨⟨C₁,λ₁⟩ ↔ ⟨C₂,λ₂⟩, kind, CL, loss⟩`
*Reading:* Cross‑context relations appear **only** as Bridges with declared kind (≡, ⊑, ⊒, ⟂), Congruence Level, and loss notes (F.9; B.3 for CL semantics).

**SCR‑F15‑S13 (Bridge locality).**
`Bridge β ⊢ cells belong to different Contexts`
*Reading:* You never bridge **within** a Context; that’s clustering (F.3/F.9).

**SCR‑F15‑S14 (Window honesty).**
`Status family Σ varies by time/scale ⊢ windows(Σ) define variation; no new Status types introduced`
*Reading:* Temporal and scale variation appears as **windows**, not as new types (F.10).

**SCR-F15-S15 (SoD preservation).**
`Bundle B = {τ₁,τ₂,…} with SoD(τᵢ ⟂ τⱼ) ⊢ no single **Role Description** fuses τᵢ,τⱼ`
*Reading:* Separation‑of‑Duties is a **normative constraint**, not a label tweak (F.14).

**SCR‑F15‑S16 (Binding coherence).**
`Service‑Acceptance binding references Status Σ and Execution E ⊢ Σ anchored; E anchored; comparison defined via Bridge(s) if Cross‑context`
*Reading:* Acceptance compares **anchored** executions and statuses, with any Cross‑context step made explicit (F.12 + F.9).

## 10 · Judgement schemas (core moves)

> Representative mental moves; each “fires” one cluster of SCRs.

1. **Anchoring**
   `Seed σ : context C, C ∈ Contexts(L) ⊢ anchored(σ)`  *(S1)*

2. **Local clustering**
   `∀σ∈Σ: context(σ)=C ⊢ cluster_C(Σ) = Local‑Sense λ`  *(S3)*

3. **Role-Description anchoring**
   `Role Description τ names ⟨C,λ⟩ ⊢ singleCell(τ)`  *(S7)*

4. **Row reuse**
   `intent(ρ') ≈ intent(ρ) ⊢ reuse(ρ) ∨ justify_mint(ρ')`  *(S11)*

5. **Bridge assertion**
   `C₁≠C₂ ∧ compare(⟨C₁,λ₁⟩,⟨C₂,λ₂⟩) ⊢ Bridge(CL,kind,loss)`  *(S12–S13)*

6. **Windowing**
   `Status Σ exhibits temporal/scale variance ⊢ define windows(Σ); forbid Σ‑splitting`  *(S14)*

7. **SoD guard**
  `SoD(τᵢ ⟂ τⱼ) ⊢ ¬exists Role Description υ that conflates {τᵢ,τⱼ}`  *(S15)*

---

## 11 · Micro‑witnesses (illustrative)

**11.1 Activity vs Task (PROV‑O ↔ IEC 61131‑3).**
Contexts: `PROV‑O (run)`, `IEC 61131‑3 (run)`.
Local‑Senses: *activity(prov)*, *task(iec)*.
*Fire:* S7 (**Role Description** “Execution” points to **one SenseCell**), S12 (Bridge: **overlap**, CL=2, loss: *IEC task may be cyclic; PROV activity need not be periodic*), S13 (Contexts differ), S14 (Status windows for compliance later, not new types).

**11.2 Service Acceptance (ITIL 4 ↔ SOSA/SSN).**
Contexts: `ITIL 4 (design)`, `SOSA/SSN (run)`.
Row: **Service‑Availability** with cells ⟨ITIL\:SLO availability⟩, ⟨SOSA\:observation of uptime⟩.
*Fire:* S9 (row spans ≥2 Contexts), S12 (Bridge kind: *measure-for-target*, CL=3, loss: *sampling bias*), S16 (binding coherence), **S-RoleDesc-SingleCell**.



---

## 12 · Relations (with other patterns)

**Builds on:** E.10.D1 (Context semantics), F.1–F.14.
**Constrains:** Any addition to F.1–F.14 is **publish‑ready** only if all relevant **SCR** here evaluate **true** on its slice.
**Feed:** B.3 may use Bridge CL and loss notes to adjust assurance.

## 13 · RSCR — Regression & Stability Rules (R‑Evo)

> These rules speak about **changes over time**. They are expressed as **judgement schemas** that compare two conceptual snapshots: `@t0` and `@t1`. No storage, no workflows—just content assertions.

**Notation.**
`X@t0` — object X before change • `X@t1` — after change • `Δ(X)=⟨…⟩` — described difference • `same(…) / new(…) / retired(…)` — conceptual status.

---

### 13.1 Contexts & editions

**RSCR‑F15‑E1 (No silent replacement).**
`Context C@t0 : edition e0, C@t1 : edition e1, e1≠e0 ⊢ either newContext(C,e1) ∨ explicitRecency(C,e1)`
*Reading:* A new edition becomes a **new Context** if sense shifts; otherwise keep one context and mark recency. Never overwrite meaning.

**RSCR‑F15‑E2 (Trip‑wire carry‑over).**
`C@t1 derives from C@t0 ⊢ tripWires(C@t1) ⊇ review(tripWires(C@t0))`
*Reading:* Known confusions are re‑checked and re‑stated (or explicitly dropped with a sentence why).

---

### 13.2 Local‑Senses & SenseCells

**RSCR‑F15‑E3 (Reconstitutable seeds).**
`Local‑Sense λ@t0, Δ(occurrences) → λ@t1 ⊢ λ@t1 still reconstructible from attestations@t1`
*Reading:* After changes in attestations, the Local‑Sense remains **auditably rebuildable**.

**RSCR‑F15‑E4 (No Cross‑context creep).**
`SenseCell ⟨C,λ⟩@t0 → @t1 ⊢ context(λ@t1)=C`
*Reading:* A SenseCell never migrates across Contexts through edits.

---

### 13.3 Concept‑Set rows

**RSCR‑F15‑E5 (Row identity).**
`Row ρ@t0 with cells {⟨Cᵢ,λᵢ⟩} → ρ@t1 with {⟨Cᵢ,λᵢ'⟩} ⊢ ρ “same” iff intent(λᵢ')≈intent(λᵢ) ∀i`
*Reading:* A row is the **same** row only if each cell still means *the same thing* in its Context. Otherwise, mint a **new row** and retire the old (F.7–F.8).

**RSCR‑F15‑E6 (Row shrink‑before‑split).**
`ρ@t1 loses a cell due to edition split ⊢ prefer keep ρ@t0 + add new row ρ' rather than mutating ρ silently`
*Reading:* When a Context splits meaning, preserve history: **add** instead of rewriting.

---

### 13.4 Role Descriptions (Role/Status)

**RSCR-F15-E7 (Single-cell continuity).**
`Role Description τ@t0 → τ@t1 ⊢ anchor(τ@t1)=one SenseCell ∧ (sameCell ∨ justifiedSwitch)`
*Reading:* A **Role Description** keeps pointing to **one** SenseCell; switching cells requires a **one-sentence** rationale tied to the row you reuse (F.4, F.8).

**RSCR-F15-E8 (Alias-then-rename).**
`name(τ@t0) → name(τ@t1) ⊢ create alias(name@t0→name@t1) unless semantics changed`
*Reading:* If only the **name** improves, create an **Alias** (F.13). If semantics change, **mint a new Role Description** instead.

---

### 13.5 Bridges

**RSCR‑F15‑E9 (Re‑validate on movement).**
`Bridge β: ⟨⟨C₁,λ₁⟩ ↔ ⟨C₂,λ₂⟩, CL, loss⟩ @t0; any λᵢ mutates @t1 ⊢ β re‑examined; CL may drop; loss updated`
*Reading:* Any end‑cell change **forces** a fresh look; default is **more caution** (CL non‑increasing unless newly justified).

**RSCR‑F15‑E10 (No bridge drift to identity).**
`series of edits turns β(kind≠≡) → β(kind=≡) ⊢ require new witness set`
*Reading:* Equivalence (≡) is special: it needs a **fresh witness**; you cannot slide into ≡ by minor edits.

---

### 13.6 Status windows & SoD

**RSCR‑F15‑E11 (Window stability).**
`Status family Σ windows@t0 → @t1 ⊢ window set changes only if variance‑of‑meaning is shown`
*Reading:* Add or remove windows **only** when meaning genuinely varies across time/scale—never for convenience (F.10).

**RSCR‑F15‑E12 (SoD invariance).**
`SoD(τᵢ ⟂ τⱼ) @t0 → @t1 ⊢ SoD preserved; no new Role Description conflates τᵢ,τⱼ`
*Reading:* Separation‑of‑Duties remains in force through changes (F.14).

---

## 14 · Anti‑patterns the harness catches (and the fix)

| Code   | Anti‑pattern            | Symptom                                  | Why it breaks                         | Harness catch → Fix                                                                              |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **H1** | **Row‑of‑one**          | Row spans a single Context                  | No cross‑projection; fake unification | **S9** fails → either add the second cell or drop the row                                        |
| **H2** | **Bridge‑by‑name**      | “Same name” assumed across Contexts         | Imports meaning; hides loss           | **S12** missing → assert an explicit Bridge with CL+loss or withdraw the claim                   |
| **H3** | **Silent edition swap** | “BPMN” changed to 2.0 → 2.1 without note | Retcons past statements               | **E1** fails → mint a new Context or mark recency; never overwrite                                  |
| **H4** | **Locality blur**       | Local‑Sense mixes two Contexts              | Cross‑context clustering                 | **S3/S6** fail → split back by Context; keep per‑Context normal forms                                  |
| **H5** | **Window‑as‑type**      | New Status type for weekend vs weekday   | Type inflation; hides time stance     | **S14/E11** fail → represent as windows, not types                                               |
| **H6** | **SoD bypass**          | Bundle fuses mutually exclusive roles    | Hidden duty conflict                  | **S15/E12** fail → keep roles separate; use Bundle only as reuse map                             |
| **H7** | **Alias-as-merge**      | Alias used to smuggle semantic change    | Loses history; misleads readers       | **E8** fails → if semantics changed, mint new Role Description; keep old with alias note only for pure rename |
| **H8** | **CL optimism**         | Most Bridges set to high CL by default   | Over‑trust; brittle reuse             | **E9/E10** → demand witnesses; prefer conservative CL                                            |

---

## 15 · Worked “dry‑runs” (composite slices)

> Each dry‑run shows **how the checks fire** when something evolves. These are **thinking rehearsals**, not procedures.

### 15.1 New edition of ITIL (services) arrives

**Slice.** Contexts: ITIL 4(2020)@t0 → ITIL 4(2024)@t1; Row: *Service-Availability*; **Role Description**: `AvailabilityStatus`; Bridges: to SOSA/SSN observations.

**Fire.**
E1 (**no silent replacement**): decide **new Context** ITIL 4(2024) because SLO definitions narrowed.
E5 (**row identity**): row *Service‑Availability*@t1 **new** (cells now ⟨ITIL2024\:SLO⟩ + ⟨SOSA\:obs⟩). Retire old row with note.
E9 (**bridge re‑validate**): sampling assumptions changed → **lower CL** by one and update loss note (*new calc window*).
E7 (**single-cell Role Description**): `AvailabilityStatus` still points to exactly one cell (ITIL2024\:SLO). Name unchanged → **no alias** needed.

**Pay‑off.** History is preserved; reuse remains safe; acceptance bindings (F.12) still compare anchored things.

---

### 15.2 Rename a Role Description without changing meaning

**Slice.** **Role Description** `IncidentStatus`@t0 → `ServiceIncidentStatus`@t1; same SenseCell.

**Fire.**
E8 (**alias‑then‑rename**): create **Alias** `IncidentStatus → ServiceIncidentStatus` (F.13).
S8 (**name discipline**): new name fits the suffix rules (F.5).

**Pay‑off.** Readers find both names; semantics untouched.

---

### 15.3 Tighten a Bridge (weak overlap → equivalence)

**Slice.** Bridge β between ⟨OWL\:subclass⟩ and ⟨FCA\:order‑edge⟩ was *overlap, CL=2*. New formal result proves equivalence in the covered fragment.

**Fire.**
E10 (**no drift to identity**): to move from overlap→≡, present a **new witness set** (fragment constraints).
S12 (**bridge explicit**): update β(kind=≡, CL=3) with precise scope/loss (“only within acyclic concept lattices with…”)

**Pay‑off.** Equivalence is **scoped and auditable**, not hand‑waved.

---

### 15.4 Window misuse detected

**Slice.** Team proposes *PeakHoursAvailabilityStatus* as a new Status type.

**Fire.**
S14/E11 (**window honesty**): reject new type; define a **window** for *peak hours* on `AvailabilityStatus`.

**Pay‑off.** No type explosion; the evaluation logic in F.12 stays uniform.

---

## 16 · Migration cues (conceptual)

1. **When in doubt, fork—not overwrite.** New edition? **Add a Context** unless you can argue sense identity in one sentence.
2. **Name pain → aliases, not merges.** If a label confuses, **rename with an alias**; if meaning changed, **mint new**.
3. **Rows age gracefully.** Never retrofit a row; **retire and re‑row** when any cell’s sense shifts.
4. **Bridges get colder over time.** Prefer to **lower CL** when editions drift; raising CL needs fresh witnesses.
5. **Windows absorb variation.** Resist splitting Status types; **window** by time/scale/phase.
6. **Guard SoD early.** When binding composite responsibilities (F.14), check SoD before naming.
7. **Teach the delta.** When things evolve, write one‑breath deltas (“what changed, why it matters”) as part of the example narrative—no registries implied.

---

## 17 · Acceptance summary (“Harness green”)

A unification slice is **publish‑ready** when:

1. **All SCR (S‑Local & S‑Cross) hold** for the current snapshot (Contexts, Local‑Senses, SenseCells, rows, Role Descriptions, Bridges, windows).
2. **All RSCR (R‑Evo) hold** against the previous snapshot: no silent replacements; rows either unchanged or retired+reborn; Bridges re‑validated with CL non‑inflated without witnesses; windows adjusted only for real variance; SoD intact.
3. **One micro‑witness per moving part** exists in the text (tiny example showing the check in action).
4. **Memory rule still holds**: the active Context set for the line fits in a careful mind without external aids (F.1).

---

## 18 · Didactic distillation (90‑second teaching script)

> “Use the harness to **think like a safety net**. First, the **SCR** threads: everything is **local** to a Context; **Role Descriptions** point to **one** SenseCell; rows actually **cross** Contexts; Bridges are explicit with CL and a loss note; windows capture variation without spawning new types. Then, the **RSCR** knots: never overwrite an edition—**fork the Context** or mark recency; keep rows stable by **retiring and re-rowing**; Bridges get **re-validated** (CL goes down unless you bring proof); renames become **aliases** unless meaning changes; **windows** absorb time/scale shifts; **SoD** stays intact. If you can pass these thoughts on a small slice—and explain each pass in **one breath**—your unification is green. No tooling, no roles, no dashboards. Just clean Contexts, honest rows, cautious bridges, and names that help minds meet.”

# F.16 — Worked‑Example Template (Cross‑Domain) \[A] 

**“Show the thought, not the tooling.”**
**Status.** Architectural pattern \[A], architheory‑agnostic.
**Builds on:** E.10.D1 **Lexical Discipline for “Context” (D.CTX)**; F.1–F.15.
**Coordinates with.** B.3 **Trust & Assurance Calculus** (CL on Bridges); Part C architheories (Sys‑CAL, KD‑CAL, Kind-CAL, Method‑CAL).

---

## 1 · Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **single, didactic page template** for cross‑domain worked examples that makes every claim **local to a Context** (Context), every Cross‑context step **explicit via a Bridge**, and every named role/status **traceably tied** to one **SenseCell**. The template is **notation‑free** and **tool‑agnostic**; it captures **how to think** the example so others can replay it.

**Applicability.** Use whenever you illustrate **any** FPF construct that spans more than one Context: **Role Assignment & Enactment** bindings, acceptance checks, measurement-driven claims, type alignment, control/actuation stories, etc.

**Non‑goals.** No registries, workflows, editors, or storage formats; no step‑by‑step “team procedures.” This pattern shapes **the page a reader sees**, not how it was produced.

---

## 2 · Problem frame

Cross‑domain examples often fail in four predictable ways:

1. **Global words.** *Process*, *role*, *service*, *execution* used without the Context, inviting drift.
2. **Hidden bridges.** “It’s basically the same” across disciplines, with losses left implicit.
3. **Name without sense.** A **Role Description** name appears with no visible tie to a SenseCell.
4. **List without structure.** Facts line up but never meet in a single **Concept‑Set row**.

The template counters these by forcing **Contexts → senses → row → bridges**, in that order.

---

## 3 · Core idea (didactic)

A robust worked example is a **compact theatre**:

* **Stage** = a declared **unification line** (which threads of Part C are in play).
* **Backdrop** = **Context set** (Contexts from F.1), each with a one‑line Card.
* **Actors** = **SenseCells** (⟨Context, Local‑Sense⟩) you will actually use.
* **Plot** = **one Concept‑Set row** where those cells stand as “the same thing” for this example.
* **Cues** = **Role Descriptions** that reference exactly one SenseCell each.
* **Cross‑talk** = **Bridges** across Contexts (with kind, CL, and loss).
* **Timing** = **Windows** (if status varies across time/scale) and **SoD** (if duties must remain separate).
* **Moral** = a handful of **harness checks** (F.15) that the reader can verify mentally.

---

## 4 · Minimal vocabulary (this pattern only)

* **Context / Context** — always **U.BoundedContext** (E.10.D1).
* **Local‑Sense** — a sense clustered within one context (F.3).
* **SenseCell** — address `⟨Context, Local‑Sense⟩`.
* **Concept‑Set row (ρ)** — a Cross‑context alignment for “what we treat as one” in this example (F.7/F.8).
* **Role Description (τ)** — a Role or Status that **points to one SenseCell** (F.4–F.6).
* **Bridge (β)** — explicit Cross‑context relation with **kind** (≡ / overlaps / broader‑than / narrower‑than), **CL**, and **loss note** (F.9).
* **Window** — a bounded interval (time/scale/phase) tied to a Status (F.10).
* **SoD** — Separation-of-Duties constraint among **Roles** (F.14).

---

## 5 · The one‑page **Worked‑Example Canvas**

> Each bullet is a **thought you make visible**, not a form field.

1. **Title & claim.** A short name + one‑sentence claim you will demonstrate.
   *Example:* *“Service Uptime as Evaluated by Runtime Executions”* — “We compare **Execution (IEC)** observations to **SLO (ITIL)** within a declared window.”

2. **Unification line.** Which Part C threads are active.
   *Example:* *Enactment + KD‑CAL (sensing) + Sys‑CAL (execution).*

3. **Context set (compact Cards).** 3–6 Contexts from F.1 with one‑line scope and, if inherent, **design vs run** stance.
   *Example:* *BPMN 2.0 (design: workflow graph); PROV‑O (run: Activity uses/generates); ITIL 4 (design: SLO/SLA); SOSA/SSN (run: Observation); IEC 61131‑3 (run: task executes).*

4. **SenseCells in play.** List exactly the **Local‑Senses** you will use, each prefixed by its Context.
   *Example:* ⟨**ITIL**: service‑level‑objective⟩, ⟨**SOSA**: observation⟩, ⟨**IEC**: execution‑task⟩, ⟨**PROV**: activity⟩.

5. **The Concept‑Set row (ρ).** A **single line** that places the cells you treat as “the same” for the claim, with a one‑breath justification.
   *Example row ρ:* { ⟨ITIL\:SLO⟩ ↔ ⟨SOSA\:observed‑availability⟩ } — *We treat “target availability” and “observed availability” as comparable magnitudes in a specific window.*

6. **Bridges (β).** For any Cross‑context relation **not captured by ρ** (or that requires nuance), state **kind, CL, loss**.
   *Example β₁:* ⟨**IEC\:execution‑task**⟩ **overlaps** ⟨**PROV\:activity**⟩, **CL=2**, *loss:* PROV lacks cyclic scheduling semantics.
   *Example β₂:* ⟨**SOSA\:observation**⟩ **narrower‑than** ⟨**ITIL\:measurement**⟩, **CL=2**, *loss:* ITIL omits procedure metadata.

7. **Role-Description hooks.** Name the Role/Status templates and the **one SenseCell** each references.
   *Example:* `AvailabilityStatus` → ⟨ITIL\:SLO⟩; `Execution` → ⟨IEC\:execution‑task⟩; `EvidenceObservation` → ⟨SOSA\:observation⟩.

8. **Windows & SoD (if relevant).** Spell any **status windows** and any **SoD** you rely on.
   *Example:* Window: *monthly, business‑hours*; SoD: *Operator* ⟂ *SLO‑Owner*.

9. **Micro‑narrative (5–7 lines).** Walk the reader through the claim using **Context‑prefixed words** and the row/bridges above.
   *Example (abridged):* “A **task (IEC)** runs the control program. Its **observations (SOSA)** yield availability over the *monthly* window. We compare those to the **SLO (ITIL)** in the same window. Where we refer to **activity (PROV)** we do so via **β₁** (overlap, CL=2). The row ρ is the locus of comparison; the Bridge **β₂** explains why ‘measurement’ in ITIL is broader than ‘observation’ in SOSA.”

**Harness pings (F.15).** *S-Row-Cross*, **S-RoleDesc-SingleCell**, *E-NoSilentEdition*.
    *Example:* *S‑Row‑Cross*, *S‑RoleDescription‑SingleCell*, *E‑NoSilentEdition*.

> **Memory rule.** If your Canvas cannot fit on a single page (or one slide), the example is teaching the wrong thing.

---

## 6 · Invariants (normative)

1. **Locality of meaning.** Every term in the narrative appears **with its Context** at first mention (*process (BPMN)*, *activity (PROV)*, …).
2. **At least one row.** The example **MUST** include ≥ 1 **Concept‑Set row** spanning ≥ 2 Contexts.
3. **Single-cell Role Description.** Every **Role Description** in the example **MUST** point to **one** SenseCell.
4. **Explicit bridges.** Any Cross‑context step **not explained by the row** **MUST** appear as a **Bridge** with kind, CL, and loss.
5. **Temporal honesty.** If a Context fixes **design vs run**, the narrative respects it.
6. **Window discipline.** If comparison depends on time/scale/phase, a **window** is stated rather than minting a new Status type.
7. **SoD integrity.** If duties are involved, **SoD** is explicit and unbroken.
8. **Didactic parsimony.** One page, one claim, one row (or a tiny bundle of closely related rows).

---

## 7 · The row panel (how to show it without notation)

Show the row as a **compact two‑to‑five‑column list**:

* **Column header** = Context.
* **Cell** = `Local‑Sense label` (tech register; optional plain label on next line).
* **Footline** (one line) = “row reason”—why these cells count as “the same thing **for this claim**.”

*Example visual (linear text):*
**ITIL 4:** *service‑level‑objective* | **SOSA/SSN:** *observed‑availability* → **Row reason:** *both quantify availability for the same window; units harmonised by KD‑CAL; procedural metadata differs (captured in loss of β₂).*

---

## 8 · Worked micro‑example (didactic)

> **Title.** *Alarms Should Not Satisfy Uptime*
> **Claim.** An **alarm‑only Execution (IEC)** cannot satisfy the **SLO (ITIL)** because **observation (SOSA)** windows exclude time in “alarm state.”

**Contexts.** IEC 61131‑3 (run), SOSA/SSN (run), ITIL 4 (design).
**SenseCells.** ⟨IEC\:execution‑task⟩, ⟨SOSA\:observation⟩, ⟨ITIL\:SLO⟩.
**Row ρ.** { ⟨ITIL\:uptime‑SLO⟩ ↔ ⟨SOSA\:observed‑availability⟩ } — comparable magnitudes in the *calendar‑month* window.
**Bridge β.** ⟨IEC\:alarm‑state⟩ **narrower‑than** ⟨SOSA\:observation‑qualifier⟩, **CL=2**, *loss:* SOSA does not prescribe plant‑specific alarm semantics.
**Role-Description hooks.** `AvailabilityStatus` → ⟨ITIL\:SLO⟩; `EvidenceObservation` → ⟨SOSA\:observation⟩.
**Window.** *Calendar month, business‑hours*, exclusion: *alarm‑state intervals*.
**Micro‑narrative (4 lines).** A **task (IEC)** runs; when the plant is in **alarm state**, **observations (SOSA)** are flagged and **excluded** from the availability window. We then compare the remaining interval to the **SLO (ITIL)** via row ρ. The Bridge β clarifies why the flag is a **qualifier** in SOSA, not a Status type in ITIL.
**Harness pings.** *S‑Row‑Cross*, *S‑RoleDescr‑SingleCell*, *S‑Window*, *S‑TemporalHonesty*.

---

## 9 · Relations (with other patterns)

**Builds on:**
F.1 (Contexts), F.2–F.3 (terms & senses), F.4–F.6 (roles), F.7–F.8 (rows), F.9 (bridges), F.10 (windows), F.14 (SoD), F.15 (harness).

**Constrains:**
Any example placed in Part C or Part B **must** render its claim through this canvas (or a faithful reduction), so readers can run F.15 mentally.

## 10 · Didactic distillation (60‑second script)

> “A good cross‑domain example fits on **one page**. First, name the **claim**. Then show the **Contexts** you’re using. List the **SenseCells** you will actually touch. Draw **one row** that makes them the same **for this claim**. Every Cross‑context nuance you can’t justify in that row becomes a **Bridge** with a **kind**, a **CL**, and a **loss** sentence. Point each **Role Description** to **one** cell. If time/scale matters, state the **window**; if duties matter, state **SoD**. Finish with two or three **harness pings** from F.15. That’s it—no tooling, no long procedures. The reader can now replay your thought and agree (or disagree) at the right place.”

## 11 · Anti‑patterns & remedies

| #         | Anti‑pattern               | Symptom in the page                                            | Why it breaks thinking                                         | Remedy (point to this template & sibling patterns)                        |
| --------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AP‑1**  | **Row‑less tour**          | A list of facts from many Contexts with no **Concept‑Set row**.   | Reader cannot see *what is treated as the same* for the claim. | Include **≥ 1 row ρ** spanning ≥ 2 Contexts (§5‑5, §6‑2).                    |
| **AP‑2**  | **Stealth bridging**       | Phrases like “basically the same” with no Bridge.              | Imports meaning Cross‑context; hides losses.                      | State a **Bridge β** with **kind, CL, loss** (§5‑6, F.9).                 |
| **AP-3**  | **Role-Description vagueness**          | A Role/Status named without a SenseCell.                       | Why it breaks thinking                                         | Remedy (point to this template & sibling patterns)                        |
| **AP‑4**  | **Global words**           | *process, role, service* appear unprefixed.                    | Context‑less words drift mid‑example.                             | Prefix first mention with the **Context** (*process (BPMN)*) (§6‑1, E.10.D1). |
| **AP‑5**  | **Window‑free comparison** | Numbers/targets compared with no stated window.                | Apples‑to‑oranges across time/scale.                           | Declare a **Window** for the Status (§5‑8, F.10).                         |
| **AP‑6**  | **SoD leakage**            | Duties named but the same actor implicitly holds both.         | Violates Separation‑of‑Duties intent.                          | State **SoD** and keep duties disjoint (§5‑8, F.14).                      |
| **AP‑7**  | **Design/run blur**        | A design‑time notion used as if it were a run‑time occurrence. | Category error; wrong Context claims.                             | Mark Context stance and keep claims in‑stance (§5‑3, §6‑5).                  |
| **AP‑8**  | **Edition haze**           | “BPMN”, “ITIL” without edition/profile.                        | Debates about “what the book says”.                            | Put **name + edition** on each Card (§5‑3).                               |
| **AP‑9**  | **CL silence**             | Bridge kind given, no CL or loss note.                         | Reader cannot gauge translation risk.                          | Add **CL** and **loss** in every Bridge (§5‑6, B.3).                      |
| **AP‑10** | **Over‑row**               | Ten cells glued into one row “for convenience”.                | Collapses distinct senses; unreadable.                         | Prefer **one tight row**; split into **two rows** if needed (§5‑5, §8).   |

## 12 · Extended worked micro‑examples

> Each example fits the **one‑page canvas** (§5) and makes the **row** and **bridges** do the work.

### 12.1 Type alignment: OWL class vs FCA concept (design‑time only)

**Title & claim.** *“Two Lenses on *Pump*: OWL class and FCA concept align for catalogue reasoning.”*
**Unification line.** Kind-CAL (design) + FCA (design).
**Contexts.** **OWL 2 (profiles)** — classes, `subClassOf` (design). **FCA corpus** — formal concepts, lattice order (design).
**SenseCells.** ⟨OWL\:class ‘Pump’⟩, ⟨FCA\:formal‑concept ‘Pump’⟩.
**Row ρ.** { ⟨OWL\:Pump⟩ ↔ ⟨FCA\:Pump⟩ } — *same practical extension in this product catalogue*.
**Bridge β.** ⟨FCA\:lattice‑order⟩ **overlaps** ⟨OWL\:subclass‑order⟩, **CL=2**, *loss:* FCA intents may include context attributes not modeled in OWL restrictions.
**Role-Description hooks.** `TypeLabel` → ⟨OWL\:class⟩ (for naming), no runtime **Role Assignment/Enactment**.
**Micro‑narrative (3 lines).** For catalogue queries, the **instances** covered by OWL class *Pump* match those of the FCA concept created from the same attributes; we treat them as one row. The **orderings** diverge in nuance (β), but not for membership in this example.
**Harness pings.** *S‑Row‑Cross*, *S‑TemporalHonesty* (design only), *S‑Bridge‑Kind‑CL*.

---

### 12.2 Role vs permission: SoD in enactment vs access control

**Title & claim.** *“Behavioral role (BPMN) is disjoint from access role (RBAC); keep duties separate.”*
**Unification line.** Role Assignmnent and Enactment (design & run) + access/deontics (design).
**Contexts.** **BPMN 2.0** — participant/lanes (design). **NIST RBAC (2004)** — roles/permissions (design).
**SenseCells.** ⟨BPMN\:participant⟩, ⟨RBAC\:role⟩.
**Row ρ.** — *(intentionally none)* — we do **not** treat them as the same.
**Bridge β.** ⟨BPMN\:participant⟩ **disjoint** ⟨RBAC\:role⟩, **CL=3**, *loss:* none—*different dimensions* (behavioral mask vs permission grouping).
**Role-Description hooks.** `Operator` → ⟨BPMN\:participant⟩; `AccessRole` → ⟨RBAC\:role⟩. **SoD:** `Operator` ⟂ `AccessRole‑Admin`.
**Window.** Not applicable.
**Micro‑narrative (3 lines).** We show SoD by prohibiting the same actor from holding **Operator** and **AccessRole‑Admin**. The disjoint **β** prevents leakage between behavioral masks and permission bundles.
**Harness pings.** *S‑RoleDescr‑SingleCell*, *S‑SoD*, *S‑Bridge‑Disjoint*.

---

### 12.3 Method quartet: from MethodDescription to Work with observations

**Title & claim.** *“Behavioral role (BPMN) is disjoint from access role (RBAC); keep duties separate.”*
**Unification line.** **Role Assignment & Enactment** (design & run) + access/deontics (design).
**Contexts.** **SPEM 2.0** (design: Method/MethodDescription), **PROV‑O** (run: Activity), **SOSA/SSN** (run: Observation), **ITIL 4** (design: SLO).
**SenseCells.** ⟨SPEM\:MethodDescription⟩, ⟨PROV\:activity⟩, ⟨SOSA\:observation⟩, ⟨ITIL\:SLO⟩.
**Row ρ.** { ⟨ITIL\:SLO\:build‑time⟩ ↔ ⟨SOSA\:observed‑build‑duration⟩ } — *compare promised vs observed duration on the same window*.
**Bridges.** β₁: ⟨SPEM\:MethodDescription⟩ **narrower‑than** ⟨PROV\:activity‑plan⟩, **CL=2**, *loss:* PROV lacks prescriptive structure; β₂: ⟨SOSA\:observation⟩ **narrower‑than** ⟨ITIL\:measurement⟩, **CL=2**, *loss:* ITIL abstracts from procedure.
**Role-Description hooks.** `Operator` → ⟨BPMN\:participant⟩; `AccessRole` → ⟨RBAC\:role⟩. **SoD:** `Operator` ⟂ `AccessRole-Admin`.
**Window.** *Release window: calendar week*.
**Micro‑narrative (4 lines).** The **MethodDescription (SPEM)** implies a target **build‑time**; **Work (PROV activity)** occurs; **observations (SOSA)** provide actuals; we compare against the **SLO (ITIL)** via row ρ over the *calendar week* window. Bridges β₁–β₂ explain why plan/measure semantics do not collapse.
**Harness pings.** *S‑Row‑Cross*, *S‑Window*, *S‑RoleDesc‑SingleCell*, *S‑TemporalHonesty*.

## 13 · Reasoning primitives (judgement schemas)

> These are **mental checks** you can perform on any example page.

1. **Row validity**
   `cells(ρ) = {⟨Cᵢ,Sᵢ⟩} with |Contexts(ρ)| ≥ 2 ⊢ validRow(ρ)`
   *Reading:* A row is valid only if it spans at least two Contexts and all entries are legitimate **SenseCells** (from F.3).

2. **Bridge coverage**
   `coRef(Ca,Cb) ∧ ¬sameRow(Ca,Cb) ⊢ requires β(Ca↔Cb)`
   *Reading:* If two Contexts are co‑referenced in the narrative but their senses are not placed in the same row, an explicit **Bridge** is needed.

3. **Role-Description single-cell**
   `Role Description τ used ⊢ ∃!⟨C,S⟩ : ref(τ)=⟨C,S⟩`

4. **Window sufficiency**
   `compare(qᵢ@Cᵢ, qⱼ@Cⱼ) ⊢ windowDeclared`
   *Reading:* Any Cross‑context quantitative comparison calls for a stated **Window**.

5. **Temporal honesty**
   `C has stance s ∈ {design, run} ⊢ claims@C must respect s`
   *Reading:* Do not assert run‑facts in a design‑only Context, or vice versa.

6. **SoD integrity**
   `SoD(D₁ ⟂ D₂) ∧ assign(actor, D₁) ∧ assign(actor, D₂) ⊢ violation`
   *Reading:* A declared SoD cannot be violated inside the example.

7. **Bridge clarity**
   `β given ⊢ kind(β) ∧ CL(β) ∧ loss(β)`
   *Reading:* Every Bridge shows **kind**, **CL**, and a **one‑line loss**.

8. **Edition clarity**
   `card(C) ⊢ has(name, edition)`
   *Reading:* Each Context Card specifies name + edition/profile.

9. **Harness ping mapping**
   `ping ∈ {S‑*, E‑*} ⊢ ping ⇒ subset of judgements above`
   *Reading:* Each named harness check (F.15) has a clear reading in these judgements.

---

## 14 · Acceptance tests (SCR/RSCR)

### 14.1 Static conformance (SCR)

* **SCR‑F16‑S01 (Row present).** The page contains **≥ 1** Concept‑Set row spanning **≥ 2 Contexts**.
* **SCR‑F16‑S02 (Bridge explicit).** Every Cross‑context assertion not justified by a row is shown as a **Bridge** with **kind, CL, loss**.
* **SCR-F16-S03 (Role-Description anchoring).** Each **Role Description** appearing in the page references **exactly one SenseCell**.
* **SCR‑F16‑S04 (Context prefixes).** First mention of each ambiguous term is **Context‑prefixed**.
* **SCR‑F16‑S05 (Window discipline).** Any numeric comparison across Contexts names a **Window**.
* **SCR‑F16‑S06 (Temporal stance).** Claims respect each Context’s **design/run** stance.
* **SCR‑F16‑S07 (SoD).** If duties are named and SoD is relevant, **SoD is stated** and unviolated.
* **SCR‑F16‑S08 (One‑page parsimony).** The example fits the **one‑page canvas**; if extended, each sub‑page still respects §6 invariants.

### 14.2 Regression (RSCR)

* **RSCR‑F16‑E01 (Edition drift).** When a Context’s edition changes, the example either (a) is unaffected or (b) adds a note adjusting **β** or the **row**; no silent rewrites.
* **RSCR‑F16‑E02 (Bridge re‑score).** If an upstream **CL** definition changes (B.3), affected Bridges on the page show the new CL and, if needed, an updated **loss** sentence.
* **RSCR‑F16‑E03 (Row resilience).** If a SenseCell is split in F.3 (sense refinement), the example either keeps the same row using one child sense, or splits into two rows with a short justification.
* **RSCR‑F16‑E04 (Window clarity).** If organisational cadence changes (e.g., from monthly to weekly), windows on the page are updated explicitly.

---

## 15 · Migration notes (conceptual)

1. **Refactor long tutorials.** Extract the **claim**; pick **3–6 Contexts** (Cards); list the **SenseCells** you actually use; craft **one tight row**; surface any cross‑talk as **Bridges** with loss notes; delete everything else.
2. **Split crowded rows.** If a row tries to carry more than \~4 cells, split into two rows and write a **one‑line purpose** for each.
3. **Stabilise vocabulary.** If you find yourself rewriting terms mid‑page, you likely forgot a Context; return to F.1 and add a Card.
4. **Teach the bridge itch.** Leave “*these are the same*” feelings ungratified until you can articulate **kind, CL, loss** in one sentence.
5. **Stay in stance.** If a design‑only Context tempts you into runtime talk, move that part of the narrative into a **run‑Context** and Bridge as needed.
6. **Keep the page living.** When upstream rows/bridges evolve (F.7–F.9), adjust the page *minimally* and call out the change in a margin note (conceptual, not procedural).

---

## 16 · Teaching variants (all obey §6 invariants)

* **Two‑Context equivalence.** Smallest case: 1 row, 2 Contexts, **β (≡, CL=3)** to explain why they’re truly the same *for this claim*.
* **Triangulation.** 1 row, 3 Contexts; typical for *measurement ↔ service ↔ execution*.
* **Disjointness lesson.** No row; one **β (disjoint)** plus a short SoD story.
* **Window primer.** Same sense across Contexts but different default windows; the page is about the **window choice**, not the term.

---

## 17 · Didactic checklist (author’s quick scan)

* One sentence **claim**?
* **Contexts** (with editions) visible?
* **SenseCells** named (tech & plain labels acceptable)?
* **Exactly one** tight **row** (or two, each justified)?
* All Cross‑context steps shown as **β(kind, CL, loss)**?
* **Role Description → one SenseCell** each?
* **Window** present where numbers meet?
* **SoD** stated where duties appear?
* Page fits a **single view**?

---

## 18 · Closing distillation (30‑second echo)

> A strong worked example is a **one‑page alignment**: claim → Contexts → cells → **one row** → explicit **bridges** → Role-Description hooks → window/SoD if needed. No tooling, no process charts—just **visible thinking** that any careful reader can replay and critique at the right place.


# F.17 — Unified Term Sheet (UTS) \[A]

**“One table that a careful mind can hold.”**
**Status.** Architectural pattern \[A], architheory‑agnostic.
**Builds on:** F.1–F.3 (Contexts → seeds → local senses), F.4 (Role Characterisation), F.5 (Naming), F.7 (Concept‑Set table), F.8 (Mint/Reuse decision), F.9 (Bridges), F.10–F.12 (Status & method/service bindings), F.15 (SCR/RSCR).
**Coordinates with.** A.1.1 `U.BoundedContext`, A.7 **Strict Distinction**, A.11 **Ontological Parsimony**, A.15 **Role–Method–Work Alignment**.
**Non‑goals.** No registries, workflows, editors, or storage formats. No by‑name Cross‑context equivalence. No “data pipeline.” This pattern prescribes **what a UTS is** and **how to judge it**, not how to generate files.

## 1 · Intent & Applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **single, normative table**—the **Unified Term Sheet (UTS)**—that distils the output of F.1–F.12 into **human‑readable rows**. Each row expresses **one Concept‑Set** unified into **one FPF U.Type** with its **Tech/Plain names** and **cross‑context senses**. The UTS is the *front‑door view* that authors, engineers, and managers use; it replaces scattered notes and eliminates guesswork.

**Applicability.** Produce a UTS **per architheory thread** (e.g., *Enactment — Role Assignment & Enactment*, *Method quartet*, *Trust & Evidence*). Use it:

* to **name** U.Types and their **Tech/Plain** labels (F.5),
* to **teach** the mapping from familiar canons to unified concepts,
* to **audit** coverage and heterogeneity (A.8), and
* to **feed** examples in Parts A/C without re‑explaining terminology.

**Why now.** Earlier F‑patterns define *how to think*. **F.17** defines *what you publish* so others can think with you.

## 2 · Problem Frame

Without a single sheet:

1. **Locality is lost.** Mappings hide in prose; readers re‑globalise words.
2. **Naming drifts.** Teams adopt ad‑hoc labels that collide later.
3. **Coverage is opaque.** No quick check that ≥ 3 independent Contexts underpin each U.Type (A.8).
4. **Didactic load spikes.** Each section re‑teaches the same terms.

**UTS** fixes this by putting the **unification decision** and the **Cross‑context evidence** on **one line** per concept.

---

## 3 · Forces

| Force                             | Constraint in UTS                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Didactic primacy vs. fidelity** | UTS keeps **two names** (Tech/Plain) and **one‑line rationale**, but never misstates a source meaning.              |
| **Parsimony vs. recall**          | Each row is **one concept**; each concept cites **≥ 3 Contexts** overall across the sheet (per A.8).                   |
| **Locality vs. comparability**    | Senses are **Context‑scoped** (E.10.D1). Cross‑context relations are shown only as **explicit bridges** (F.9) with **CL**. |
| **General usability**             | Sheet must be **legible on paper** and **memorisable** (block structure, stable row order).                         |

---

## 4 · Core Idea

**A UTS is a Concept‑Set table with names.**
Each **row** = one **Concept‑Set** unified into one **FPF U.Type** (the “what we mean”).
Each **column family** shows **how this concept appears** in chosen **context of meaning** (F.1).

Two **canonical layouts** are allowed (pick one or publish both):

* **Layout A — Kernel‑first**: rows keyed by **FPF U.Type**; **Bounded‑Context Columns (BCC)**.
* **Layout B — Base‑concept**: rows keyed by **Base concept** (EN/RU) of a discipline, then unified to **U.Type**; **Discipline Columns (DC)**.

Both layouts are normative; choose based on audience. In Layout A, comparability is by **BCC** (*Bounded‑Context Column*); in Layout B, comparability is by **DC** (*Discipline Column*); never conflate the two.

## 5 · Minimal Vocabulary (for this pattern)

* **UTS (Unified Term Sheet).** The published, human‑readable table per thread.
* **Context.** Alias in Tech register for **`U.BoundedContext`** (E.10.D1). Normative unit of meaning; every SenseCell is scoped to a Context _(name + edition)._  
* **Bounded‑Context Column (BCC).** A didactic column used **only in Layout A**; one column per **Context (`U.BoundedContext`)** from the F.1 cut; **not a model element**; carries **no editions**.  
* **Discipline Column (DC).** A _discipline vantage_ used **only in Layout B** (e.g., _Operational Management_, _IT/Software_, _Physics_). A DC is **not** a **Bounded‑Context Column** and does not carry editions.  
* **Concept‑Set (CSR).** One unified concept with pointers to its SenseCells.  
* **SenseCell.** _(Context × Local‑Sense)_ address—how a Context “says that thing”.  
* **Bridge / CL.** Explicit cross‑Context mapping (F.9) with Congruence Level and Loss note.  
* **Block Plan.** Didactic grouping of rows to keep the sheet memorizable.  
* **Unified Tech name / Unified Plain name.** Dual‑register names chosen per F.5; the **Tech name is the neutral, unified term** for the U.Type, not a borrowed Context name.

> **Discipline.** “Context” always means **`U.BoundedContext`** (E.10.D1). No global words.

## 6 · Row Schema (normative)

Every UTS row **MUST** carry the following fields (verbatim headings recommended):

| Field                     | Purpose                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **# / Block**             | Stable id and didactic block (see §7).                                                                |
| **FPF U.Type**            | Canonical kernel type (e.g., `U.Work`).                                                               |
| **Unified Tech name**     | Short technical name used in spec prose (F.5).                                                        |
| **Unified Plain name**    | Everyday name for non‑specialists (F.5).                                                              |
| **FPF Description**       | One‑line definitional gist (no examples).                                                             |
| **SenseCells (by context)** | Per selected Context: the local term(s) or construct that best realises the concept (one cell per Context). |
| **Bridges (CL/Loss)**     | If senses are related via F.9 bridges: CL score and a 2–6 word loss note (optional if CL=3 exact).    |
| **Unification Rationale** | One sentence: why these senses are the same *conceptually*.                                           |
| **Notes (optional)**      | Brief temporal stance or trip‑wire hints (e.g., “design vs run”).                                     |

> **Constraint.** “SenseCells (by context)” **MUST** cite **at least three** distinct contexts (metaphorically "Contexts") overall across the sheet for the thread (A.8). A single row may show fewer if the concept truly appears in fewer contexts; coverage is a property of the whole UTS.

**Discipline:** Every SenseCell **must** cite the **Context name + edition** (e.g., _“BPMN 2.0 (2011): Activity instance”_).

## 7 · Block Plan (didactic grouping)

A UTS **MUST** declare a **Block Plan**—the sequence of blocks that group rows. Blocks are **thread‑specific**. Example **Block Plan** for *Role Assignment & Enactment* (matches your earlier tables):

* **Block A · Context & Roles** — `U.BoundedContext`, `U.Role`, `U.RoleAssignment`, `U.Capability`.
* **Block B · Method & Description** — `U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription`, Access/Acceptance descriptions (fields of `U.Service`).
* **Block C · Execution & Schedule** — `U.Work`, `U.WorkDescription`, `U.Observation`.
* **Block D · Service & Deontics** — `U.Service`, `U.SpeechAct`, `U.Commitment`, `U.ServiceClause`, `U.ServiceEvaluation`.
* **Block E · Carriers & Bridges** — `U.Carrier`, *Alignment (Bridge entry)*.
* **Block R · Knowledge Units & Statuses** — `U.Episteme`, `U.EvidenceRole`, `U.StandardStatus`, `U.RequirementStatus`, `U.DefinitionRole`, `U.AxiomaticCoreRole`.

> **Rule.** Block names are **didactic**, not ontological. Do **not** infer mereology or subtyping from blocks.

## 8 · Column Families (two canonical layouts)

### 8.1 Layout A — Kernel‑first (U.Type as rows)

**Columns:**

* `FPF U.Type · Tech · Plain · FPF Description` (left rail)
* **Bounded‑Context Columns (BCC)** — one column per **Context (`U.BoundedContext`)** from the F.1 cut; each header shows _name + edition_: e.g., **OMG BPMN 2.0**, **W3C PROV‑O**, **ITIL 4**, **NIST RBAC**, **W3C SOSA/SSN**, **OMG Essence (Language)**, **DEMO/DEMO‑EO**, **PMBOK 7**, **CM/BPM (CMMN/BPMN)**, **IEC 61131‑3**, **ODRL 2.2**, **ISO 80000‑1 / Metrology** … *(your chosen 12 Contexts)*
* `Bridges (CL/Loss)`
* `Unification Rationale`
* `Notes`
  
Do not mix **Discipline Columns (DC)** in Layout A. Columns here are only **Bounded‑Context Columns (BCC)**.

### 8.2 Layout B — Base‑concept pivot (discipline columns)

**Columns:** Base concept · Scale‑map · Unified Tech name · Formal U.Type · **Discipline Columns (DC)** (e.g., Operational Management / IT/Software / Physics / …) · Rationale · Notes.

* `Base concept (EN / RU)`
* `Scale‑map (Σ / Π / μ)` *(optional; see §9.4)*
* `Unified Tech name`
* `Formal U.Type`
* **Discipline Columns (DC)** (choose 3–5): e.g., **Operational Management**, **IT/Software**, **Physics**, **Science/Theory**, **Math/Proof**, **Literature**, **Religion** *(or other discipline columns suited to the thread)*
  `Unification Rationale`
* `Notes`
 
> **Guidance.** Publish **Layout A** for kernel users and spec authors; publish **Layout B** for cross‑disciplinary onboarding and teaching.

## 9 · Invariants (normative constraints)

1. **Locality.** Every SenseCell is **Context‑scoped** (E.10.D1). No global synonyms.
2. **Bridges only via F.9.** Cross‑context equivalence appears **only** as an explicit Bridge with **CL**.
3. **Heterogeneity.** Across the UTS, coverage must involve **≥ 3 domain families** (F.1 Step 2; A.8).
4. **Scale‑map tags (optional but disciplined).** If used in Layout B:

   * **Σ (Summative):** concept’s quantitative properties aggregate across a population of executions/holders.
   * **Π (Conjunctive/Compositional):** concept composes by required conjunction (all‑of), not by averaging.
   * **μ (Micro/Atomic):** concept is inherently micro‑level (per single execution/holder).
     *(Tags aid teaching; they do not change semantics.)*
5. **Strict Distinction.** Use `U.Method` vs `U.MethodDescription`, `U.Work` vs `U.WorkDescription`, `U.Role` vs `U.RoleCharacterisation` correctly; do **not** collapse intensional objects with their descriptions.
6. **Dual register.** Every row has **Tech** and **Plain** labels per F.5.
7. **One‑breath rationale.** The `Unification Rationale` is a **single sentence** explaining the conceptual sameness despite local wording.
8. **9.7 Unified naming neutrality.** The **Unified Tech name** is the neutral FPF choice per F.5; it is **not** lifted wholesale from any single Context unless the Concept‑Set justification (F.7) shows identity.  
**9.8 Column discipline.** Layout A uses **Bounded‑Context Columns (BCC)** only; Layout B uses **Discipline Columns (DC)** only. Mixing is non‑conformant.

## 10 · How to Compile (conceptual moves, not a workflow)

**M1 · Fix contexts (F.1).** Declare the **12 (±)** contexts for this thread.
**M2 · Harvest & cluster (F.2–F.3).** Identify candidate senses per Context; cluster *within* Contexts; mint **SenseCells**.
**M3 · Form Concept‑Sets (F.7).** For each “the‑same‑thing” across Contexts, create one **CSR**; attach SenseCells.
**M4 · Name (F.5).** Choose **Tech/Plain** labels; assert the **FPF U.Type** (or propose a new one via F.8).
**M5 · Bridge (F.9).** Where Cross‑context relations are not exact, assert Bridges with **CL** and a short **Loss** note.
**M6 · Place rows into blocks (§7).** Keep the sheet memorizable.
**M7 · Write one‑line `FPF Description` and the `Rationale`.**
**M8 · Run acceptance harness (F.15).** Apply the UTS checks in §11.

> **Note.** These are **thought moves**. No tooling is implied or required.

## 11 · Acceptance Harness (SCR/RSCR) for a UTS

### 11.1 Static Conformance Rules (SCR‑UTS)

* **SCR‑UTS‑01 (Row completeness).** Each row contains: `U.Type`, `Tech`, `Plain`, `FPF Description`, `SenseCells (≥ 1)`, `Rationale`.
* **SCR‑UTS‑02 (Dual register).** Each row has both Tech and Plain labels; Tech is used in spec prose, Plain in didactics.
* **SCR‑UTS‑03 (Locality discipline).** Every SenseCell is cited **with its Context name & edition**.
* **SCR‑UTS‑04 (Heterogeneity).** Across the sheet, the set of referenced Context spans **≥ 3 domain families**.
* **SCR‑UTS‑05 (Bridge honesty).** Any Cross‑context sameness claim not backed by identity of structure uses a **Bridge** with **CL** (no by‑name equality).
* **SCR‑UTS‑06 (One‑breath rationale).** The rationale is ≤ 35 words and states the **conceptual invariant** that unifies the row.
* **SCR‑UTS‑07 (Block parsimony).** Block Plan uses **≤ 7 blocks**; each block’s rows can be recited from memory by a careful reader.
* **SCR‑UTS‑08 (Strict Distinction).** No row description conflates Method↔MethodDescription, Work↔WorkDescription, Role↔RoleCharacterisation.
* **CR‑UTS‑09 (Unified naming).** Each row’s **Unified Tech name** complies with F.5 rules (dual register, minimal generality, morphology); it is not a mere alias of one Context unless justified by an F.9 Bridge with **CL=3**.
* **SCR‑UTS‑10 (Column discipline).** **Layout A:** all non‑left‑rail columns are **Contexts** with editions. **Layout B:** all non‑left‑rail columns are **discipline columns**. No cross‑use.

### 11.2 Regression Rules (RSCR‑UTS)

* **RSCR‑UTS‑A (Edition churn).** When a Context’s edition changes, old SenseCells remain addressable; new cells are added; **no silent rewrites**.
* **RSCR‑UTS‑B (Name stability).** Tech labels change only with a documented F.5 decision; Plain labels may evolve didactically if the Tech name stays.
* **RSCR‑UTS‑C (Coverage drift).** Adding/removing rows **must not** reduce family heterogeneity below §9.3.
* **RSCR‑UTS‑D (Loss drift).** If new evidence changes a Bridge’s CL/Loss, the row updates both the CL and the 2–6 word loss note.

## 12 · Canonical Heading Templates (fill with your Contexts/Discipline columns)

**Layout A — Kernel‑first**

```
# | Block | FPF U.Type | Unified Tech name | Unified Plain name | FPF Description

## 13 · Didactic Aids

* **Trip‑wire column (optional).** A ⚡ marker in `Notes` for known homonyms (e.g., *process (BPMN) ≠ process (thermo)*).
* **Temporal stance tag (optional).** `design` / `run` hint for concepts whose senses split by time.


## 14 · Micro Examples (one line each, illustrative)

*(These illustrate Layout A headings; swap Contexts to match your cut.)*

**Row: `U.Work` (Execution)**
`Tech=Execution · Plain=run` — “Dated, resource‑consuming occurrence realising a MethodDescription.”
**BPMN 2.0 (2011)**: *Activity instance* · **PROV‑O (2013)**: `prov:Activity` · **ITIL4**: *change/incident record (run)* · **SOSA/SSN**: *(context: producer of Observation)* · **Essence (Language)**: *Activity occurrence* · **Bridges**: CL=3 (BPMN≍PROV) · **Rationale**: *All cells denote the concrete happening, not the recipe nor the capability.*

**Row: `U.MethodDescription` (Recipe)**
`Tech=MethodDescription · Plain=recipe` — “Recorded specification guiding executions.”
**BPMN 2.0 (2011)**: *Process model* · **PROV‑O (2013)**: `prov:Plan` · **ITIL4**: *SOP / Work instruction* · **Essence (Language)**: *Activity space/Practice description* · **Bridges**: CL=2 (loss: control‑flow vs intent) · **Rationale**: *All cells denote the codified ‘how’, distinct from both the performer and the run.*

> These rows are examples only; your UTS MUST be compiled from your chosen **Contexts** (Layout A) or **Discipline Columns (DC)** (Layout B) and SenseCells.

## 15 · Relations

* **Builds on:** F.1–F.3 (contexts & local senses), F.7 (Concept‑Set), F.5 (names), F.9 (Bridges).
* **Feed:** Part A and Part C definitions/examples (row ids used as cross‑refs); teaching bundles (F.16).
* **Constrained by.** A.7 **Strict Distinction**, A.11 **Parsimony**, E.10.D1 **Context discipline**.

## 16 · Migration Notes

* **Re‑blocking.** If the Block Plan changes, keep row ids stable; move rows between blocks rather than renumbering.
* **Context growth.** When adding a new Context, populate SenseCells progressively; do not claim coverage until ≥ 1 row per block cites it.
* **Name evolution.** Update **Plain** labels freely for pedagogy; change **Tech** labels only via F.5 with clear S‑rules.


## 17 · FAQ (authoring hygiene)

**Q1. Is the UTS a registry?**
*A.* No. It is a **didactic publication artifact**. No CRUD semantics, no workflows.

**Q2. Can we collapse two Contexts if their terms look identical?**
*A.* Only via **F.9 Bridge** with **CL=3**. Identity must be argued, not assumed by spelling.

**Q3. Where do state‑graphs (A.2.5) show up?**
*A.* In `Notes` or as a dedicated row if the stateful nature of a Role family is central to the thread.

**Q4. How do we show deontic approvals?**
*A.* The concept rows (`U.SpeechAct`, `U.Commitment`, `U.ServiceClause`, `U.ServiceEvaluation`) make the communicative/epistemic pieces visible; enactment appears in examples, not as sheet mechanics.

## 18 · 90‑Second Teaching Script

> “To make our language usable, we publish a **Unified Term Sheet** for each thread. Each **row** is one **unified concept** (a Concept‑Set) named with a **Tech** and a **Plain** label and tied to concrete senses in our chosen **context of meaning**. If two contexts differ, we show an explicit **Bridge** with a **CL score** and a short **loss note**. The rows are grouped into 5–7 **didactic blocks** so the whole sheet fits in working memory. This is not a database; it’s the **one table** a careful mind can hold. From this sheet, everyone—engineers, managers, researchers—can talk precisely about **the same things** across disciplines.”

# **F.18 — Local‑First Unification Naming Protocol** \[A]
*Status: normative (Part F, Unification Suite). Audience: engineer‑managers, lead architects, editors of FPF artefacts. 

### 1. Context

Part F establishes a *local‑first* discipline: meanings live inside a **Bounded Context** (“Context of meaning”), and Cross‑context relations exist only as explicit **Alignment Bridges** with stated fit/loss. Within that discipline, teams still need **names** they can speak, read, and govern. Names must carry enough signal for everyday use, yet never smuggle in Cross‑context identities, hidden assumptions, or role/metric clutter. F.18 supplies that naming discipline and weaves it through F.1–F.17: Term Harvesting, Sense Clustering, Role Descriptions, Concept‑Sets, Bridges, Lexical Continuity, Anti‑Explosion control, and the Unified Term Sheet (UTS).

**Purpose of this pattern.** Provide a **human‑legible, context‑anchored naming protocol** that:

* keeps *local meaning first* and prevents Cross‑context conflation;
* makes the **kind** of thing explicit (System, Episteme, Role, Service, Method, Work, Decision, Requirement, etc.);
* integrates smoothly with **Concept-Sets**, **`U.RoleDescription`**, and **Bridges** without requiring any special notation or tooling;
* supports lifecycle actions (mint, reuse, align, deprecate, split/merge) with a paper trail that managers can audit.

---

### 2. Problem

Without a shared naming protocol inside Part F, the same recurrent failures appear:

1. **Global‑name illusion.** A short label travels from one context to another and is *assumed* to mean the same thing; later, contradictions surface during acceptance or assurance.
2. **Context drift.** A label gradually changes inside its Context (edition, scope, envelope) without leaving a clean trace; readers argue over “what we meant.”
3. **Kind confusion.** Names hide *what sort of thing* is being named (System vs Episteme vs Role vs Service, etc.), leading to category errors and brittle integration.
4. **Threshold‑in‑the‑name.** Numeric limits, duty segregation, or state qualifiers get baked into names (“Critical‑Reviewer‑0.2 mm”), which cannot age or compose.
5. **Stealth renames.** Quiet label swaps, steered by fashion or politics, sever continuity with earlier evidence, plans, and bridges.
6. **Explosion by synonyms.** Teams mint many near‑synonyms instead of reusing a Concept‑Set row or creating an explicit Bridge with loss notes.

These failures erode trust, block reuse, and make Part F machinery (Concept-Sets, `U.RoleDescription`, Bridges) harder to apply.

### 3. Forces

| Force                                      | Tension to balance                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local truth vs Cross‑context portability**  | The name must “belong” inside one context while remaining referenceable from other contexts through explicit bridges.               |
| **Human ergonomics vs conceptual clarity** | Short, natural labels help teams move; explicit kind and Context cues keep reasoning sound.                                          |
| **Stability vs evolution**                 | Names should be durable, yet easy to deprecate or refine without breaking links to past evidence and work.                    |
| **Brevity vs auditability**                | A compact “badge” for everyday speech, plus an authoritative **Name Card** that records meaning, scope, edition, and lineage. |
| **Parsimony vs inclusivity**               | Reuse existing Concept‑Set rows where possible; mint new names only when indispensable in the local context.                     |

---

### 4. Solution — The Local‑First Naming Protocol

F.18 defines **seven rules** (R‑rules) and **four practices** (P‑practices). Together they produce **Name Cards** that any reader can interpret without guessing, and that slot cleanly into the rest of Part F.

#### 4.1 The Seven R‑rules (normative)

**R1 — Speak every name *with its Context*.**
A name is **never** context‑free. When you introduce or use a name, **pair it with the Bounded Context** where it lives (the “Context of meaning”), and with the **edition** of that Context if relevant. In everyday speech: “X, *in* Y.” Cross‑context use requires a Bridge; labels alone do not travel.

**R2 — State the *Kind* on the Card.**
Every Name Card **must** state the **Kind** (System, Episteme, Role, Service, Method, Work, Objective, Requirement, Decision, Characteristic, etc.). This prevents category errors and keeps Role–Method–Work alignment clean. *Clarification:* this is a **Card requirement**, not a demand that the label string begin with the Kind.

**R3 — Anchor the name to a *Local‑Sense*.**
A minted name **must** resolve to a **Local‑Sense** inside its Context (the result of F.2–F.3). If a name points to a Role Description, state that template and its sense basis. No name floats unattached.

**R4 — Use *Twin Registers* (Unified Tech + Plain).**
Provide two human‑oriented labels on the Name Card, per **E.10** register discipline:
* a **Unified Tech** label (short, morphology‑stable, neutral in wording);
* a **Plain** label (reader‑friendly phrasing for managers and subject‑matter experts).
The **Unified Tech** label is the only one used in **Core** normative prose; **Plain** is for teaching and examples. Both remain **context‑local**; neither establishes Cross‑context identity (that is the job of the **UTS row** and **Bridges**).

**R5 — Keep thresholds and states *out of the name*.**
Do not encode numeric limits, separation‑of‑duties, or readiness states in the label. Put thresholds on **Method steps** (capability/acceptance), states in **Role State Graphs**, and SoD via **incompatibility** relations. Names carry *what this is* and *which Context claims it*—not *when and how it may act*.

**R6 — Cross Context only by *Bridge* with loss notes.**
When another context needs to reference a name, use an **Alignment Bridge** that states the relation (equivalent, narrower, broader, analogous) and its **Congruence Level** with explicit **loss/fit** annotations. Never equate two names by label alone.

**R7 — Make renames and merges *first‑class events*.**
When a label changes, or two labels consolidate or split, record it on the Name Card as a lifecycle action (rename, merge, split, retire) with rationale and dates. Past uses *remain valid as historical facts*; continuity comes from lineage, not silent edits.

#### 4.2 The Four P‑practices (normative process)

**P1 — Mint‑or‑Reuse gate (F.8).**
Before minting, search your Context’s **Concept‑Set table**. If a row already covers your sense, reuse it and only add a **local label**. If not, propose a **new row** and capture the decision in a brief rationale.

**P2 — Concept‑Set linkage (F.7).**
Every Name Card **must** indicate its Concept‑Set row (or record “not applicable” for intentionally Context‑unique names). This is the handle for alignment and anti‑explosion control.

**P3 — UTS registration (F.17).**
Publish each Name Card to the **Unified Term Sheet** with Context, kind, twin labels, sense anchor, edition, and lifecycle status. Keep the UTS the single, human‑readable table of record.

**P4 — Lifecycle hygiene (F.13).**
Apply the same discipline to renames, splits/merges, and retirements; leave a forward/backward pointer so readers can trace continuity at a glance.

---

### 5. The Name Card (authoring template, representation‑agnostic)

A **Name Card** is the authoritative, human‑readable record of a name inside its Context. It has these fields; teams may add local notes.

0. **Row ID** — the stable, opaque **UTS row identifier** (the identity anchor).
1. **Context of meaning** — the Bounded Context and, if relevant, its edition.
2. **Kind** — what sort of thing this is (System, Episteme, Role, Service, Method, Work, Objective, Requirement, Decision, Characteristic…).
3. **Minimal Definitional Statement (MDS)** — one‑paragraph intended sense in the home context (no tool/process slang).
4. **Didactic subtitle** — ≤ 12 words that signal pragmatic use.
5. **Sense anchor** — a Local‑Sense reference (how F.2–F.3 clustered it).
6. **Twin labels** — **Unified Tech** and **Plain** (per E.10).
7. **Concept‑Set linkage** — Concept‑Set reference or “not applicable” (with rationale).
8. **Alignment note** — if a Bridge exists to other Contexts, cite it and record **loss/fit** in plain words (no formulas required on the Card).
9. **Relation kind & stance** — **structural** vs **epistemic**; declare `validationMode ∈ {axiomatic, inferential, postulate}`. For **structural** relations, provide **Constructive** grounding (`tv:groundedBy → Γₘ.sum|set|slice`). 
10. **Lifecycle** — current status (Idea, Draft, Pilot, Ratified, Deprecated) plus lineage (renamed‑from, split‑from, merged‑from) and steward contact.
11. **Manager’s clip** — one‑line “use/avoid” guidance for everyday communication.

**Manager’s reading habit.** When two names collide in a meeting, ask for their **Context**, **Kind**, and **Sense anchor**. If those three differ, you are comparing different things; switch to **Bridge** talk, not label talk.

### 6. What *belongs* in the label—and what does not

**Belongs (keeps the label clean and durable):**

* The **core head word** that signals the kind (e.g., “Pump”, “Standard”, “Requirement”, “Surgeon Role”, “Cooling Service”).
* A **purpose qualifier** if it is essential to the local sense and stable across editions (e.g., “Cooling” vs “Fuel”).
* A **scope qualifier** only if it is part of the *meaning* rather than the current plan (“Surgical Ward” rather than dates or batch numbers).

**Does not belong (move elsewhere):**

* **Numbers and thresholds** (put on steps, capabilities, acceptance clauses).
* **States** (use Role State Graphs and checklists).
* **Temporal windows** (work plans and history).
* **Organisational authorisations** (speech acts and assignments).
* **Imported acronyms** from other Contexts (use Bridges with loss notes instead).

**Quick litmus for authors.** If removing a number, date, or state *does not* change the *meaning* of the thing, it should **not** be in the label.

---

### 7. Worked triad (three short, context‑local examples)

*(Names below are illustrative; the same words in other Contexts may mean something else. The point is how the Name Card keeps them clear.)*

#### 7.1 Industrial operations Context: “Thermal Management · 2026”

* **Kind:** Service
* **Technical Label:** Cooling Supply
* **Plain Label:** Chilled water for line B
* **Sense anchor:** supply of water at defined temperature/flow to boundary B
* **Concept‑Set:** “Utility service” row; local variant recorded
* **Alignment note:** Bridge to “Plant Utilities · 2026” notes that “Cooling Supply” there bundles filtration; *loss:* filtration is not guaranteed in this Context
* **Lifecycle:** current

**Why it’s good.** The label doesn’t encode temperature or flow limits (those live in acceptance). It names a Service; nobody will confuse it with a pump System or a Method.

#### 7.2 Clinical Context: “Hospital OR · 2026”

* **Kind:** Role
* **Technical Label:** Surgeon Role
* **Plain Label:** Operating surgeon
* **Sense anchor:** person who is authorised to perform surgical steps under defined checks
* **Concept‑Set:** “Clinical roles” row
* **Alignment note:** Bridge to “Training & Credentialing · 2026” shows partial overlap; *loss:* that Context’s “Senior Surgeon” carries teaching duties that do not apply here
* **Lifecycle:** current; renamed‑from “Lead Surgeon” (2025) with rationale: avoided “lead” vs “operating” ambiguity

**Why it’s good.** No fatigue thresholds or readiness states in the name; those live in the Role’s state graph and checklists.

#### 7.3 Public service Context: “Civic Services · 2026”

* **Kind:** Requirement
* **Technical Label:** Passport Lead‑Time
* **Plain Label:** Time to issue a passport
* **Sense anchor:** elapsed time from complete application to issuance
* **Concept‑Set:** “Service quality requirements” row
* **Alignment note:** Bridge to “Legal Framework · 2026” records that legal “deadline” has different remedies; *loss:* legal exemptions not carried into this Context
* **Lifecycle:** current

**Why it’s good.** Target values (e.g., ≤ 20 days) are not in the label; they live in acceptance clauses.

---

### 8. Conformance Checklist (editor aid) — *Part I: naming & cards* (**non‑normative**)

**CC‑F18.1 (Context pairing).**
Every name used in normative text **must** be paired with its **Context of meaning**. If you cannot name the Context, you do not have a valid name.

**CC‑F18.2 (Kind clarity).**
Every Name Card **must** state the **kind** (System, Episteme, Role, Service, Method, Work, Objective, Requirement, Decision, Characteristic, …). Using labels that hide kind is non‑conformant.

**CC‑F18.3 (Sense anchoring).**
A minted name **must** resolve to a **Local‑Sense** in its Context. If a sense cannot be stated, label minting is deferred.

**CС-F18.4 (Twin registers).**
Each Name Card carries a **Unified Tech** and a **Plain** label (E.10). Tech appears in **Core** prose; Plain in teaching/examples.

**CC‑F18.5 (No thresholds/states in labels).**
Numeric limits, readiness states, and separation‑of‑duties **must not** appear in labels. Put them on steps, checklists, and role algebra.

**CC‑F18.6 (Bridge‑only travel).**
Cross‑context reuse of a name **must** go through an **Alignment Bridge** with an explicit relation and **loss/fit** notes. Label matching alone is forbidden.

**CC‑F18.7 (Lifecycle visibility).**
Renames, splits/merges, and retirements **must** be recorded on the Name Card with dates and rationale. Past occurrences remain valid as historical facts.

**CC‑F18.8 (Mint‑or‑Reuse gate).**
Before minting, authors **must** check the Context’s Concept‑Set table; if a row exists, **reuse** it with a local label unless a documented reason compels a new row.

**CC‑F18.9 (UTS entry).**
Names used in normative artefacts **must** appear on the **Unified Term Sheet** with the eight Name‑Card fields.

**CC‑F18.10 (No cross‑kind labels).**
Do not reuse the same Technical Label for different kinds inside one context (e.g., “Cooling” as a Service and as a Method). If unavoidable, add a stable qualifier to disambiguate and record the decision on both Name Cards.

**CC‑F18.11 (Manager’s clip).**
Each Name Card **should** carry a one‑line “use/avoid” note to guide everyday speech. Where omitted, editors add it during review.

**CC‑F18.12 (Anti‑explosion check).**
If three or more near‑synonyms for the same Local‑Sense appear in drafts, authors **must** either consolidate to one label or record an intentional synonym pair with use/avoid notes and a plan to converge.

### 9. Normative Contract (what must be true)

> This section is binding. It specifies the publication contract for unification‑oriented names in the Unification Suite (Part F), with **local‑first authority**, **bounded context clarity**, and **one‑way unification** upwards along the ladder. It complements, and does not replace, the structural and epistemic contracts elsewhere in FPF.

**9.1 Local authority & home.**
Every unification name has a **single home**: exactly one *Bounded Context* that authors and stewards it. The home is responsible for the definition, examples, and lifecycle of the name. Cross‑context reuse happens by **bridges**, not by relocating the home.

**9.2 Minimum definitional payload.**
A published name MUST ship with a human‑readable **Minimal Definitional Statement (MDS)** that states the intended sense in the home context, and a **Didactic Subtitle** (≤ 12 words) that signals its pragmatic use. The MDS must be free of process slang and implementation jargon.

**9.3 Row ID + label surfaces.**
For each adopted name, the home supplies:
* a **Row ID** (the opaque UTS identifier — the **identity anchor**), and
* two **label surfaces**: a **Unified Tech** label (for Core prose) and a **Plain** label (for teaching).
  Both labels refer to the same underlying sense; **Plain** may simplify terms, not premises.

**9.4 One‑way dependencies.**
Each rung on the ladder depends only **downwards**: a name at rung *n* can rely on names ratified at rungs ≤ *n*, never sideways or upwards. Cycles are prohibited. If a dependency is not yet ratified at the required rung, the new name remains Draft or Pilot.

**9.5 Local‑first before reuse.**
Teams MUST first mint locally (within their Bounded Context) and only then consider reuse. Reuse is done by **alignment bridges** that map the local sense to an existing sense elsewhere, without collapsing the local home.

**9.6 Sense, not string.**
Publication concerns **sense** (intended meaning in context), not the literal string. Synonyms are allowed as **Working-Names** if they point to the same Concept-ID and pass the tests in §12. Strings must not be treated as identity.

**9.6 Sense, not string.**
Publication concerns **sense** (intended meaning in context), not the literal string. Synonyms are allowed as **Plain** labels or **aliases** only if they point to the same **Row ID** and pass the tests in §14. Strings must not be treated as identity.

**9.7 Relation-kind discipline (structural vs epistemic).**
If the public name surfaces a **structural relation**, its intended sense **MUST** be backed by *exactly one Constructive trace* in the structural calculus (Compose-CAL) and **SHALL** declare `validationMode=axiomatic` (see E.14). If the name surfaces an **epistemic relation**, Constructive backing is optional; **declare** `validationMode ∈ {inferential, postulate}` and use **Logical/Mapping** and/or **Empirical Validation** as appropriate. **Do not mix relation kinds** inside a single name. *(Do not use “Tier-1/2”; formality is expressed via F per C.2.3.)*

**9.8 Member vs Component.**
Names that describe collection membership MUST NOT be used to imply part‑whole structure, and vice versa. If both aspects are needed, publish two names with their own MDS and an explicit bridge.

**9.9 Lifecycle states.**
A name travels through **Idea → Draft → Pilot → Ratified → Deprecated**. Transitions require explicit human review gates. Ratified names carry a clear stewardship contact and date.

**9.10 Anti‑duplication duty.**
Before ratification, the home MUST perform a **near‑neighbor review**: identify adjacent names, record the decision to align, merge, or keep separate, and publish the rationale in the name’s record.

**9.11 Local clarity over global neatness.**
When in doubt, prefer **local intelligibility** for practitioners over global symmetry. Global neatness can be achieved later via bridges; loss of local sense is hard to repair.

**9.12 No imported tool terms in Core names.**
Names and their MDS must not carry terms whose only meaning is tied to operating tools or pipelines. If such terms are unavoidable in pedagogy, confine them to Working-Names and examples with disclaimers.

**9.13 Human‑only conformance.**
Conformance for this protocol is judged by trained human reviewers using the checklists in §12. Automated heuristics, if any exist in an organization, have no standing in the Core.

---

### 10. Rationale (why this exists and why these rules)

**10.1 Local‑first unlocks velocity without lexical debt.**
Centralized naming regimes seem tidy but slow learning and create brittle compromises. Local‑first minting lets teams speak clearly **now**; unification comes from disciplined bridges and one‑way dependencies, not from premature centralization.

**10.2 One home lowers ambiguity.**
Names with “many owners” drift. A **single home** concentrates accountability for sense, examples, and lifecycle, while still enabling broad reuse via alignment bridges.

**10.3 Unified Tech + Plain serve two audiences.**
Engineers need **precise** wording; managers and stakeholders need **approachable** wording. Splitting the surfaces keeps the same sense while protecting accuracy and pedagogy; both are anchored by the **Row ID**.

**10.4 One‑way ladder prevents conceptual knots.**
Acyclic dependencies cut off circular definitions and policy deadlocks. The ladder provides a simple mental model: *build on what is already firm*.

**10.5 Relation-kind discipline prevents category errors.**
Part-whole claims **(structural)** must rest on **Constructive** grounds (`tv:groundedBy → Γₘ.sum|set|slice`, `validationMode=axiomatic`). Experience-based or evaluative relations **(epistemic)** follow assurance rules (**Logical/Mapping**, and **Empirical Validation** when *postulate*), with an explicit `validationMode ∈ {inferential, postulate}`. Mixing relation kinds inside a single name confuses review and invites hidden assumptions. 

**10.6 Sense over string reduces false conflicts.**
Disputes often orbit the string (“we hate that word”). By separating **sense** (what we mean) from **string** (how we say it), the protocol enables peaceful coexistence: keep the Concept-ID constant; permit multiple Working-Names if needed.

### 11. Application Guidance (how to apply, step by step)

**11.1 Prepare (30–60 min).**

* Clarify **your Bounded Context** and audience.
* Collect 2–3 typical user stories that require the name.
* Scan near‑neighbors in adjacent contexts (see §12.2 checklist).

**11.2 Mint locally.**

* Write the **MDS** in plain language, one paragraph.
* Draft a **Didactic Subtitle** (≤ 12 words): “what this name buys you.”
* Decide whether the intended **relation kind** is **structural** or **epistemic** (do not mix), and declare `validationMode`.

**11.3 Choose surfaces.**

* **Concept-ID**: concise, technical clarity; avoid metaphor.
* **Working-Name**: approachable; may include metaphor if it cannot distort the Concept-ID.

**11.4 Place on the ladder.**

* Verify all dependencies are at the same rung or below.
* If a dependency is still Draft/Pilot, keep this name at most Pilot.

**11.5 Align, don’t erase.**

* Where overlap exists with another context, propose an **alignment bridge**.
* Keep your home; record the mapping and any known divergence in reading.

**11.6 Publish and steward.**

* Publish the name with MDS, subtitle, rung, home contact, examples.
* Schedule a **first refresh**: when should the home examine usage and drift?

**11.7 Deprecate gracefully.**

* If the sense is superseded, publish **Deprecation Notes**: what to use instead, and why. Keep old Working-Names visible long enough to allow safe migration.

**11.8 The “Friday test.”**

* On a busy Friday, could a competent colleague apply the name correctly using only the MDS, subtitle, and two examples? If not, refine before ratification.

### 12. Examples (worked mini‑cases for engineer‑managers)

> These examples are deliberately simple. They show how local‑first minting, one‑way unification, and tier discipline operate together.

**12.1 “Module” vs “Component” (engineering structure).**

* *Home A (Platform)* mints **Component** with MDS: “A physically or logically integrated part whose removal would alter the integrity of the whole.” **Structural**.
* *Home B (App Team)* mints **Module** with MDS: “A deployable bundle of functionality maintained as a unit.” **Epistemic** (usage practice), not a structural claim.
* **Unification:** An alignment bridge states: “In Platform, every Component may host one or more Modules; Modules are not Parts.” Dependencies are one‑way: *Module* depends on *Component*; *Component* does not depend on *Module*. No synonymy asserted. Both names remain in their homes.

**12.2 “Incident” vs “Event” (operational sense).**

* *Home C (Operations)* mints **Incident** with MDS: “An unplanned interruption or reduction in the quality of a service.” **Epistemic**.
* *Home D (Monitoring)* mints **Event** with MDS: “A recorded observation of a state change in a system.” **Epistemic**.
* **Unification:** Bridge notes: “Some Events are Incidents when they degrade service; not all Events are Incidents.” Working-Names may vary (e.g., “Outage” as a Working-Name for Incident) but the Concept-IDs stay distinct. No part‑whole claims are implied.

**12.3 “Customer” vs “Account Holder” (business roles).**

* *Home E (Sales)* mints **Customer**: “A party that receives value from an offering in exchange for consideration.” **Epistemic**.
* *Home F (Finance)* mints **Account Holder**: “A party legally responsible for an account.” **Epistemic**.
* **Unification:** Bridge states overlaps and divergence: “A Customer can be an Account Holder; an Account Holder may not be a Customer (e.g., trustee).” The homes retain stewardship; a shared Working-Name “Client” may be used in executive materials with a clear note: **Working-Name only; see Concept-IDs for decisions**.

**12.4 “Batch” vs “Lot” (collection vs integration).**

* *Home G (Manufacturing)* mints **Batch**: “A collection of items produced under shared conditions.” **Epistemic membership**.
* *Home H (Quality)* mints **Lot**: “An integrated whole packaged and tracked as one item.” **Structural whole**.
* **Unification:** Explicitly separate **Member‑of** readings from **Part‑of**. A bridge explains lawful conversions (e.g., how multiple Batch members may become Components of a Lot through an integration process). Names stay distinct; cross‑rung dependencies are avoided.

### 13. Anti‑Patterns & Failure Modes (what to avoid)

**13.1 “Global name first.”**
Trying to coin a single global string before local understanding is mature. **Fix:** mint locally, publish MDS, then align.

**13.2 “Synonym storm.”**
Collecting many strings without stabilizing the Concept-ID. **Fix:** one Concept-ID per sense; multiple Working-Names only if they truly help didactics.

**13.3 “Process leakage into names.”**
Burying workflow or tool steps inside the MDS. **Fix:** keep process in method descriptions; keep names about sense, not procedure.

**13.4 “Member‑implies‑part.”**
Letting collection names induce part‑whole claims. **Fix:** separate names, separate MDS; don’t smuggle structure into membership.

**13.5 “Sideways dependency.”**
Defining a name by appealing to another Draft at the same rung or higher. **Fix:** depend only downward or postpone ratification.

**13.6 “Working-Name drift.”**
Letting a Working-Name accumulate extra meanings absent in the Concept-ID. **Fix:** periodic Working-Name review; prune metaphors that start bending sense.

---

### 14. Assurance & Conformance (human‑only checks)

**14.1 Author checklist (before requesting review).**

* [ ] I identified the **home Bounded Context** and audience.
* [ ] I wrote a clear **MDS** (≤ 1 paragraph) and a **Didactic Subtitle** (≤ 12 words).
* [ ] I declared the **relation kind** (structural vs epistemic) and the **validationMode**; no mixing.
* [ ] If **structural**, I can point to **exactly one Constructive trace** that backs the structural claim.
* [ ] I surveyed near‑neighbors and recorded my decision to align, merge, or keep separate.
* [ ] I produced both **Concept-ID** and **Working-Name**, with the same sense.
* [ ] Dependencies point **only downward**; no sideways or upward pulls.
* [ ] I scheduled a **refresh date** and listed 2–3 usage examples.

**14.2 Reviewer checklist (at the gate).**

* [ ] One home is declared; stewardship contact is clear.
* [ ] The MDS is free from process jargon and implementation slang.
* [ ] The declared **relation kind** is justified; **structural** claims are constructively grounded; **epistemic** claims declare `validationMode` and evidential posture.
* [ ] Member vs Component is respected where relevant.
* [ ] Alignment bridges are proposed where overlap exists, with explicit reading of convergence/divergence.
* [ ] The ladder discipline holds: acyclic, downward‑only dependencies.
* [ ] Working-Name does not smuggle extra commitments; Concept-ID and Working-Name remain co‑referential.
* [ ] Lifecycle state is accurate (Idea/Draft/Pilot/Ratified/Deprecated) and dated.

**14.3 Lightweight outcomes.**

* **Ratify** (meets all checks).
* **Pilot** (publish with explicit questions and a refresh date).
* **Revise** (return to author with targeted gaps).
* **Merge** (replace with an alignment to an existing name).
* **Deprecate** (publish successor guidance and sunset plan).

## 15 · Conformance Criteria (normative “CC‑F18”)

> These are **language‑level** obligations for authors and reviewers. They ensure every unified name is **local‑first**, **bridge‑aware**, and **teachable**.

**CC‑F18‑1 (Context first).** Every unified name **SHALL** be grounded in **local senses** that were harvested and clustered **inside named Contexts** (“context of meaning”) prior to unification. No name may be minted from free‑floating glosses or Cross‑context intuition. Use F.1–F.3 first.

**CC‑F18‑2 (Bridge‑only sameness).** Claims of sameness across Contexts **SHALL** be expressed only via explicit **Bridges** with a stated congruence and loss note. Mere spelling similarity never licenses a unified name. Use F.9.

**CC‑F18‑3 (Twin‑register naming).** Each unified concept **SHALL** carry **two labels**—a **Unified Tech** label (used in Core prose) and a **Plain** label (used for teaching). Labels are chosen per the naming discipline of F.5 and the register rules of **E.10**.

**CC‑F18‑4 (Neutrality of the Tech label).** The **Unified Tech** label **SHALL NOT** be borrowed wholesale from any single source Context where that borrowing would re‑import that Context’s private distinctions. Prefer a **neutral** term; **Cross‑context reuse occurs only via the UTS row and explicit Bridges**. (See F.5 “allowed/forbidden forms”.)

**CC‑F18‑5 (One concept per row, one Tech label per row).** A unified concept **SHALL** be captured as **one Concept‑Set row** in the **UTS**. Exactly **one Unified Tech label** is normative for that row; additional legacy strings are aliases in Annex (budgeted). Use F.7 with F.17.

**CC‑F18‑6 (SenseCell citations).** For each unified name, the **SenseCells** (Context × Local‑Sense) that justify it **SHALL** be cited in the UTS row with **Context name + edition**. Omit edition only if the Context has a single stable edition. See F.17 §6.

**CC‑F18‑7 (Sheet‑level coverage).** Within a thread’s UTS, the **set of rows** carrying unified names **SHALL** collectively cite **≥ 3 distinct Contexts**, ensuring breadth of evidence. Coverage is a property of the **sheet**, not of every single row. See F.17 §6 constraint.

**CC‑F18‑8 (No global words).** In Core text, **“Context” always means `U.BoundedContext`**; **discipline columns** may be used in teaching layouts but **is not** a bearer of meaning. Do not write context‑free claims of sameness. See E.10 and F.17 §5.

**CC‑F18‑9 (Didactic primacy).** A unified name **SHALL** be teachable on **one page**: its **UTS row** + a short narrative that a careful reader can replay (F.16 template). If it cannot be taught concisely, the naming attempt is premature.

**CC‑F18‑10 (No lifecycle connotations).** Names **SHALL NOT** encode imagined “maturity stages” or time‑ordering unless those are part of the concept’s intension. Stages belong in **state‑space** and dynamics narratives, not in names. (See A‑series CHR patterns.)

**CC‑F18‑11 (Strict distinction guard).** Names **SHALL** respect **A.7 Strict Distinction**: do not collapse **Role ↔ Method ↔ Work** or **Status ↔ Description** into one word. Align with F.11/F.12 where relevant.

**CC‑F18‑12 (Change control via F.13).** Renames, splits, merges, and retirements **SHALL** follow F.13’s lexical continuity rules; the UTS remains the canonical public surface for these changes.

## 16 · Anti‑patterns & safe rewrites (normative)

> Each item names a **speaking error** and a **local‑first repair**. Use this as an author’s lint pass before proposing a unified name.

| #  | Anti‑pattern (do **not** say)                           | Why it fails                                                    | Safe rewrite (how to speak)                                                                                         |
| -- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A1 | “These terms are the same **because they look alike**.” | Cross‑context **spelling** is not evidence of conceptual identity. | “We assert sameness **via a Bridge**; the loss note explains what survives across Contexts.” (F.9)                     |
| A2 | “Use the BPMN word as our Tech label.”                  | Imports BPMN’s local commitments into the unified term.         | “Choose a **neutral** Unified Tech label; cite BPMN as a **SenseCell** in the row.” (F.5, F.17 §6)                  |
| A3 | “Merge *process* (recipe) with *process* (execution).”  | Collapses **MethodDescription** with **Work**.                  | “Split the concepts: one row for **MethodDescription**, another for **Work**; align them in examples.” (F.11/F.16)  |
| A4 | “Our name encodes the lifecycle stage.”                 | Lifecycle phrasing sneaks in time.                              | “Name the **concept**; show **state‑space** changes in examples, not in the label.” (A‑series CHR rationale)        |

## 17 · Migration notes (renames, splits, merges, retirements)

**M1 — Start from Contexts, not from the old global word.** When inheriting legacy names, first **re‑harvest** terms inside the chosen Contexts (F.2–F.3). Only then decide whether to **reuse** or **mint** (F.8).

**M2 — Preserve reader muscle memory without duplicating meaning.** Keep the **Plain** label close to familiar speech, but make the **Tech** label precise. If a legacy term is overloaded, publish it as a **deprecated alias** in Annexes, not as a second Tech label. (F.13; Part H “Deprecated Aliases”.)

**M3 — Prefer split‑then‑bridge over vague merges.** If one legacy word covers two distinct concepts, **split** into two rows and add a short **relation note** between them (e.g., “recipe vs run”). Do **not** hide the split under a wide new name. (F.7; F.16.)

**M4 — Keep identifiers stable; move rows between blocks.** When the **Block Plan** evolves, move rows rather than renumbering; record the move in the row’s **Notes** field. (F.17 §16.)

**M5 — Upgrade rationale quality with worked examples.** Every rename or split should be accompanied by a **one‑page example** that shows the new row in action across at least **two Contexts**. (F.16; “tell‑show‑show”.)

---

## 18 · Worked examples (compact)

> Each example shows **how the Protocol steers naming** so engineers and managers can communicate without hidden Cross‑context leaks.

### Example 1 — *MethodDescription* vs *Work* (recipe vs run)

* **Context harvest:**
  *BPMN 2.0 (2011):* “Process model” (recipe) and “Activity instance” (run).
  *PROV‑O (2013):* `prov:Plan` vs `prov:Activity`.
  *ITIL:* “Work instruction” vs “Change implementation record.”
* **Unification outcome:** Two rows, two names.
  **Tech:** `U.MethodDescription` (Plain: “recipe”); **Tech:** `U.Work` (Plain: “run”).
  **Bridges:** recipe↔run **related**, not identical; loss note “control‑flow vs. execution.”
  **Why it matters:** Managers can schedule **Work** while authors improve the **MethodDescription**—no category errors. (F.11/F.16; F.17 rows.)

### Example 2 — *Service* (promise) vs *SpeechAct* (utterance) vs *Commitment* (deontic)

* **Context harvest:**
  *IT service canon:* “SLA/OLA clause”, “ticket approved”.
  *Speech‑act theory:* “performative utterance”.
  *Org governance:* “approval signature”.
* **Unification outcome:** Three rows: `U.Service` (promise), `U.SpeechAct` (utterance), `U.Commitment` (deontic bond).
  **Bridges:** utterance **institutes** commitment; commitment **binds** service clause; no synonymy claimed.
  **Why it matters:** Status tracking becomes intelligible without pretending that a “service” acts. (F.12; F.17 blocks D/R.)

### Example 3 — *Characteristic* names without lifecycle bias

* **Context harvest:**
  *Quality canon:* “maturity level”; *Performance canon:* “throughput”.
* **Unification outcome:** Neutral Tech names: `U.ReadinessLevel` (ordinal) and `U.Throughput` (ratio).
  **Narrative:** Dynamics shown as **movement in state‑space**, not via names like “pre‑production process”.
  **Why it matters:** Prevents time from leaking into labels; dynamics stay explicit and comparable. (A‑series CHR rationale; F.17 §4–§6.)

---

## 19 · FAQ (authoring hygiene)

**Q1. How many Contexts must a naming proposal cite?**
**A.** The **sheet** for a thread should cite **≥ 3** distinct Contexts overall; an individual row may cite fewer if the concept appears in fewer Contexts. The point is breadth at the **UTS** level, not token‑stuffing rows. (F.17 §6 constraint.)

**Q2. Can a Source Context’s term ever become the Tech label?**
**A.** Only if its form is **already neutral** and does **not** smuggle in that Context’s private commitments. When in doubt, pick a fresh neutral Tech label and keep the Source term in **SenseCells**. (F.5.)

**Q3. Where do we put discipline‑vantage views like “Operations” vs “Research”?**
**A.** Use the **discipline columns** in a teaching layout if helpful, but remember: **discipline columns are not Context columns** and carry no editions. (F.17 §5.)

**Q4. How do we keep names stable while the story evolves?**
**A.** Keep **row ids** stable; evolve placement via the **Block Plan** and record moves in **Notes**. Use F.13 for renames/splits/merges. (F.17 §16; F.13.)

**Q5. What if two teams insist on different Tech labels for the same concept?**
**A.** Publish **one** Tech label; treat the other as a **deprecated alias** (Annex). Bridge their local senses on the row. (F.13; Part H.)

## 20 · 90‑second teaching script (for engineer‑managers)

> “**Local‑first** means we start in **context of meaning**—we harvest terms **inside** each Context and only then unify. A unified name is a **teachable promise**: one **Tech** label for precision, one **Plain** label for outreach. Its **row** in the **UTS** shows where the idea lives in real disciplines (the **SenseCells**) and how those Contexts connect (explicit **Bridges** with a brief loss note). We never equate terms by spelling; we argue sameness with a **bridge**. We also never bake stages or actors into names—those belong to **dynamics** and **roles**, not labels. When the story changes, we evolve names with **lexical continuity** rather than re‑inventing words. The result is a vocabulary managers and engineers can **hold on one page** and use the same way across projects.”

## 21 · Acceptance Harness (SCR/RSCR) for F.18

**Purpose.** Provide auditable, notation‑independent checks that a proposed unified name (and its publication on a UTS line) satisfies the **local‑first** unification discipline. The harness extends the general unification checks in **F.15** with **naming‑specific** obligations.

## 21 · Migration & Deprecation Notes (informative, naming‑specific)

1. **Start from rows, not strings.** When consolidating legacy labels, **build or revisit the Concept‑Set row** first; only then pick the **Unified Tech/Plain** names. This keeps **meaning** primary. **(F.7, F.17)** 
2. **Prefer alias over merge.** If the *sense* is stable but the label misleads, **rename and retain one alias**; if the sense changed, **mint a new row** (no retrofits). **(F.13)**
3. **Resist modifier types.** New adjectives (e.g., *Peak*, *Remote*, *Night*) usually belong to **windows** or **examples**, not to the unified name. **(F.10/F.12/F.14)** 
4. **Keep neutrality visible.** If stakeholders push a brand‑coloured label, document why the chosen **Unified Tech** is **neutral** and include the brand as an **alias** in Glossary/Annex. **(F.5, F.17)** 
5. **Don’t globalise a Context.** Never move a Context label into the unified name as if it were universal. Use **Bridges** to relate Contexts, with an explicit **loss note**. **(F.0.1, F.9)** 

---

## 22 · FAQ (authoring hygiene for engineer‑managers)

**Q1. Can we reuse a dominant industry term as the Unified Tech name?**
**A.** Only if the row’s Concept‑Set shows **exact identity** across Contexts; otherwise pick a **neutral** Unified Tech and list the industry label as an **alias** in the Glossary. **(F.5, F.17)** 

**Q2. Two terms look identical across Contexts—may we skip Bridges?**
**A.** No. **Sameness is argued, not spelled.** Publish a **Bridge** with relation kind and **CL** plus a short **loss/fit** note. **(F.9, F.0.1)** 

**Q3. When do we mint a new U.Type vs. add a new row vs. add an alias?**
**A.** Use **F.8 Mint‑or‑Reuse**: if the *intension* changes, **new U.Type**; if the *same thing* spans new Context, **new row**; if only the label misleads, **alias/rename**.

**Q4. Our team keeps proposing “qualified roles” (e.g., *Night‑Operator*). What do we do?**
**A.** Keep the **Role** unified and express qualifiers as **windows** on **Statuses** or as **example context**. This follows **F.14** and **F.12**.

**Q5. Can we compress two near‑equivalent rows into one to “simplify the sheet”?**
**A.** Only if the **one‑breath rationale** remains true after review and the Bridges support equivalence with the same or stronger CL; otherwise keep **two rows** with explicit differences. **(F.17, F.9)** 

---

## 23 · Didactic distillation (90‑second script)

> **“Name on a row, never on a whim.”** In FPF we **speak inside Contexts**, then unify across them by building **one Concept‑Set row per thing**. Only there do we mint a **Unified Tech** label (neutral) and a **Plain** label (teachable). If Contexts differ, we **Bridge** with a **CL** and a brief **loss note**. We **avoid adjectives** in names—variation lives in **windows** or **examples**. We keep **aliases scarce** (≤ 1 per register) and **never** rename across Contexts. That’s the **local‑first** protocol: rows before names, Bridges before claims, **clarity before comfort**. **Your UTS is the one page a careful mind can hold.**

# Part G – Discipline SoTA Architheory Kit

# G.0 — **CG‑Spec · Frame Contract & Comparison Gate** \[A]

**Tag:** \[A] (foundational contract; constrains G.1–G.5)
**Stage:** *design‑time* (establishes comparison legality & evidence minima; governs run‑time gates)
**Primary hooks:** **USM / Scope (G)** (A.2.6), **Design–Run split** (A.4), **Evidence carriers** (A.10), **Assurance F–G–R with Γ‑fold** (B.1, B.3), **Change rationale** (B.4), **MM‑CHR discipline** (A.17–A.19/C.16), **Creativity‑CHR** (C.17), **NQD‑CAL** (C.18), **E/E‑LOG** (C.19), **Bounded Contexts & Bridges + CL** (F.1–F.3, F.9), **Concept‑Sets** (F.7), **Mint/Reuse** (F.8), **RSCR** (F.15), **Lifecycle/Deprecations** (F.13–F.14), **UTS & Naming** (F.17–F.18), **No tool lock‑in** (E.5.1–E.5.3), **Lexical rules** (E.10).

## 1) Intent (informative)

Provide a **single, normative contract** for a **CG‑Frame** that (a) names *what may be compared or aggregated*, (b) defines **lawful gauges and aggregators** over CHR‑typed data, and (c) sets **minimal evidence** and **trust folding** rules so that all downstream generation (G.1), harvesting (G.2), measurement authoring (G.3), calculus (G.4), and dispatch/selection (G.5) operate **safely, comparably, and in‑scope**.

---

## 2) Context (informative)

A team is extending FPF with a **CG‑Frame** (e.g., *Creativity*, *Decision*, *Architecture trade‑offs*). G.1–G.5 reference **CG‑Spec** for lawful comparison, but absent a clear contract, projects drift into hidden cardinalization, ad‑hoc thresholds, and opaque evidence minima. **G.0** authors and publishes that contract.

---

## 3) Problem (informative)

Recurring pains without a frame‑level spec:

* **Undefined comparison set.** Teams compare quantities without a declared **Characteristic/Gauge** basis.
* **Illicit arithmetic.** Ordinals get averaged; units are mixed; polarity flips are implicit.
* **Opaque evidence minima.** Numeric gates run on *whatever is at hand*, not on declared **KD‑CAL lanes** or carriers.
* **Trust blur.** Cross‑Context reuse lacks **CL penalties** and Γ‑fold rules; selection **R_eff** is not auditable.
* **Inconsistent scope.** Global claims leak; boundaries and *aboutness* are not attached to names.

---

## 4) Forces (informative)

* **Pluralism vs. comparability.** Rival schools must co‑exist while enabling lawful comparison.
* **Expressiveness vs. safety.** Rich gauges and aggregators vs. **MM‑CHR** legality.
* **Locality vs. portability.** Context‑local semantics with explicit **Bridges + CL** when crossing.
* **Assurance vs. agility.** Minimal evidence gates that are strong enough to matter, light enough to adopt.
* **Design‑time vs. run‑time.** Keep contracts and thresholds **design‑time**; run‑time only *uses* them.

---

## 5) Solution — **The CG‑Spec contract**

A **notation‑independent** object, published to **UTS**, that fixes *what is comparable, how, and under which evidence and trust minima*.

For top‑level disciplines, CG‑Spec is restricted to comparability, tolerances, and aggregation surfaces where sufficient basis exists (KD‑CAL lanes, Worked Examples, Γ‑fold reliability). CG‑Spec MUST NOT introduce “universal” cross‑school scoring; run‑time choice belongs to the G.5 selector under CHR/CAL legality.

### 5.1 CG‑Spec · Data Model (normative)

```
CG‑Spec :=
⟨ UTS.id, Edition, Context, Purpose, Audience,
  Scope := USM.ScopeSlice(G) ⊕ Boundary{TaskKinds, ObjectKinds},
  Aboutness := ⟨TopicHolon, ReferencePlane ∈ {world|concept|episteme}⟩,
  ReferenceMap := minimal map{term/id → UTS|CHR|G.2} (stabilizes naming & aboutness),

  ComparatorSet := [ComparatorSpec…],                 // finite, explicit
  Characteristics := [CHR.Characteristic.id…],        // must exist in G.3 pack

  Gauge := map Characteristic.id → ⟨
    ScaleTypes, Polarity ∈ {↑|↓|=}, Unit alignment rules,
    CoordinatePolicy?, GuardMacros, AggregationSpecs
  ⟩,

  MinimalEvidence := map Characteristic.id → ⟨
    KD‑CAL lanes ⊆ {TA,LA,VA}, Carriers ⊆ A.10,
    Sample/Replication minima, Freshness/HalfLife,
    Bridge allowances (CL thresholds), I/D/S layer exposed to SCR fields,
    FailureBehavior ∈ {abstain | degrade.order | sandbox}
  ⟩,

  Γ‑fold := ⟨default:=weakest‑link | override(proof_refs, monotonicity, boundary)⟩,
  CL‑Routing := map Bridge.CL → penalty on R_eff only (F invariant),

  AcceptanceStubs := [AcceptanceClause template…],    // templates only; **context‑local thresholds live in CAL.Acceptance (G.4)**
  
  
  E/E‑LOG Guard := ⟨explore↔exploit budgets, probe accounting, NQD constraints⟩,

  RSCR := testset{illegal_op_refusals, unit/scale checks, threshold semantics, CL→R_eff routing},

  Naming := UTS Name Cards (required fields per F.17/F.18) with **Unified Tech** and **Plain** labels, Concept‑Set linkage, Bridge loss/fit notes, and lifecycle,
  Lifecycle := ⟨refresh cadence, decay/aging, deprecation + lexical continuity⟩,
  Provenance := ⟨carrier types, SoTA pack refs (G.2), DRR/SCR linkage⟩
⟩
```

**Notes:**

* `Characteristics[]` are pointers—no measurement semantics live here; those are authored in **G.3**.
* `Gauge` binds **what** aggregations/comparisons are lawful **for this Frame** over those characteristics (using **G.3 AggregationSpecs**).
* `MinimalEvidence` is the **gate** consumed by G.1/M4 and G.5: if not met, numeric comparisons **degrade** to safe forms or **abstain**.
* `Γ‑fold` must state monotonicity and boundary behavior if not weakest‑link; proofs/anchors go to **CAL.ProofLedger** (G.4).
* `CL‑Routing` sends penalties to **R_eff only**; **F** is invariant under Bridging.

### 5.2 SoTAPalette

1. **SoTAPalette (I).** Intensional profile of a discipline’s Schools and method‑families with intentions and tolerances:
* admissible TaskKinds/ObjectKinds,
* required CHR types,
* characteristic operators/proofs,
* typical CL bridges (with known loss).

1. **SoTAPaletteDescription (D).** Publication of the palette: 
* metadata of Schools, 
* Operator & Object Inventory, 
* Bridge Matrix with CL/loss notes, 
* micro‑examples, 
* UTS drafts. 
 
This is the “SoTA Synthesis Pack” of G.2 and must be citable in G.5 decisions.

1. **SoTAPaletteSpec (S).** Minimal gates on completeness/quality of a palette: 
* coverage of Schools/sub‑tasks, 
* minimum replications/carriers across KD‑CAL lanes (TA/LA/VA), 
* explicit CL penalties for reductions, and bans on illegal operations (e.g., ordinal ≠ mean). 
 
These gates are consumed by CG‑Spec.Acceptance and Γ‑fold where cross‑school comparison/aggregation is attempted

### 5.3 MethodSchool

* In this framework, **“scientific/engineering school” is an epistemic kind**: **`MethodSchool`** (I) with its **`MethodSchoolDescription`** (D) and **`MethodSchoolSpec`** (S).
* The **community of people** behind it is modeled separately as an optional **`SchoolCarrier`** that _carries_ a `MethodSchool` but does **not** determine cross‑school comparability rules.
* In the **SoTA‑palette**, entries are **`MethodSchool`** items (epistemic) with their D/S artifacts; the palette composes them and exposes bridges/limits. The Dispatcher (G.5) selects among these entries under CHR/CAL constraints; CG‑Spec (G.0) only governs comparability/Γ‑fold where justified.

MethodSchool (I): an epistemic formation (school‑of‑thought) identified by its method family:
- operator set and admissible transformations,
- admissible TaskKinds/ObjectKinds,
- necessary CHR types and proof idioms,
- canonical CL bridges and stated limits,
- stance on measurement scales and allowed algebra.
(Notes: This is an epistemic kind, not a social group. See §SchoolCarrier for the social carrier.)

MethodSchoolDescription (D): the documentary corpus of a School:
- charter/lineage and key references,
- Operator & Object inventory with CHR preconditions,
- Bridge Matrix (CL) with loss and validity regions,
- Worked Examples with CHR annotations,
- UTS drafts for typical tasks,
- KD‑CAL lane coverage and replication notes,
- explicit anti‑operators / banned reductions (e.g., ordinal ≠ mean).

MethodSchoolSpec (S): inclusion gates for a School to be considered comparable/aggregable:
- minimum replication across KD‑CAL lanes (TA/LA/VA),
- declared CHR prerequisites and proof idioms,
- declared CL penalties/conditions for any cross‑school bridge,
- Γ‑fold contribution rule (how evidence accumulates),
- prohibitions on illegal scale algebra.
These S‑level gates are referenced by CG‑Spec.acceptance only where aggregation/comparison is attempted; otherwise the School remains descriptive.

U.SchoolCarrier (I): optional social/organizational carrier (people, labs, consortia) linked via relation carries(MethodSchool). Carriers supply replication capacity and provenance but have no normative authority over cross‑school aggregation rules.

Γ‑fold: an evidence/reliability fold that aggregates only along declared commensurate dimensions; includes penalties from CL bridges and lane‑mismatch factors. Γ‑fold parameters MUST be cited to KD‑CAL lanes and Worked Examples; when absent, aggregation is disallowed.

Default composition: weakest‑link; admissible overrides: {min‑k‑of‑n, harmonic, conservative Bayesian}; override requires CAL.ProofLedger refs

### 5.4 Authoring Steps (S1–S6)

**S1 · Frame Charter (Scope & Aboutness)**
Declare **Context**, **USM scope**, *aboutness* (`TopicHolon`, `ReferencePlane`), TaskKinds/ObjectKinds; record boundary examples and non‑examples.

**S2 · Comparator Set & Gauge Draft**
List **which** comparisons/aggregations the Frame intends (e.g., dominance, lexicographic, Pareto, affine sums on interval/ratio with unit alignment). Bind each comparator to **G.3/AggregationSpecs** and attach **GuardMacros**.

**S3 · Characteristics Binding**
For each comparison you intend to allow, bind the **CHR.Characteristic id** and required **Scale/Unit/Polarity**; if missing, author in **G.3** or reuse via UTS (F.8). For any numeric encoding of ordinals, publish **CoordinatePolicy** with non‑entitlements.

**S4 · Minimal Evidence Gates**
Per characteristic, declare **KD‑CAL lanes** (TA/LA/VA), required **carriers** (A.10), freshness/half‑life, and **Bridge/CL allowances**. Define **failure behavior**: **degrade to order‑only**, **sandbox**, or **abstain**.

For unit mismatches specify **sandbox (quarantine) or refuse**; **degrade.order is not permitted for unit mismatches under MM‑CHR**.

**S5 · Γ‑fold & CL Routing**
Set default **Γ‑fold** for trust aggregation and the **CL penalty** table. Document proofs or references if overriding weakest‑link.

**S6 · Publication & Tests**
Mint **UTS** Name Cards with twin labels; attach **loss notes** for Bridges. Register **RSCR** tests: (i) refuse illegal ops (e.g., mean on ordinal), (ii) enforce unit/scale checks, (iii) verify threshold predicates on worked examples, (iv) verify **CL → R_eff** routing.
Acceptance depends on (a) presence of SoTAPaletteDescription (G.2) with attached CHR/CAL evidence (G.3–G.4), and (b) justification of any aggregation via Γ‑fold (reliability fold) with explicit CL loss accounting. Where evidence is insufficient, acceptance MUST fall back to per‑school reporting without cross‑school aggregation.

---

## 7) Conformance Checklist (normative)

1. **Context declared.** `CG‑Spec` is published **in** a `U.BoundedContext`; no global claims.
2. **Comparator set explicit.** Every permitted comparison/aggregation is named and typed; anything else **abstains by default**.
3. **CHR‑bound.** All compared quantities reference **CHR.Characteristic ids** with declared **Scale/Unit/Polarity**; guard macros attached.
4. **Minimal evidence published.** Per characteristic: **KD‑CAL lanes**, carriers, freshness, Bridge/CL allowances, and **failure behavior** are declared.
5. **Γ‑fold stated.** Default **weakest‑link**, or an alternative with proof obligations (monotonicity, boundary).
6. **CL penalties routed.** Cross‑Context penalties **MUST** reduce **R_eff** only; **F** is invariant.
7. **No illegal ops.** Ordinal **SHALL NOT** be averaged/subtracted; unit mismatches **SHALL** fail fast (MM‑CHR).
8. **Design/run split.** **AcceptanceStubs** provide templates in **G.0**; all **context‑local thresholds live only in CAL.Acceptance (G.4)**; nothing is hidden in CHR or code paths; manifests are externally inspectable.
9. **UTS‑ready.** Name Cards minted/reused with twin labels; Bridges carry **CL** and loss notes.
10. **RSCR wired.** Tests exist for refusal paths, unit/scale checks, threshold semantics, and CL→R_eff routing.
11. **Lifecycle set.** Refresh cadence and decay policy declared; deprecations follow **F.13–F.14** with lexical continuity notes.
12. **Aboutness present.** `TopicHolon`, `ReferencePlane`, and a minimal `referenceMap` are recorded.

---

## 8) Consequences (informative)

* **Lawful comparability.** Teams know *exactly* what can be compared/aggregated and under which evidence minima.
* **Auditable trust.** Γ‑fold and CL routing make **R_eff** computation transparent to selectors and reviewers.
* **Frictionless downstream.** G.1–G.5 consume a single spec; CHR/CAL avoid hidden thresholds; dispatch is explainable.
* **Local first, portable later.** Context‑local semantics are primary; Bridges make portability deliberate and costed.

## 11) Author’s quick checklist

1. Write the **Frame Charter** (Context, USM scope, Aboutness).
2. Enumerate the **ComparatorSet**; bind **Gauge** with guard macros and AggregationSpecs.
3. Bind **Characteristics\[]** to **CHR** ids; ensure Scale/Unit/Polarity are declared (reuse or mint in UTS).
4. Publish **MinimalEvidence** per characteristic (KD‑CAL lanes, carriers, freshness, Bridge/CL allowances, failure behavior).
5. State **Γ‑fold** and **CL‑Routing**; attach proofs/anchors if overriding weakest‑link.
6. Publish to **UTS** with Name Cards, twin labels, Bridges (+loss notes); register **RSCR** tests.
7. Set **refresh/decay**; log changes to **DRR/SCR**; maintain lexical continuity on deprecations.


## G.1 — **CG-Frame‑Ready Generator** \[A]

**Tag:** \[A] (uses CHR/CAL/LOG)
**Stage:** *design‑time* (produces design‑time architheories & assets; enables run‑time use by target architheories)
**Primary hooks:** *Creativity‑CHR* (C.17), *NQD‑CAL* (C.18), *E/E‑LOG* (C.19), *Trust & Assurance* (B.3: CC‑B3.2–B3.6; Γ‑fold)*, *USM / Scope (G)* (A.2.6),  Lifecycle/Deprecations (F.13–F.14), UTS & Naming (F.17–F.18), *RoleAssignment* (F.4), *Bridges/CL* (F.9), *Design–Run duality* (A.4). *Assurance arithmetic per B.3: F is ordinal, G is coverage, R is ratio; CL penalties hit R only*.

### 1) Intent

Provide a **repeatable generator scaffold** that, for a declared **CG-Frame**, (a) assembles a **local SoTA set**, (b) **emits** well‑typed **variant candidates** for private cases, and (c) **selects & packages** the winners into the **F‑suite** (RoleDescription templates, Concept‑Sets, UTS rows, names) with explicit trust and scope.

### 2) Context (Design‑time vs Run‑time roles)

* **G‑pattern (this):** defines the *authoring choreography*.
* **Design‑time architheories of a CG-Frame:** CAL/LOG/CHR bundles produced by G.1 into a **library for this CG-Frame** (e.g., “Creativity theories”, “Decision theories”). ; method artefacts publish as **MethodDescription** by default and become **MethodSpec** only when a falsifiable harness exists (E.10.D2/D3; I/D/S discipline).
* **Run‑time target architheories:** the deployed theories/methods that users run to generate ideas or make decisions (gated by B.3; separated by A.4).
* **Local glossary:** *DRR* = Decision Rationale Record; *SCR* = Selection Confidence Report (fields: chosen family, eligibility verdicts, Γ‑fold contributors, CL penalties, R_eff); **MDS** = UTS metadata stub (Name Card + twin labels).

### 3) Problem (recurring pains the pattern solves)

* SoTA is scattered; no **local, scoped** set for a CG-Frame.
* Variant generation is ad‑hoc; **private cases** lack a principled emitter.
* Selection is taste‑driven; **trust & comparability** are opaque.
* Output doesn’t land in **F‑artifacts** (RoleAssignments/UTS/names), so it can’t be reused.
* Design/run boundaries get blurred; provenance & scope go missing.

### 4) Forces (tensions to balance)

* **Breadth vs depth** (cover SoTA yet stay actionable).
* **Generativity vs assurance** (novel variants vs safety/trace).
* **Local meaning vs portability** (Context‑local semantics vs Bridges/CL).
* **Expressiveness vs parsimony** (new types vs reuse per F.8).

## 5) Solution — **Six‑module generator chassis**

*(Each module is a slot with explicit inputs/outputs and guard‑rails; minimal, substrate‑neutral.)*

**Ops:** normalise terms (F.2), cluster senses (F.3), draft Concept‑Set rows (F.7), **apply G.2 harvesting discipline** (discovery → claim sheets → bridge matrix)
**Outputs:** `SoTA_Set@CG-Frame` with provenance (A.10) + preliminary **UTS stubs** (F.17) **incl. twin labels + loss notes for bridged terms**
**Guards:** evidence anchors; CL for cross‑Context reuse (F.9); **lawful measurement (A.17–A.19/C.16)**; Trust baseline (B.3).

**M3 · Variant Emitter (illumination search)**

* **Inputs:** SoTA_Set; private constraints; resource envelopes

* **Guards:** explore↔exploit policy (C.19); SoD (A.2 `⊥`); no category leaks (A.7); **metric legality/typing per MM‑CHR (A.17–A.19/C.16)**;  If a score/aggregation implies cross‑candidate comparison, cite a registered **CG‑Spec characteristic**; otherwise degrade to order‑only or **abstain**.

**M4 · Selector & Assurer (fit‑for‑purpose)**

* **Inputs:** VariantPool; acceptance clauses; risk constraints
* **Ops:** evaluation & evidence (CAL hooks); **apply ConstraintFit=pass as an eligibility filter before any front computation**; **Γ‑fold** aggregation (B.1); F–G–R roll‑up (B.3) **with CL penalties routed to R_eff**; enforce **CG‑Spec.minimal_evidence** for any characteristic used in evaluation; gate Γ‑fold contributors accordingly; **when only ordinal semantics are lawful, avoid weighted sums and use lexicographic/median/medoid comparators**.

No tool lock‑in; semantics live in CAL/CHR.

## 7) Conformance Checklist (normative, terse)

1. **Context declared.** Every artifact is spoken **in** `CG-FrameContext` (U.BoundedContext); no global claims.
2. **Aboutness present.** Every …Description published in G.1 carries `about: TopicHolon`, `ReferencePlane`, and a minimal `referenceMap`.
3. **CG‑Spec required for comparisons.** Any numeric comparison/aggregation cites a **CG‑Spec** (characteristics, gauge, Γ‑fold); +     cross‑Context use via **Bridge + CL** with penalties to **R_eff** only (never to F).   
4. **Evidence anchored.** All SoTA imports and evaluations link to carriers (A.10); no self‑evidence.
5. **Design/run split.** Generators & selections are **design‑time**; operational runs are **Work** (A.4/A.15).
6. **Emitter governed.** NQD emitters operate under an explicit **E/E‑LOG** policy; portfolio coverage is recorded (C.18–C.19).
7. **Trust visible.** Each shortlist item carries ⟨F,G,**R_eff**⟩ with CL penalties (B.3; F.9).
8. **F‑surface complete.** Winners are published as **RoleAssignment/Concept‑Set/UTS** with local naming (F.4/F.7/F.17–F.18).
9. **Parsimony.** Prefer *reuse* over minting new U.Types (F.8); justify new ones via C.1 universality.
10. **Measurement typed.** All metrics use **CHR typing (Characteristic/Scale/Level/Coordinate)**; forbid illegal ops (A.17–A.19/C.16).
11. **SoD enforced.** Exploration authors ≠ selection approvers where required (A.2 `⊥`).
12. **Refresh set.** A cadence for evidence/variants is declared; stale items accrue **Epistemic Debt** (B.3.4).
13. **DRR/SCR emitted.** Every selection emits **DRR + SCR**; **R_eff** computed via **Γ‑fold** with CL penalties.
14. **UTS twin labels.** Published winners include **twin labels** and **loss notes** for any bridge.
15. **No tool lock‑in.** Core artifacts are notation‑independent; implementations live under **E.5.\***.
16. **RSCR wired.** Regression tests are registered for each published artifact (F.15).

## 8) Consequences (informative)

* **Generativity with guard‑rails:** wide variant search **and** computable trust.
* **Local first, portable later:** clear Context‑local semantics with **explicit Bridges** (CL) for crossing.
* **Direct line to F:** outputs are *immediately usable* in F.17 UTS & F.18 naming; no translation pass.

---

## 9) Worked micro‑sketch (to be expanded in the full G.1)

**CG-Frame:** Multi‑criteria Decisions in R\&D

* **M1:** `CG-FrameContext=R&D_Decisions_2026` (Γ‑fold default = weakest‑link for safety; mean for cost where interval/ratio scales allow; CL≥2 for cross‑Context reuse).
* **M2:** Harvest outranking, value models, portfolio fronts → SoTA_Set + UTS stubs.
* **M3:** Emit variants under constraints (budget, risk, hiring cap) via NQD; score by Creativity‑CHR.
* **M4:** Select with acceptance clauses (must meet safety reqs; cost within envelope) + ⟨F,G,**R_eff**⟩; **emit DRR + SCR**.
* **M5:** Publish RoleDesc templates (`DecisionRole`, `EvaluatorRole`), Concept‑Set rows for “Alternative/Option”, and UTS rows with **local names**.
* **M6:** Version `VEK‑Pkg@R&D` with refresh every quarter; decay old evidence after 12 months.

---

## 10) Relations (wiring map)

* **Builds on:* A.4 (time split), A.10 (evidence), B.3 (assurance), B.5.2.1 (creative abduction), F.1–F.3 (Contexts/lexicon), F.7/F.8 (Concept‑Sets; mint/reuse).
* **Imports:** C.17 (Creativity‑CHR), C.18 (NQD‑CAL), C.19 (E/E‑LOG), C.16 (MM‑CHR).
* **Publishes to:* F.4 (RoleAssignment), **F.15 (RSCR)**, F.17 (UTS), F.18 (naming), optional Bridges (F.9).

---

## 11) Author’s checklist (how to use the skeleton)

* Fill **M1–M6 slots** with the minimal cards (one page each).
* Keep **names local**; propose cross‑Context Bridges only after the local UTS is stable.
* Treat **Julia‑style specialisation** as a *design idiom* (parametric variant families), not as tooling.
* Commit every major decision into a **DRR** entry; wire outputs to **F‑artifacts** immediately.

---

## G.2 — **SoTA Harvester & Synthesis**   \[A]

> **Purpose.** Provide a rigorous, repeatable way to **discover**, **triage**, and **synthesize** state‑of‑the‑art (SoTA) across competing schools before we mint any CHR/CAL/LOG for a CG-Frame. The output is a **SoTA Synthesis Pack** that feeds naming (UTS), formalisation (CHR/CAL), and the algorithmic dispatcher (G.5).
> **Form.** Architectural pattern with a conformance checklist, aligned to FPF’s pattern grammar and publication contract.

---

### 1) Context

+Teams are extending FPF into a new **CG-Frame** (e.g., creativity, decision theory, evolutionary/hyper‑holonic architecture). The literature is **plural and contested** (ordinal vs cardinal utility; evidential vs causal decision theories; active inference vs classical control; quantum‑like cognition, etc.). We need a **discipline** that captures this plurality without collapsing meaning across Contexts, and that yields artifacts other G‑patterns can consume. **In all normative text below, “school” refers to the Tech token `MethodSchool` (Plain “school” allowed only as a 1:1 synonym).**

### 2) Problem

How to **systematically** assemble a *complete‑enough* SoTA view that:

* respects **bounded contexts** and **bridges** (no global meaning leaks);
* records **evidence & trust** attributes suitable for later calculus;
* identifies **incompatible commitments** and **points of translation loss**;
* produces **actionable payloads** (names, claims, operators, exemplars) ready for CHR/CAL/LOG authoring and later **multi‑method dispatch** (G.5).

---

### 3) Forces (tensions you must balance)

* **Pluralism vs. comparability.** Rival schools speak different dialects; we must compare **without** flattening their semantics (use Bridges with CL and loss notes).
* **Breadth vs. depth.** Coverage must be wide across sub‑fields yet deep on the load‑bearing claims.
* **Recency vs. stability.** Post‑2015 advances matter, but we need durable claims and exemplars.
* **Formalism vs. pedagogy.** Early outputs must be teachable and auditable (UTS + Name Cards).
* **Design‑time vs. run‑time.** Keep modeling commitments separate from operational policies and proofs; record the stance explicitly.

---

### 4) Solution (the harvesting & synthesis loop)

**4.1 Discovery funnel (iterate until saturation)**

* **Seed → Expand → Prune.** Start with canonical surveys & top venues (post‑2015); expand via forward/backward citation and method keywords; prune with *CG-Frame‑fit* and *load‑bearing* tests (does this claim change how we would model/decide?).
* **Contexting.** Assign each artifact to a **home Context** (Bounded Context + edition). If cross‑Context reuse is needed, draft a **Bridge** and a **CL** with a human‑legible *loss/fit* note.

**4.2 Claim distillation (per lineage/`MethodSchool`)**
For each school, extract a **Claim Sheet** (minimal, typed statements) with **F‑ratings**, **G‑scope cues**, and **R‑evidence anchors** **tagged with KD‑CAL lanes (TA/LA/VA)**, plus **Aboutness** (`TopicHolon`) and **ReferencePlane ∈ {world, concept, episteme}**; include a stub **referenceMap** (observable cues → prospective CHR).

**4.3 Operator & object inventory**

* Enumerate **characterisation candidates** (Characteristics, Scales, Levels, Coordinates) and **operators** the school needs. Park all measurement terms under **MM‑CHR** discipline (no ordinal arithmetic; declare polarity; unit coherence).
* Identify **decision objects** (options, lotteries, policies), **evidence objects** (observations, proofs), and **search objects** (frontiers, VOI heuristics) to be handed to CHR/CAL/LOG later.

**4.4 Alignment & divergence map**

* Build a **Bridge Matrix**: `MethodSchool`×`MethodSchool` with where alignment is possible, **CL** and explicit **loss**; **note that CL penalties route to R_eff only (F and G invariant)**.

**4.5 Didactic micro‑grounding & aboutness anchoring**

*For every load‑bearing claim, attach two micro‑examples …* **and link each micro‑example to carriers (A.10)** to serve as minimal anchors for future **CG‑Frame** characteristics and CHR cards.

**4.6 Publication surface (SoTA Synthesis Pack)**

* **UTS delta.** Proposed **Name Cards** (Unified Tech / Plain), Context, MDS, sense anchor, alignment/bridges, lifecycle = *Draft*. 
* **SoTA Tables.** Side‑by‑side claim sheets, operator lists, and exemplar pointers per school/Context.
* **Risk & trust notes.** Where translation exists, log **CL penalties** and evidence fragility for later **R** aggregation.

Required artifact for top‑level disciplines: SoTAPaletteDescription (D), accompanied by CHR evidence (G.3) and CAL traces (G.4). The SoTA Synthesis Pack MUST include: (i) claim sheets, (ii) operator & object inventory, (iii) bridge matrix (CL with loss notes), (iv) worked micro‑examples, (v) UTS drafts. This Description precedes any CG‑Spec normalization.

### 5) Payload (what this pattern *exports*)

1. **SoTA Synthesis Pack** for the CG-Frame (folder):

   * **G.2a** *Corpus Ledger*: bib entries + Context/edition + quick verdict (keep/park/retire).
   * **G.2b** *Claim Sheets* (per school) with F/G/R annotations.
   * **G.2c** *Operator & Object Inventory* (candidate CHR terms; CAL hooks).
   * **G.2d** *Bridge Matrix* with CL & loss notes.
   * **G.2e** *Micro‑examples* (1‑pagers).
   * **G.2f** *UTS Proposals* (Name Cards + proposed rows/aliases).
   * **G.2g** *Aboutness Map*: per school, a table `{term → TopicHolon, ReferencePlane, referenceMap stubs}`.

2. **Hand‑off manifests** to:

   * **G.3/G.4** (CHR authoring and CAL scoping) with the operator/object inventory;
  * **G.5** (Dispatcher) with a **Method Family Index** per school (candidate LOG bundles) **aligned to the Registry fields (Eligibility predicates, Assurance profile, CL notes)**.

### 6) Interfaces & dependencies

* **Consumes:** CG-Frame Charter (G.1), naming rules & UTS protocol (F.17), measurement discipline (A.17–A.19), **Bridges & CL (F.9) with Trust (B.3)** + CAL evidence hooks.
* **Produces:** Draft **\[D]** terms for **G.2 → G.3**; operator stubs for **CAL** in **G.4**; initial **LOG** families for **G.5**.

---

### 7) Conformance Checklist (author must be able to tick “yes”)

* **Contexts declared.** Every artifact has a **home Context**; cross‑Context reuse uses a **Bridge** with **CL** and a **loss note**. 
* **Rival schools kept disjoint.** No fused claims without an explicit alignment proof or Bridge. 
* **Measurement lawful.** All proposed characteristics/scales honour MM‑CHR guards (no illegal ordinal arithmetic; unit coherence; declared polarity). 
* **Didactic grounding.** Each load‑bearing claim has **two micro‑examples** (heterogeneous substrates). 
* **UTS‑ready.** Each candidate term has a **Name Card** draft with Context, MDS, twin labels, concept‑set linkage (or rationale for “not applicable”). 
* **Hand‑offs produced.** CHR/CAL/LOG manifests exist and reference the SoTA pack components. 
* **Aboutness declared.** Each Claim Sheet states `TopicHolon` and `ReferencePlane`; micro‑examples cite carriers (A.10).

---

### 8) Anti‑patterns & rewrites (what to avoid, what to do instead)

* **“Global definition” temptation.** *Don’t:* collapse causal, evidential, and thermodynamic decision theories into one utility function. *Do:* keep **parallel claim sheets** and map **where** and **why** they diverge; attach **Bridges** with CL.
* **Ordinal arithmetic creep.** *Don’t:* average Likert‑style scores across studies. *Do:* treat as ordinal; use order‑safe summaries, or justify interval mapping via MM‑CHR evidence.
* **Design/run blur.** *Don’t:* treat policy heuristics as proven laws. *Do:* tag stance, and route proofs/policies to the proper lanes.

---

### 9) Consequences

* **Comparable plurality.** Teams can hold multiple schools in view, compare them **safely**, and trace translation risk via CL.
* **Frictionless downstream work.** CHR/CAL/LOG authors receive **well‑shaped inputs**; UTS publication stays disciplined.
* **Pedagogical leverage.** Micro‑examples and Name Cards make the synthesis teachable and auditable.

---

### 10) Worked micro‑example (1 paragraph, indicative only)

*CG-Frame:* Decision theory. *Schools:* (i) **Classical expected‑utility** (ordinal vs cardinal utility variants); (ii) **Causal decision theory**; (iii) **Quantum‑like cognitive models**; (iv) **Active‑inference thermodynamic stance**.
*Moves:* Each school gets a **Claim Sheet** (e.g., form of choice rule, independence/separability, belief update), **Operator Inventory** (e.g., utility/likelihood/variational free energy), **Bridge Matrix** entries (*e.g.*, CDT ↔ EDT misalign on counterfactual conditioning; CL=2; *loss:* evidential dependence), two **micro‑examples** (manufacturing escalation vs human‑choice vignette), and **UTS proposals** for contested terms (`U.DecisionPolicy`, `U.PreferenceOrder`, `U.FreeEnergyBound`). (Downstream: G.3 authors CHR for *Decision Object/Profile/Policy*; G.4 authors CAL variants; G.5 registers algorithm families.)

---

### 11) Editorial template (1‑page “SoTA Sheet” per school)

* **Context & edition** · **Core claims** (typed; intended **F**) · **Objects & operators** · **Measurement stance** (MM‑CHR notes) · **Evidence stance** (what counts; typical *R* anchors) · **Micro‑examples** · **Known bridges** (targets; CL; loss notes) · **Citations (≥2015)** · **UTS candidates** (Name Card ids). 
  
  ## G.3 — **CHR Authoring: Characteristics · Scales · Levels · Coordinates** \[A]

**Tag:** \[A] (publishes CHR; constrains CAL/LOG)
**Stage:** *design‑time* (authoring & publication; enables lawful run‑time use by G.4/G.5)
**Primary hooks:** G.1 CG-Frame Card; G.2 SoTA Pack; **MM‑CHR discipline** (A.17–A.19/C.16); **Trust & Assurance** (B.3, Γ‑fold B.1); **Contexts & Bridges with CL** (F.1–F.3, F.9); **UTS & Naming** (F.17–F.18); **RoleAssignment** (F.4); **RSCR** (F.15); **No tool lock‑in** (E.5.1–E.5.3); **Lexical rules** (E.10); **Design–Run split** (A.4).

---

### 1) Intent

Provide a **notation‑independent authoring discipline** to turn SoTA plurality into a **lawful characterization layer (CHR)**: precisely typed **Characteristics**, **Scales**, **Levels**, and **Coordinates** with **guard‑rails** on what operations and aggregations are **legal**. The output is a **CHR Pack** consumable by CAL authoring (G.4) and dispatch (G.5), and publishable to **UTS**.

---

### 2) Context

You have a **CG-FrameContext** (G.1) and a **SoTA Synthesis Pack** (G.2) with competing schools, object/operator inventories, and Bridge/CL notes. Before any calculus (G.4) or run‑time dispatch (G.5), you must **stabilize measurement semantics**: name things, type them, and make illegal operations **impossible by construction**.

---

### 3) Problem

Teams repeatedly stumble on:

* **Meaning leaks** across Contexts (same word, different sense).
* **Illicit arithmetic** (e.g., averaging ordinals, mixing units).
* **Hidden normalizations** that silently change polarity or scale.
* **Unverifiable aggregation** (no proof obligations, no Γ‑fold hooks).
* **Unreusable outputs** (no UTS rows, no test surface, no scope).

---

### 4) Forces

* **Pluralism vs. uniformity.** Preserve school‑specific semantics yet deliver a common **typing** substrate.
* **Expressiveness vs. parsimony.** Reuse existing U.Types (F.8) vs. mint new ones with justification.
* **Pedagogy vs. formalism.** Make authoring teachable (Name Cards, micro‑examples) without weakening the legality guards.
* **Local context vs. portability.** Keep CHR **Context‑local** while preparing **Bridges** with **CL** and explicit **loss notes**.

---

### 5) Solution — *CHR Authoring chassis* (S1–S8)

**S1 · Measurement Charter (scope anchor)**
**Inputs:** CG-FrameContext (G.1), SoTA Pack (G.2).  CAL traces supporting SoTAPaletteDescription MUST identify KD‑CAL lanes used (TA / LA / VA) and expose any lane‑dependent tolerances. Cross‑lane comparisons are forbidden unless explicitly bridged with declared CL penalties.
**Ops:** declare **ObjectKinds** and **TaskKinds** in the home **Context**; state **USM ScopeSlice(G)**, invariants, and **freshness** needs; list contested terms that require Bridges.
**Outputs:** `KindMap@Context`, `MeasurementCharter` (design‑time stance).
**Guards:** A.4 split; F.1–F.3 Contexting; E.10 lexical hygiene.

**S2 · Term Minting & Reuse (UTS‑first)**
**Ops:** for each candidate term, attempt **reuse** (F.8) via UTS; if minting, draft **Name Card** (Unified + Plain), Context, MDS, twin labels, and **loss notes** for any Bridge.
**Outputs:** `UTS.Drafts{Characteristic,Scale,Level,Coordinate}` with ids.
**Guards:** No global claims; Bridges carry **CL** (F.9).

**S3 · Characteristic Cards (the core unit)**
**Template (normative fields):**
`CharacteristicCard := ⟨UTS.id, Context, ObjectKind, Intent, Definition (typed), **ObservableOf ⟨instrument/protocol, uncertainty model, validity window⟩**, EvidenceLanes (KD‑CAL), ScaleRef, Polarity ∈ {↑, ↓, ⊥}, Domain/Range, UnitSet, Freshness/Half‑life, Missingness semantics, Reliability/Stability notes, Micro‑examples⟩`
**Rules:** Definition references **MM‑CHR**; **Polarity** explicit; **UnitSet** coherent; **Missingness** classified (MCAR / MAR / MNAR, or local equivalents with mapping).
**Outputs:** `CHR.Characteristic[]` (if used in any **CG‑Spec**, the **CG‑Spec.characteristics\[] id** MUST be referenced here).

**S4 · Scales & Levels (lawful measurement)**
**ScaleCard:** `⟨type ∈ {nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio, count, cyclic,…}, admissibleTransforms (group), unit(s), resolution, bounds, zero semantics⟩`.
**LevelCard (for nominal/ordinal):** `⟨enumeration, partial/total order, ties policy⟩`.
**Rules:**

* **Nominal:** only equality, counting by category; transforms = permutations.
* **Ordinal:** order‑preserving transforms only; **no** addition/subtraction; medians allowed; quantiles allowed.
* **Boolean:** treated as **nominal with two levels**; only equality and counts; transforms = permutations.
* **Count:** non‑negative integers; addition allowed; **do not** assume ratio‑scale unless exposure/time base is fixed and declared; declare rate conversions explicitly.
* **Interval:** positive affine transforms; differences meaningful; means allowed.
* **Ratio:** positive scalar transforms; ratios and products allowed.
* **Cyclic:** operations respect wrap‑around; define principal interval.
  **Outputs:** `CHR.Scale[]`, `CHR.Level[]`.

**S5 · Coordinates & Encodings (without hidden cardinalization; state preserved invariants and non‑entitlements per A.18 CSLC)**
When a numeric **Coordinate** is required (e.g., for ranking), publish `CoordinatePolicy` with: mapping, invariants preserved (order/ratio/etc.), **what operations remain illegal**, and **proof obligations** if stronger structure is claimed.
**Examples:** isotonic embeddings for ordinal (order‑only), log‑scale coordinates for ratio positives, circular coordinates for cyclic.
**Outputs:** `CHR.Coordinate[]` + legality annotations.
**Guards:** Coordinate **does not** upgrade scale type without evidence; illegal ops remain blocked.
**Note:** if a Characteristic participates in any **CG‑Spec** characteristic, reference the characteristic id in the card.

**S6 · Operation Legality & Guard Macros** (explicitly forbid mean/subtract on ordinal; fail unit mismatches)
Publish a **Legality Matrix** per Scale type and a set of **Guard Macros** for CAL/LOG:
`ORD_COMPARE_ONLY`, `INTERVAL_MEAN_ALLOWED`, `RATIO_PRODUCT_ALLOWED`, `UNIT_CHECK`, `CROSS_Context_CL_PENALTY`, `POLARITY_CHECK`, `CYCLIC_DIFF`.
**Outputs:** `CHR.Guards`, `CHR.LegalityMatrix`.
**Guards:** Enforce at authoring time + RSCR; route cross‑Context penalties to **R_eff** (never to **F**).

**S7 · Aggregation & Comparison Patterns (safe by construction)**
Provide **typed aggregation templates** (e.g., lexicographic min, Pareto dominance with explicit **non‑dominated set** outputs for partial orders, **t‑norms only on ratio‑scale quantities in \[0,1]**, medoid/median for ordinal, affine sums only on interval/ratio with unit alignment). Any comparator/aggregator used **across candidates** MUST cite a **CG‑Spec** characteristic id (A.19.D1); otherwise degrade to order‑only or abstain.
**Outputs:** `CHR.AggregationSpecs` with legality proofs/links.

**S8 · Publication, Tests, and Evolution**
Publish all artifacts to **UTS** (with twin labels and Bridges); register **RSCR** tests: unit coherence, guard coverage, polarity invariants, illegal‑op refusal. Provide **Worked‑Examples** and a **Refresh Plan** (ageing/decay → B.3.4).
**Outputs:** versioned `CHR Pack@CG-Frame` + RSCR ids + deprecation notices (F.13).
**Guards:** E.5.\* no tool lock‑in; lexical continuity (F.13–F.14).

### 7) Payload (what G.3 exports)

1. **CHR Pack\@CG-Frame** (folder):

   * `CHR.Characteristic[]` (Cards)
   * `CHR.Scale[]`, `CHR.Level[]`
   * `CHR.Coordinate[]` (with legality notes)
   * `CHR.Guards`, `CHR.LegalityMatrix`
   * `CHR.AggregationSpecs`
   * **UTS Entries** (Name Cards + twin labels + Bridge CL & loss notes)
   * **RSCR** tests + **Worked‑Examples**
2. **Hand‑off manifests** to G.4 (admissible CAL operators; unit/scale constraints) and to G.5 (TaskSignature trait inferences; eligibility predicates).

---

### 8) Conformance Checklist (normative)

1. **Context declared.** Every CHR artifact has a **home Context**; cross‑Context reuse uses a **Bridge** with **CL** and **loss note**.
2. **Scale typed.** Each Characteristic declares **Scale type**, **Polarity**, **UnitSet**, **Bounds**, **Zero semantics**, **Freshness**.
3. **ObservableOf filled.** Each CharacteristicCard declares `ObservableOf` with instrument/protocol and uncertainty.
4. **CG‑Spec link.** If a Characteristic is used as a **CG‑Spec** characteristic, the characteristic id is referenced.
5. **Legality explicit.** A **Legality Matrix** and **Guard Macros** exist and are referenced by all downstream operators.
6. **No illegal ops.** Ordinal **SHALL NOT** be averaged/subtracted; unit mismatches **SHALL** fail fast (A.17–A.19/C.16).
7. **Coordinates honest.** Numeric encodings **SHALL** state what invariants they preserve and **SHALL NOT** silently upgrade measurement structure.
8. **Aggregation proven.** Published aggregation specs come with **proof obligations** (monotonicity, idempotence, boundary) or a rationale for weaker claims.
9. **UTS‑ready.** Names minted or reused; **twin labels** present; **loss notes** attached where bridged (F.17–F.18, F.9).
10. **Evidence wired.** Each Characteristic links to **R‑anchors** (KD‑CAL lanes) and **Worked‑Examples**.
11. **RSCR passing.** Tests enforce guards (ordinal arithmetic refusal, unit coherence, polarity checks, cyclic wrap rules).
12. **Design/run split.** Authoring is **design‑time**; run‑time policies live in CAL/LOG (A.4).
13. **No tool lock‑in.** Core cards avoid vendor keywords; implementations live under **E.5.\***.
14. **Lifecycle set.** Refresh/decay declared; deprecations follow **F.13–F.14** with **Lexical Continuity** notes.

---

### 9) Anti‑patterns & rewrites

* **Hidden cardinalization.** *Don’t:* treat ordinal encodings as interval; *Do:* publish an **isotonic** coordinate with clear limits.
* **Unit laundering.** *Don’t:* add cost (USD) to time (hours); *Do:* transform to lawful quantities or keep vector comparisons.
* **Global definitions.** *Don’t:* one “utility” for all Contexts; *Do:* Context‑local Characteristics with Bridges + CL.
* **Aggregation by convenience.** *Don’t:* “weighted averages” on ordinals; *Do:* medians, majority order, or lexicographic rules with proofs.
* **Design/run blur.** *Don’t:* bake policy thresholds into Scale definitions; *Do:* keep thresholds in CAL acceptance clauses.

---

### 10) Consequences

* **Safety by construction.** Illegal operations are blocked at the **type/guard** level.
* **Comparable plurality.** Rival schools can co‑exist because CHR preserves **local meaning** and exposes **lawful** comparison.
* **Frictionless downstream.** CAL (G.4) and Dispatcher (G.5) receive **typed, UTS‑published** primitives with RSCR tests.

---

### 11) Worked micro‑example (indicative)

*CG-Frame:* R\&D portfolio decisions.
**Objects:** `Project`. **Characteristics:**

1. `SafetyClass` — **ordinal**, Levels = {D,C,B,A,AA} (↑ better), admissible transforms = **order‑preserving**, **aggregation** default = **lexicographic min** across subsystems; **Coordinate** = isotonic map (order only).
2. `CostUSD_2025` — **ratio**, unit = USD (2025 real), admissible = positive scalar; allowed ops: +, × by scalar; **aggregation** = sum after **unit alignment**.
3. `Readiness` — **nominal**, Levels = {lab, pilot, field}; ops = equality, counts; no ordering unless a Bridge provides one with **CL** and loss note.
   **Guards:** `ORD_COMPARE_ONLY(SafetyClass)`, `UNIT_CHECK(CostUSD_2025)`.
   **UTS:** Name Cards minted; twin label “Safety rating” with loss note for marketing Context Bridge.
   **RSCR:** tests refuse `mean(SafetyClass)`; accept `median(SafetyClass)`; fail `CostUSD + Readiness`.

---

### 12) Relations

**Builds on:** G.1, G.2; **MM‑CHR** (A.17–A.19/C.16); **F–G–R**; **Contexts/Bridges + CL**; **UTS**; **RoleAssignment**.
**Publishes to:** G.4 (CAL admissible operators, legality macros), G.5 (TaskSignature traits), **UTS**, RSCR, Worked‑Examples.
**Constrains:** any CAL/LOG implementation that consumes CHR.

---

### 13) Author’s quick checklist

1. Write the **Measurement Charter** and **KindMap** for the CG-Frame.
2. For each candidate Characteristic, **reuse** or **mint** in UTS with Name Card + twin labels.
3. Declare **Scale**, **Levels**, **Polarity**, **UnitSet**, **Bounds**, **Freshness**, **Evidence lanes**.
4. Publish any **Coordinate** with invariants preserved and explicit **non‑entitlements**.
5. Generate **Legality Matrix** + **Guard Macros**; wire **AggregationSpecs** with proofs.
6. Emit **RSCR** tests and **Worked‑Examples**; version the **CHR Pack**; set refresh/decay.

## G.4 — **CAL Authoring: Calculi · Acceptance · Evidence** \[A]

**Tag:** \[A] (publishes CAL; consumes CHR; constrains LOG & G.5)
**Stage:** *design‑time* (authoring & publication; enables lawful run‑time evaluation)
**Primary hooks:** G.1 CG-Frame Card; G.2 SoTA Synthesis Pack; **G.3 CHR Pack**; **G.5 Dispatcher**; **KD‑CAL F–G–R** (B.3, B.1 Γ‑fold); **MM‑CHR discipline** (A.17–A.19/C.16); **Contexts & Bridges + CL** (F.1–F.3, F.9); **UTS & naming** (F.17–F.18); **RoleAssignment** (F.4); **RSCR** (F.15); **E/E‑LOG** (C.19); **No tool lock‑in** (E.5.1–E.5.3); **Lexical rules** (E.10); **Design–Run split** (A.4).

---

### 1) Intent

Provide a **notation‑independent authoring discipline** to turn CHR‑typed measurement (from **G.3**) and SoTA plurality (from **G.2**) into a **lawful calculus layer (CAL)**:

* **Operators** (transform, compare, aggregate, optimize, decide),
* **Acceptance Clauses** (typed predicates for *fit‑for‑purpose*), and
* **Evidence wiring** (F–G–R lanes, Γ‑fold integration, CL routing),

so that run‑time **LOG** bundles and the **G.5** selector can execute choices **safely, audibly, and with scope/trust visible**.

---

### 2) Context

You have a **CG-FrameContext** (G.1), a **SoTA Synthesis Pack** (G.2), and a **CHR Pack** (G.3) with Characteristics/Scales/Levels/Coordinates and **Guard Macros**. Before any method is dispatched (G.5), the **CAL layer** must specify *what operators exist*, *what they legally do over the CHR types*, and *what counts as acceptable outcomes under declared scope (G) and assurance (F–R)*.

---

### 3) Problem

Teams repeatedly face:

* **Illicit operations** (hidden cardinalization; unit laundering; ordinal arithmetic).
* **Opaque acceptance** (thresholds scattered; no typed predicates; no Γ‑fold).
* **Unstated assumptions** (regularity, noise, independence) that break comparability.
* **Evidence ambiguity** (what lane? how to aggregate? where do CL penalties land?).
* **Tool entanglement** (vendor flags baked into core logic).

---

### 4) Forces

* **Power vs. safety.** Expressive operators vs. strict legality under **MM‑CHR**.
* **Pluralism vs. unification.** Preserve school‑specific calculi vs. a common **typed** substrate.
* **Pedagogy vs. proof burden.** Make acceptance teachable while binding **proof obligations**.
* **Locality vs. portability.** Keep Context‑local semantics yet prepare **Bridges** (with **CL** and loss notes).
* **Exploration vs. exploitation.** Enable **NQD/E‑E** probing without leaking un‑assured results.

---

### 5) Solution — *CAL Authoring chassis* (C1–C9)

**C1 · CAL Charter (scope anchor)**
**Inputs:** CG-FrameContext (G.1), SoTA Pack (G.2), CHR Pack (G.3). CAL traces supporting SoTAPaletteDescription MUST identify KD‑CAL lanes used (TA / LA / VA) and expose any lane‑dependent tolerances. Cross‑lane comparisons are forbidden unless an explicit **Bridge** with declared **CL** and loss notes is provided; penalties route to **R_eff** only.
**Ops:** declare **TaskKinds** and **ObjectKinds** *in the home Context*; state **assumption envelopes** (data shape, noise, independence, stationarity), **USM ScopeSlice(G)**, and **evidence lanes** intended per KD‑CAL (e.g., TA/LA/VA);  enumerate intended **CG‑Spec** characteristics if any comparison/aggregation will be performed in this CAL pack.
**Outputs:** `CAL.Charter@Context` (design‑time stance) + `TaskMap`.
**Guards:** A.4 split; F.1–F.3 Contexting; E.10 lexical hygiene.

Any cross‑school or cross‑lane reduction MUST declare a CL bridge with explicit loss notes. Such reductions contribute a penalty term to Γ‑fold and are ineligible for “universal” aggregation.

**C2 · Operator Cards (typed & lawful)**
Define **OperatorCard** as the core unit:

```
OperatorCard :=
⟨ UTS.id, Context, Lineage/School, Intent,
  Signature: X → Y over CHR types,
  Preconditions (typed; Guard Macros),
  Postconditions (typed; invariants),
  Evidence lanes used (KD‑CAL),
  Complexity/Cost cues,
  Failure modes & safe degradations,
  Micro‑examples, Bridges (+CL, loss notes) if any ⟩
  CG‑Spec refs: ids of CG‑Spec characteristics used for any comparison/aggregation.
```

*Signatures* reference **CHR** types (Characteristics/Scales/Units/Coordinates).
**Guards:** `UNIT_CHECK`, `ORD_COMPARE_ONLY`, `POLARITY_CHECK`, `CYCLIC_DIFF`, etc. from **G.3**.
**Outputs:** `CAL.Operator[]` (versioned; UTS‑published with twin labels).

---

**C3 · Acceptance Clauses (typed predicates)**
Craft **AcceptanceClause** as a minimal, typed grammar:

```
AcceptanceClause :=
⟨ ClauseId (UTS), applies_to: {TaskKind|OperatorId},
  Pred := boolean formula over CHR-typed observables
          + CAL outcomes + Scope(G) + Resource envelope,
  Thresholds declared (Context-local),
  Dependence on evidence lanes (KD‑CAL),
  Failure policy (degrade/abstain/escalate) ⟩
```

*Thresholds live here*, **not** inside CHR. Clauses are **design‑time** artifacts that run at selection/evaluation time.
**Outputs:** `CAL.Acceptance[]` (publish to UTS).
**Guards:** **No global thresholds**; cross‑Context reuse via **Bridge + CL** only.
"**Rule:** thresholds **live only in AcceptanceClauses**; if a clause induces comparison/aggregation, cite the CG‑Spec characteristic id; otherwise degrade to order‑only or **abstain**."
**UnknownHandling:** predicates **MUST** define behavior for `unknown` (from TaskSignature/CHR Missingness) and record it in SCR; default **SHALL NOT** coerce to numeric 0/−∞.

**C4 · Aggregation & Comparison Flows (safe by construction)**
Compose operators via **FlowSpecs** with legality checks:

```
FlowSpec := DAG of OperatorIds
  + Admissible Aggregators (from CHR.AggregationSpecs)
  + Γ-fold hints for R-aggregation
  + Unit/scale checks at each edge
```

Provide **typed templates** (lexicographic, Pareto with explicit **non‑dominated set** output, t‑norms, medoid/median, affine sums for interval/ratio only with unit alignment). **If only a partial order is lawful, the Flow returns a set, not a forced scalarization.**

**Outputs:** `CAL.Flow[]` + legality proofs/links.
**Guards:** Ordinal **MUST NOT** be averaged/subtracted; unit mismatches **fail fast**.

---

**C5 · Evidence Wiring & Γ‑fold (R aggregation)** (declare **TA/LA/VA lanes + Aboutness‑E0 fields readable to SCR; Γ = weakest‑link unless proven otherwise)
For each Operator/Flow, define **EvidenceProfile**:

```
EvidenceProfile :=
⟨ lanes ∈ KD‑CAL[], anchors (A.10 carriers),
  contribution to R via Γ-fold,
  CL penalties routing (to R_eff; never to F),
  ageing/decay policy (B.3.4) ⟩
```

Ship a **default Γ‑fold = weakest‑link**, overridable with proof of monotonicity & boundary behavior.
**Outputs:** `CAL.EvidenceProfiles` + **SCR** fields to be emitted at run‑time.

---

**C6 · NQD Operators & Explore↔Exploit Policy Surface**
Where the CG-Frame needs search/generation, define **NQD‑class** operators with explicit:

* **Portfolio coverage** obligations (C.18).
* **Risk budgets** and **probe accounting** under **E/E‑LOG**.
* **Emission trace** schema (who/why/where → VariantPool metadata for G.1/M3).

**Outputs:** `CAL.NQD[]` + policy knobs the **G.5 selector** can read.
**Guards:** Probes **MUST** respect AcceptanceClauses; unsafe probes **MUST** abstain or sandbox.

---

**C7 · Proof Obligations & Soundness Ledger**
For each Operator/Flow/Acceptance, attach **obligations**:

* **Measurement legality** (scale/unit/polarity),
* **Monotonicity / idempotence / stability** of aggregators,
* **Assumption checks** (e.g., independence, convexity),
* **Degradation conditions** (when to drop to ordinal or abstain) and **tie‑handling rules** for partial orders (why a set is returned).

Log proofs or references; if empirical, bind to **KD‑CAL lanes** and **A.10 carriers**.
**Outputs:** `CAL.ProofLedger` (linked from UTS).
**Guards:** Missing proofs **MUST** be visible in **SCR** (severity affects **R**, not **F**).

---

**C8 · Publication, RSCR, and Bridges**
Publish all CAL artifacts to **UTS** (with twin labels; Context noted; Bridges + CL + loss notes). Register **RSCR** tests:

* Refuse illegal ops (e.g., `mean(ordinal)`),
* Enforce **Guard Macros**,
* Check Flow unit/scale coherence,
* Verify **AcceptanceClause** semantics on Worked‑Examples.

**Outputs:** `CAL Pack@CG-Frame` + RSCR ids + Worked‑Examples + deprecation notices (F.13).
**Guards:** E.5.\* (no tool lock‑in); lexical continuity (F.12/F.14).

---

**C9 · Packaging & Refresh**
Version the CAL pack; set **refresh cadence** (evidence decay, probe telemetry, SoTA deltas). Track change‑impact to AcceptanceClauses and Flows; emit **deprecation** and **lexical continuity** notes.
**Outputs:** Versioned `CAL‑Pkg@CG-Frame` + refresh hooks.
**Guards:** A.4 temporal duality; B.4 change rationale logged in **DRR**/**SCR**.

---

### 6) Interfaces — minimal I/O contract

| Interface             | Consumes                                 | Produces                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **G.4‑1 Charter**     | CG-FrameContext (G.1), SoTA Pack (G.2), CHR | `CAL.Charter@Context`, `TaskMap`                                                     |
| **G.4‑2 Operators**   | CHR types, SoTA operator inventory (G.2) | `CAL.Operator[]` (UTS ids; legality guards; EvidenceProfiles)                     |
| **G.4‑3 Acceptance**  | TaskMap, policy intents, CHR guards      | `CAL.Acceptance[]` (typed clauses; thresholds; failure policies)                  |
| **G.4‑4 Flows**       | Operators, CHR AggregationSpecs          | `CAL.Flow[]` (typed pipelines; Γ‑fold hints; legality proofs)                     |
| **G.4‑5 NQD Surface** | CHR types, E/E‑LOG policy                | `CAL.NQD[]` (emitters; risk budgets; telemetry schema)                            |
| **G.4‑6 Publish**     | All above                                | Versioned `CAL Pack@CG-Frame`, RSCR tests, Worked‑Examples, Bridges/CL, deprecations |

---

### 7) Payload (what G.4 exports)

1. **CAL Pack\@CG-Frame** (folder):

   * `CAL.Operator[]` (cards, signatures, guards)
   * `CAL.Acceptance[]` (typed clauses)
   * `CAL.Flow[]` (composition with legality checks)
   * `CAL.EvidenceProfiles` + **Γ‑fold** annotations
   * `CAL.NQD[]` (if applicable)
   * `CAL.ProofLedger`
   * **UTS entries** (Name Cards, twin labels, Bridges + CL/loss notes)
   * **RSCR** tests + **Worked‑Examples**
2. **Hand‑off manifests** to **G.5** (Eligibility contracts derive from Operator/Flow preconditions; Acceptance as selector gates; Evidence to **SCR**).

---

### 8) Conformance Checklist (normative)

1. **Context declared.** Every CAL artifact has a **home Context**; cross‑Context reuse requires **Bridge + CL + loss note**.
2. **Typed throughout.** Signatures, predicates, and flows **MUST** use **CHR** types (Characteristics/Scales/Units/Coordinates).
3. **Legality enforced.** **Guard Macros** from **G.3** are attached and **RSCR‑tested**; ordinal arithmetic **MUST NOT** be performed.
4. **CG‑Spec cited.** Any operator/flow/acceptance that induces comparison/aggregation cites the **CG‑Spec** characteristic id; otherwise degrade/abstain; **partial orders MAY produce a Pareto set**.
5. **Acceptance explicit.** All thresholds/policies live in **AcceptanceClauses**, not in CHR or Operator definitions.
6. **Evidence wired.** Each Operator/Flow declares lanes and anchors; **CL penalties** route to **R_eff** only (not **F**).
7. **Γ‑fold recorded.** R aggregation rule (default **weakest‑link**) is stated; contributors appear in **SCR**.
8. **Degradation safe.** When assumptions fail, flows **MUST** degrade (e.g., cardinal→ordinal) or **abstain**, never perform illegal ops.
9. **No tool lock‑in.** No vendor keywords in core fields; implementations live under **E.5.\***.
10. **Lifecycle set.** Refresh/decay declared; deprecations follow **F.13–F.14** with **Lexical Continuity** notes.
11. **UTS‑ready.** Names minted/reused; twin labels present; **Worked‑Examples** attached.

---

### 9) Anti‑patterns & rewrites

* **Hidden thresholds.** *Don’t:* bake policy cut‑offs into CHR or code; *Do:* publish **AcceptanceClause** with Context‑local thresholds.
* **Operator without signature.** *Don’t:* “score(x)” with implicit units; *Do:* declare `Signature: Project × SafetyClass(ord) × CostUSD(ratio) → {ord, ratio,…}` and guards.
* **Globalized flows.** *Don’t:* reuse an optimization flow across Contexts without Bridge; *Do:* declare **Bridge + CL** and attach loss notes.
* **Evidence blur.** *Don’t:* cite “validated” without lane; *Do:* mark **KD‑CAL** lane(s) + anchors and Γ‑fold effect.
* **Design/run blur.** *Don’t:* trigger side effects inside selection; *Do:* keep selection pure (G.5), evaluation emits **DRR/SCR**.

---

### 10) Consequences

* **Safety by construction.** Illegal operations are blocked; acceptance becomes auditable.
* **Comparable plurality.** Rival calculi co‑exist as separate **Operator/Flow** families with explicit Bridges and **CL**.
* **Frictionless dispatch.** **G.5** reads typed **Eligibility** from CAL preconditions and gates by **AcceptanceClauses** with **SCR** ready.
* **Pedagogical clarity.** Operator/Acceptance cards + Worked‑Examples make the calculus teachable and inspectable.

---

### 11) Worked micro‑example (indicative)

*CG-Frame:* **R\&D portfolio decisions** (same as G.1/G.3 for continuity).
**CHR recap:** `SafetyClass` (ordinal ↑), `CostUSD_2025` (ratio), `Readiness` (nominal).

**Operators:**

* `DominatesPareto : Project×Project → bool` over ⟨↓CostUSD, ↑SafetyClass⟩ with `ORD_COMPARE_ONLY(SafetyClass)` + `UNIT_CHECK(CostUSD)`; lane = **LA**.
* `BudgetFeasible : Portfolio → bool` with unit‑aligned sum; lane = **LA/VA**.
* `LexiMinSafety : Portfolio → SafetyClass` (aggregator = lexicographic min); lane = **LA**.

**AcceptanceClauses:**

* `AC_SafetyGate`: *must meet* `SafetyClass ≥ B` (ordinal predicate; Context‑local levels).
* `AC_Budget`: `TotalCostUSD_2025 ≤ Envelope`.
* `AC_Explain`: DRR must cite top‑3 trade‑offs; lane = **VA** for exemplars.

**Flows:**

* `Flow_SelectPareto`: filter by `AC_Budget ∧ AC_SafetyGate`, compute Pareto front via `DominatesPareto`; Γ‑fold = weakest‑link over **LA/VA**.

**Evidence:**

* CL penalty applied if `SafetyClass` is bridged from a *marketing* Context rating; penalty lowers **R_eff** only; **F** unchanged.

Run‑time: **G.5** reads CAL preconditions/acceptance to form eligibility and gates; emits **DRR+SCR** citing Γ‑fold contributors.

---

### 12) Relations

**Builds on:** G.1, G.2, **G.3**; **MM‑CHR**; **F–G–R / KD‑CAL**; **Contexts/Bridges + CL**; **UTS**; **Role Assignment**.
**Publishes to:** **G.5** (eligibility, acceptance, evidence), **UTS**, **RSCR**, Worked‑Examples.
**Constrains:** any **LOG** implementation that executes these operators/flows.

---

### 13) Author’s quick checklist

1. Write the **CAL Charter** and **TaskMap** for the CG-Frame.
2. For each SoTA operator candidate, author an **OperatorCard** with typed signature, guards, lanes, proofs/anchors.
3. Externalize all thresholds into **AcceptanceClauses**; define failure policies and safe degradations.
4. Assemble **Flows** using CHR‑approved aggregators; attach Γ‑fold hints and legality proofs.
5. Define **EvidenceProfiles** and **CL** routing; ensure **SCR** fields are computable.
6. Publish to **UTS** with twin labels and Bridges; register **RSCR** tests; ship **Worked‑Examples**.
7. Set **refresh/decay**; version the **CAL‑Pkg**; log change impact to **DRR/SCR**.

> **Placement:** G.4 lives between **G.3** (measurement semantics) and **G.5** (multi‑method selection). It is the **calculus contract** that makes run‑time choice **lawful, explainable, and scoped**.


## G.5 — **Multi‑Method Dispatcher & MethodFamily Registry** \[A]

**Tag:** \[A] (uses CHR/CAL/LOG)
**Stage:** *design‑time* (authoring & registration) with a *run‑time* selector facade (policy‑governed)
**Primary hooks:** G.1 CG-Frame Card, G.2 SoTA Synthesis Pack, G.3 CHR authoring, G.4 CAL variants, **KD‑CAL F–G–R** (B.3), **Formality F** (C.2.3), **USM / Scope (G)** (A.2.6), **Bounded Contexts & Bridges with CL** (Part F + B‑patterns), **SCR/RSCR** (F.15), **NQD‑CAL** (C.18), **E/E‑LOG** (C.19), **UTS & Naming** (F.17–F.18), **Guard‑Rails E.5.1–E.5.3** (no tool lock‑in, unidirectional dependency).

---

### 1) Intent

Provide a **notation‑independent** architecture to register **families of methods** (LOG bundles) and to **select, combine, or fall back** among them for a concrete problem instance—*given typed characteristics (CHR), admissible calculi (CAL), and trust constraints (F–G–R).* The pattern embraces **No‑Free‑Lunch** realities: *there is no universal best method*, so selection is **trait‑ and evidence‑aware**, under explicit **explore↔exploit** policy. 

---

### 2) Context

You have executed **G.1** (CG-Frame Card) and **G.2** (SoTA Synthesis Pack), which surfaced **rival schools and operator palettes**. **G.3/G.4** produced *candidate* CHR/CAL content. You now need a **registry and dispatcher** that:
(a) keeps schools **disjoint** yet comparable; (b) chooses a **method family** at run time from typed evidence **without collapsing semantics** across Contexts; (c) publishes names and obligations to **UTS**. 

---

### 3) Problem

How to design a **general, auditable selector** that:

* prefers **well‑matched** methods for a task instance (shape, noise, constraints) *without* hard‑coding an algorithmic dogma;
* respects **Bounded Contexts**, using **Bridges + CL** only when crossing (with penalties routed to **R**, never **F**);
* explains *why* a choice was made and **how much trust** it buys (F–G–R) with a **SCR**;
* remains free of **tooling jargon** and **implementation bias** at the Core level.   

---

### 4) Forces

* **Pluralism vs. dispatchability.** Competing schools expose different invariants; the selector must compare **without semantic flattening**.
* **Evidence vs. formality.** **F** shapes expression rigor; **R** tracks support; **G** is scope—**orthogonal** yet interacting under composition. 
* **Local semantics vs. reuse.** Cross‑Context reuse requires **Bridges** with **CL** and **loss notes**; penalties hit **R_eff**, not F. 
* **Exploration vs. exploitation.** Run‑time must sometimes **probe alternatives** (NQD/E‑E), but within declared **risk envelopes**.

---

### 5) Solution — *Dispatcher & Registry chassis*

**S1 · MethodFamily Registry (design‑time, per CG-Frame)**
Define a **registry row** per *MethodFamily* (e.g., *Outranking*, *CDT*, *Active‑Inference*, *Pareto‑front MOMAs*, *Gradient‑based optimizer*, *RL policy search*), each row comprising:

* **Identity:** local Context, lineage/school, version, **UTS name card**;
* **Eligibility contract** (typed): required **Object/Task kinds**, **Data shape/regularity traits**, **Noise/uncertainty model**, **Resource envelope**, **Scope prerequisites** (USM claims), **Evidence lanes per KD‑CAL** (e.g., VA/LA/TA) it relies on; **predicates MUST support tri‑state {true|false|unknown} and define a failure policy for `unknown` (degrade/abstain/sandbox)**;
* **Assurance profile:** **I/D/S** of the method artefact (e.g., `MethodDescription` vs `MethodSpec` per E.10.D2), **Formality F** anchored to **U.Formality** scale **F0…F9** (C.2.3), expected **R** lane(s), **CL** allowances for cross‑Context operation; **CL penalties SHALL route to R_eff only**;

* **Cost/complexity** cues and failure modes;
* **Proof obligations** (what must be established before/after selection).
* **Artefacts:** list **MethodDescription** ids (UTS); where harnessed, also **MethodSpec** ids; cross‑Context reuse requires Bridges + CL.
  All fields are **Core‑level concepts**; concrete notations live in Tooling per **E.5.1–E.5.3**. Publish to **UTS** with twin labels and loss notes if bridged. 

**S2 · TaskSignature & Trait Inference (design‑time + run‑time)**
A **TaskSignature** is a *minimal typed record* the dispatcher consumes:
`⟨Context, TaskKind, ObjectKinds, DataShape, NoiseModel, ObjectiveProfile, Constraints, ScopeSlice(G), EvidenceAnchors, Size/Scale, Freshness, Missingness⟩`.
Values are **CHR‑typed** (Characteristics/Scales/Levels/Coordinates per MM‑CHR discipline) with provenance. Traits may be **inferred** from CHR/CAL bindings (e.g., *convexity known? differentiable? ordinal vs interval scales?*) and from **USM** scope metadata.
**UnknownHandling:** all fields admit `unknown` (tri‑state {true|false|unknown}); **Missingness semantics MUST align with CHR.Missingness** (MCAR/MAR/MNAR or mapped equivalents) and be honored by Acceptance/Flows.

**S3 · Selection Kernel (run‑time, policy‑governed)**
No‑Free‑Lunch is enforced by the Selector: choose School/Operator sets from the SoTAPaletteDescription conditioned on task/object/CHR preconditions, rather than by “universal” cross‑school formulas in CG‑Spec. Selector decisions MUST cite palette entries and CHR/CAL constraints used.

The selector MUST:
(1) read SoTAPaletteDescription,
(2) filter Schools by CHR preconditions and KD‑CAL lane fit,
(3) pick operators consistent with declared scales and taboos,
(4) emit a rationale with links to palette entries and Worked Examples.
CG‑Spec MUST NOT override this with one‑size‑fits‑all formulas.

A **pure selector** computes a **CandidateSet** with an **admissible (possibly partial) order** (no illegal cross‑scale scoring) and constrained by an *AssuranceGate*:

1. **Eligibility filter:** `MethodFamily` passes iff all **Eligibility contract** predicates hold **and** all **CG‑Spec.MinimalEvidence** gates for referenced characteristics are met; **if CG‑Frame uses NQD, enforce `ConstraintFit=pass` before front selection**; otherwise **abstain/sandbox**.
2. **CG‑Spec gate:** require all **CHR characteristics** referenced by Acceptance/Flows to meet the **CG‑Spec.minimal_evidence** in the current Context; otherwise **abstain** or sandbox under E/E‑LOG.
3. **Admissible preference:** apply **lexicographic** precedence over lawful traits (e.g., *assumption fit* ≻ *evidence alignment* ≻ *resource/cost*). **Weighted sums across mixed scale types (ordinal vs interval/ratio) are forbidden**; prefer lexicographic/medoid/median where lawful.
4. **F–G–R aware gating:** compute **R_eff** with **Γ‑fold** (default = weakest‑link; **override only if CAL/EvidenceProfile supplies an alternative with proofs of monotonicity & boundary behavior**) and apply **CL** penalties (R_eff only; F and G invariant); block candidates failing *minimum R*; **record Γ‑fold contributors explicitly in SCR**. **F** is read from method formalisation level; **G** from **USM** slice; penalties **never alter F**. 
5. **Partial‑order handling:** if after gating the order is not total, **return a Pareto (non‑dominated) set** and explain tie‑criteria in DRR/SCR; do not force a total order via illegal scalarization.
6. **Explore↔Exploit policy:** under **E/E‑LOG**, admit a quota of **NQD‑emitted** alternatives (guarded by risk budgets) to avoid local optima; log probes and outcomes for **refresh**.

**S4 · Composition & Fallbacks (design‑time templates)**
Provide templates for **composed strategies**: (i) *pre‑conditioners* (e.g., rescale/denoise), (ii) *meta‑selectors* (e.g., *small‑n* vs *large‑n* switch), (iii) *cascade fallbacks* on **Assurance failure** (e.g., degrade objective from cardinal to ordinal when CHR forbids interval arithmetic). Guard with **unit/scale legality** rules from CHR; **disallow illegal ordinal arithmetic**.
Add a **Verifier stage**: on run‑time preconditions failing or **evidence freshness** expiring, trigger the next lawful fallback; emit DRR/SCR deltas.

**S5 · Publication & Telemetry**
Each selection produces a **Decision Rationale Record (DRR)** + **SCR**, citing chosen family, **why**, **CG‑Spec characteristics consulted and MinimalEvidence verdicts (per characteristic & lane)**, **Γ‑fold contributors**, **CL penalties**, expected **R_eff**, and any **explore** probes. Register the family and selection policy to **UTS** **with twin labels and loss notes where bridged**; wire **RSCR** tests for regression. **Log on‑policy outcomes and off‑policy regret estimates** to support registry refresh.

**S6 · Governance & Evolution**

* **Unidirectional dependency:** Registry and selector are Core patterns; implementations are Tooling; tutorials are Pedagogy.
* **Change control:** versioned entries; deprecations flow through **Lexical Continuity** and **Worked‑Examples** refresh.

> **Julia‑style specialisation (design idiom).** Use **trait‑like dispatch** and **parametric specialisation** *at the level of typed contracts*, not code, to keep selection semantics **portable** across languages and stacks. The Core remains **notation‑independent**.

### 6) Interfaces — minimal I/O contract

| Interface                | Consumes                                                | Produces                                                                      |

### 7) Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑G5.0** Core contracts **SHALL** remain notation‑independent; vendor/tool keywords are forbidden in eligibility or assurance fields (E.5.1–E.5.3).
**CC‑G5.1** Every `MethodFamily` **SHALL** declare an **Eligibility contract** using CHR terms; contracts **SHALL NOT** rely on tool‑specific keywords.
**CC‑G5.2** Selection **SHALL** be a **pure function** of `TaskSignature` + policy; side effects limited to DRR/SCR emission.
**CC‑G5.3** Cross‑Context use **MUST** cite a **Bridge** with **CL**; penalties **MUST** flow to **R_eff**; **F** and **G** remain invariant; **attach a loss note**. 
**CC‑G5.4** The selector **MUST** **default** to the **weakest‑link** rule for **R_eff** and record contributors in **SCR**; it **MAY** use an alternative Γ‑fold **only** when provided by CAL with proof obligations satisfied (monotonicity, boundary behavior).
**CC‑G5.5** Ordinal scales **MUST NOT** be averaged/subtracted; unit/scale legality **MUST** be enforced by CHR guards.
**CC‑G5.6** Chosen families **SHALL** be published to **UTS** with twin labels and scope notes; deprecations follow F.13.
**CC‑G5.7** Exploration **MUST** be budgeted under **E/E‑LOG**; probe outcomes **MUST** feed refresh.
**CC‑G5.8** **CG‑Frame gate enforced.** Selection rejects candidates that do not meet **CG‑Spec.minimal_evidence** for the characteristics they use.
**CC‑G5.9** **Admissible ordering.** Candidate ordering **MUST** be lexicographic or otherwise lawful over CHR‑typed traits; **weighted sums across ordinal/interval/ratio mixes are forbidden**. If only a partial order is available, **return a Pareto set**.
**CC‑G5.10** **SCR completeness.** SCR **MUST** enumerate Γ‑fold contributors, **CG‑Spec characteristics** used, and **MinimalEvidence gating verdicts** (by lane & carrier).
**CC‑G5.11** **Tri‑state eligibility.** Eligibility predicates **MUST** define behavior for `unknown` (degrade/abstain/sandbox); silent coercion to `false` is forbidden.
**CC‑G5.12** **No “universal” cross‑school scoring.** Cross‑school selection **MUST NOT** rely on a single numeric formula not justified by CHR/CAL and CG‑Spec.

### 8) Consequences

* **Auditable plurality.** Rivals co‑exist, selected with **explainable** trust and scope handling.
* **Safety by construction.** Illegal measurements and cross‑Context leaks are blocked by contract and CL penalties. 
* **Evolvability.** Families can be **added/retired** without rewriting the selector; UTS provides a stable publication surface.

---

### 9) Worked micro‑examples (indicative)

**9.1 Decision Theory (multi‑school)**
`TaskSignature:` *one‑shot, high‑stakes, observational dataset; causal graph partially known; counterfactuals needed; ordinal preference ordering only in some panels; strict risk constraint.*

* Eligibility filters admit **CDT** (needs counterfactuals), **EDT** (if evidential suffices), **Active‑Inference** (if a generative model with variational free energy is in scope), and **reject cardinal EU** where CHR shows *ordinal‑only* preferences.
* CL appears if a *psychological Context* Bridge is used for utility elicitation; selector applies **CL penalty** to **R_eff** only; **F** remains the method’s declared formalism level. **DRR** explains the choice (CDT) and logs an **NQD** probe of *Active‑Inference* under small budget. 

**9.2 Creativity (portfolio search)**
`TaskSignature:` *wide design space; resource cap; novelty emphasis; diversity quota.*

* Registry offers **Pareto‑front NQD** and **IPO‑style recombiners**; **E/E‑LOG** sets an explore‑heavy policy initially, then shifts to exploit on observed Use‑Value. **SCR** reports that Use‑Value evidence is **LA** lane while novelty scoring rests on **VA** heuristics.

### 10) Relations

**Builds on:** G.1–G.4; **F–G–R / KD‑CAL**; **Formality F**; **USM**; **Bridges & CL**; **Guard‑Rails E.5.\***.    
**Publishes to:** **UTS**, Worked‑Examples, RSCR.
**Constrains:** any run‑time *selector implementations* (Tooling) via the Core contracts.

---

### 11) Editorial notes (authoring guidance)

* Keep **contracts minimal** and **typed**; resist adding tool‑level flags to the Core (route to Tooling Glossaries).
* Treat **composition patterns** as first‑class (preconditioner → solver → verifier); publish each as a **UTS row** with clear Contexts.
* When a selection *raises F* (e.g., recasting acceptance as predicates), record **ΔF** separately from **ΔG/ΔR**.

---

### 12) Quick author checklist

1. Register ≥ 3 **MethodFamilies** per competing school with typed **Eligibility** and **Assurance**.
2. Define the **TaskSignature** schema for the CG-Frame; prove it is **minimal** but **sufficient** for dispatch.
3. Implement **Selection Kernel** as a pure Core algorithm; ensure **CL penalties** and **weakest‑link R** are computed and logged in **SCR**.
4. Publish families and selection policy to **UTS**; add one **Worked‑Example** per policy branch.
5. Wire **RSCR** tests to freeze contracts and prevent silent regressions.

> **Placement:** G.5 lives in **Part G – CG-Frame Extension Kit**, after G.1–G.4. It is the **orchestration hub** that turns SoTA plurality into **auditable run‑time choice** while preserving **local meaning, scope, and trust**.

### **Part K  – Lexical debt**
### Mandatory replacement map for measurement terms

> **Rule:** In all **normative** content (specifications, data schemas, etc.), the deprecated terms **“axis”** and **“dimension”** (and their plural or compound forms) **MUST NOT** be used to denote a measurable aspect. Use **Characteristic** in the Tech register instead. Other colloquial terms should be mapped to canonical terms as listed below. In **Plain** narrative, the legacy words may appear _only on first use_ and only if paired with their canonical equivalent for clarity.

| Legacy Term (context) | **Replace with** (Tech register) | Plain register allowance | Canonical Reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| axis (of measurement); dimension (of a system or quality) | **Characteristic** | “axis” or “dimension” _(only as an introductory parenthetical, e.g. “Characteristic (axis)”)_, thereafter use “Characteristic” | A.17 (CHR-NORM) |
| point (on an axis); data point | **Coordinate** (on a Scale) | “point” _(in explanations only, e.g. “a point on the scale”)_ | A.18 (CSLC-KERNEL) |
| metric value; raw score | **Coordinate** (or **Value**) | “value” _(acceptable in plain usage when context is clear, but formally it’s a Coordinate tied to a Characteristic)_ | A.18, C.16 |
| score (composite or normalized) | **Score** (produced via a **Gauge**) | “score” _(if needed in narrative, ensure it’s explained as a result of a defined Gauge)_ | A.17/A.18 (Gauge/Score) |
| unit dimension; unit axis | **Unit** (of a Scale) | “unit” _(plain usage okay)_ | A.18 (Scale/Unit) |
| metric (as a noun) | **Avoid in Tech and as primitive** → use **`U.MetricTemplate` / `U.Measure` / Score** | “metric” _(Plain only on first use, with pointer to canonical terms)_ | C.16 § 5.1 (L5), A.18 |

## Migration debt from A.2.6 (Scope, ClaimScope, WorkScope)

### Deprecations (normative)

The following terms **MUST NOT** name scope characteristics in normative text, guards, or conformance blocks:

* *applicability*, *envelope*, *generality*, *capability envelope*, *validity* (as a characteristic name).

Use instead:

* **`U.ClaimScope`** (*Claim scope*, nick **G**) for epistemes;
* **`U.WorkScope`** (*Work scope*) for capabilities;
* **`U.Scope`** only when explaining the abstract mechanism (not in guards).

### Affected locations and required edits (normative)

Editors SHALL apply the following replacements:

1. **Part C.2.2 (F–G–R).**

   * Replace any internal definition of “Generality” with a normative reference to **A.2.6 §6.3** (*Claim scope (G)*).
   * Where “abstraction level” is mentioned as G, replace with “Claim scope (where the claim holds)”; keep **AT** (AbstractionTier) only as optional didactics (non‑G).
   * Ensure composition examples use **intersection/SpanUnion** for G, not ordinal “more/less general”.

2. **Part C.2.3 (Formality F).**

   * No change to F itself.
   * Any example that implies “raising F widens G” MUST be rephrased: F changes expression form; G changes only via **ΔG**.

3. **Part A.2.2 (Capabilities).**

   * Replace “capability envelope/applicability” with **`U.WorkScope`**.
   * Method–Work gates MUST test **Work scope covers JobSlice**, with **measures** and **qualification windows** bound.

4. **Part B (Bridges & CL).**

   * Add a note: **CL penalties apply to R**, not to **F/G**; mapping MAY recommend **narrowing** the mapped scope (best practice).

5. **Part E (Lexicon).**

   * Add entries for **Claim scope (G)**, **Work scope**, **Scope** (mechanism).
   * Mark listed deprecated terms as **legacy aliases** allowed only in explanatory notes.

6. **ESG & Method–Work templates.**

   * Replace any “applicability”/“envelope” guard phrasing with **ScopeCoverage** (see §10).
   * Require explicit **`Γ_time`** selectors in all scope‑sensitive guards.

### Migration playbook (informative)

1. **Inventory** scope‑like phrases across your Context (search: applicability, envelope, generality, capability envelope, valid\*).
2. **Classify** each occurrence as **Claim scope** (episteme) or **Work scope** (capability).
3. **Rewrite** guards to use `Scope covers TargetSlice` + explicit **`Γ_time`**; remove “latest”.
4. **Publish** any required **Bridges** with **CL** for Cross‑context usage.
5. **Document** ΔG changes separately from evidence freshness (R).

### Backwards compatibility (informative)

Legacy artifacts MAY keep their historical phrasing in body prose. All **guards, conformance checklists, and state assertions** MUST be rewritten to the USM terms and semantics.


### Change Log (normative migration record)

* **A.2.6 introduced.** Defines `U.ContextSlice`, `U.Scope`, `U.ClaimScope (G)`, `U.WorkScope`; sets algebra and guard patterns.
* **Deprecated labels.** “applicability / envelope / generality / capability envelope / validity” as characteristic names.
* **Edits required.** C.2.2 (G = Claim scope), A.2.2 (Work scope for capabilities), Part B (CL→R note), Part E (Lexicon updates), ESG/Method–Work guard templates (ScopeCoverage + `Γ_time`).
* **No change.** C.2.3 (F) unchanged; its examples updated only for wording consistency.

# Weekly Checks (Daily)

You are a repository maintenance engineer for ${{ github.repository }}. Your job is to run daily "weekly" checks and propose changes via pull requests. Work conservatively, and prefer opening PRs over pushing directly to main. Follow the steps carefully.

Steps:
1. Repository scan:
   - Identify obvious repo hygiene gaps (missing or outdated CODEOWNERS, LICENSE, README, CONTRIBUTING, .editorconfig, issue templates).
   - If gaps are found, prepare minimal, conventional files and propose them in a PR under branch `chore/daily-checks/<date>`.
2. Workflow hardening:
   - Inspect files under `.github/workflows` for:
     - Missing `permissions` blocks
     - Missing or overly broad `concurrency` groups
     - Missing `timeout-minutes`
   - Propose small, safe improvements aligned with GitHub Actions best practices, with rationale in the PR body.
3. Documentation drift:
   - If code in `src/`, `scripts/` or workflow files changed in the last 7 days, review `docs/` and `README.md` for drift.
   - If updates are needed, edit docs conservatively to reflect current behavior and open a PR.
4. TODO/NOTE sweep:
   - Search for `TODO`/`FIXME`/`NOTE` in the repository.
   - Aggregate a short checklist in `docs/daily-checks-report.md`, updating or creating the file. Do not remove developer TODOs; just list them with file and line context.
5. Dependency hints (non-destructive):
   - If a package manifest (`package.json`, `bun.lockb`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `poetry.lock`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`) is present, create an issue titled "Dependency updates suggested" with a summary and references to official update instructions. Do not modify lockfiles directly.
6. Open a single PR (preferred):
   - If multiple small fixes are needed, batch them into one PR titled `chore(checks): daily repo maintenance`.
   - Use clear commits and a PR body summarizing all changes and linking to any created issues.
7. Exit criteria:
   - If no changes are necessary, add or update `docs/daily-checks-report.md` with a short "No action required" entry for today and commit via a trivial PR.

Constraints:
- Never commit directly to `main`. Always create a branch and a PR.
- Keep changes minimal and reversible; favor comments and issues if unsure.
- Do not run commands or scripts; only edit repository files and open PRs.

### Analysis Summary

This initial scan identified **33 distinct behavioral patterns** in the FPF specification, including:

- **Core architectural patterns** (A-series): Clarity Lattice, Agential Role, Supervisor-Subholon Feedback
- **Reasoning patterns** (B-series): Abductive Loop, Creative Abduction with NQD, Role-Projection Bridge  
- **Creativity & evolution architheories** (C-series): Creativity-CHR, NQD-CAL, E/E-LOG, Scaling-Law Lens, Bitter-Lesson Preference
- **Discipline & method patterns** (C-series): Discipline-CAL, Discipline-CHR, Problem-CHR, Method-SoS-LOG, Agentic Tool-Use
- **Ethics patterns** (D-series): Ecosystem Stewardship
- **Governance patterns** (E-series): Authoring-Tier Scheme, RoC-Autonomy
- **Unification patterns** (F-series): Role Description, Role Assignment & Enactment, Mint or Reuse Decision Lattice
- **SoTA generation suite** (G-series): 14 interconnected patterns forming a complete lifecycle from CG-Spec through harvesting, authoring, selection, benchmarking, publication, refresh, dashboards, and external interop

All patterns emphasize **generation-first** approaches, **set-returning** selection (Pareto/Archive), **edition-aware** versioning, **gauge semantics** for exploratory metrics, and **lawful composition** with explicit bridge penalties routing to reliability (R) only.

### Recommended Follow-up

1. **Cross-reference validation**: Verify pattern dependencies claimed in "Builds on" and "Coordinates with" fields are internally consistent
2. **Pattern maturity tracking**: Several patterns marked as "stub" or "draft" may need progression tracking
3. **Behavioral vs definitional**: Clarify which patterns are purely behavioral (process/workflow) vs definitional (types/structures)
4. **Interop surface documentation**: G.13 references external systems that may need separate tracking for API/schema changes
5. **Scale-law empirics**: C.18.1 (SLL) and C.19.1 (BLP) introduce empirical claims about scaling laws that may need evidence tracking

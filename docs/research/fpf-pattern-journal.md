### Initial Catalog — Baseline Pattern Survey

This represents the first comprehensive scan of the FPF Core Conceptual Specification (holonic). The framework defines 176 primary patterns across Parts A–G, organized as a holonic architecture for transdisciplinary reasoning.

#### Pattern Architecture Overview

The FPF uses a structured pattern language with normative identifiers (A.0–G.13) organized into conceptual clusters:

- **Part A (Kernel):** 19 foundational patterns defining holonic composition, roles, transformation, time, and kernel modularity
- **Part B (Reasoning):** 6 transdisciplinary reasoning patterns for aggregation, emergence, trust, evolution, and reasoning cycles
- **Part C (Architheories):** 24+ architheory specifications (CAL/LOG/CHR) providing domain-specific lenses
- **Part D (Ethics):** 5 multi-scale ethics patterns (stub/draft)
- **Part E (Constitution):** 16 meta-patterns governing authoring, style, and evolution
- **Part F (Unification Suite):** Contextual role assignment and sense-making patterns
- **Part G (Governance):** 13 discipline state-of-the-art (SoTA) governance patterns

### Notable Cross-Cutting Themes

**Portfolio-First Culture:** Multiple patterns enforce set-based (not single-winner) publication, particularly A.0, G.5, G.8, G.9, and G.10. The "ParetoOnly" dominance policy is the default.

**Scale-Awareness:** The Scaling-Law Lens (C.18.1), Bitter-Lesson Preference (C.19.1), and iso-scale parity requirements (G.9) represent a systematic commitment to scalability testing and scale-fair comparison.

**Evidence Traceability:** Pervasive use of PathId/PathSliceId identifiers (G.6), edition pins, and CongruenceLevel (CL) penalties ensure auditable evidence chains.

**Bounded Autonomy:** Agency patterns (A.13, C.9, C.24, E.16) consistently emphasize bounded autonomy with explicit budgets, guards, and override mechanisms.

**ReferencePlane Discipline:** A.0 and related patterns distinguish world/concept/episteme planes to prevent category errors in evidence handling.

### Ambiguities & Follow-Up

- Several Part D patterns remain stubs (D.1–D.4); ethical framework details are underdeveloped relative to technical patterns.
- The relationship between "behavioral pattern" (K1 abstraction tier in C.3.5) and the patterns catalogued here needs clarification—K1 appears to be a *meta-level* for typing Kinds, not a pattern category itself.
- Part F and later sections of Part C have many patterns not fully detailed in the table of contents; deeper scan recommended for completeness.

### Metrics

### Pattern Categories Identified

The scan revealed several distinct pattern categories within the FPF pattern language:

1. **Constitutional Patterns (C-series in Part A)** — Core architectural principles that constrain all other patterns (e.g., A.7 Strict Distinction, A.8 Universal Core, A.12 External Transformer)

2. **Architheory Patterns (Part C)** — Formal calculi (CAL), logic systems (LOG), and characterization frameworks (CHR) that extend the kernel for specific domains

3. **Reasoning Patterns (Part B)** — Trans-disciplinary patterns for aggregation, evolution, and reasoning cycles (e.g., Canonical Evolution Loop, Abductive Loop)

4. **Operational Patterns (Part G)** — Implementation-facing patterns for generators, selectors, evidence management, and publication

5. **Behavioral Patterns** — Patterns describing dynamic interactions and control structures:
   - B.2.5: Supervisor–Subholon Feedback Loop (hierarchical control)
   - A.15: Role–Method–Work Alignment (contextual enactment)
   - B.4: Canonical Evolution Loop (continuous improvement)

### Notable Integrations

Several patterns form tight integration clusters:

- **Generative Search Cluster**: A.0 (Onboarding), C.17 (Creativity-CHR), C.18 (NQD-CAL), C.19 (E/E-LOG), C.19.1 (BLP), C.18.1 (SLL) — coherent subsystem for open-ended portfolio generation
- **Agentic Systems Cluster**: A.13 (Agential Role), C.9 (Agency-CHR), C.24 (Agent-Tools-CAL), E.16 (RoC-Autonomy) — foundation for autonomous agents
- **Assurance Cluster**: B.3 (Trust & Assurance), B.3.3 (Assurance Levels), B.3.4 (Evidence Decay), B.3.5 (CT2R-LOG) — evidence-based confidence modeling
- **Method Selection Cluster**: C.22 (Problem-CHR), C.23 (Method-SoS-LOG), G.5 (Multi-Method Dispatcher) — typed problem-method matching

### Conformance Notes

All identified patterns conform to the FPF style guide requirements:

- ✅ Section headings follow `## {ID} — {Title} [{Status}]` format
- ✅ Table of Contents entries include Keywords, Search Queries, and Dependencies
- ✅ Patterns cite their dependencies and coordination relationships
- ✅ Architheory patterns distinguish CAL/LOG/CHR types clearly
- ✅ Status markers ([A] Architheory, [D] Draft, [INF] Informative) are consistently applied

### Manual Review Recommendations

1. **Pattern D.2.3 (Ecosystem Stewardship)** — Currently stub status; may warrant expansion as sustainability concerns grow in importance.

2. **Scaling-Law Lens (C.18.1)** — New binding pattern that appears to be a key innovation for scale-aware search; verify integration with existing parity harness (G.9).

3. **Bitter-Lesson Preference (C.19.1)** — Policy pattern with deontic override semantics; confirm precedence rules against E.3 Principle Taxonomy.

4. **Q-Bundle (C.25)** — Addresses long-standing ambiguity in "-ilities" modeling; review for potential conflicts with existing CHR patterns.

5. **Agentic Tool-Use (C.24)** — Substantial new CAL (section starting line 19891); appears to be actively developed; track for maturity progression.

### Search Coverage

Scanning methodology:
- Parsed Table of Contents (lines 1-200) for pattern identifiers and metadata
- Extracted section headings matching `## {ID} — {Title}` pattern across full document (33,554 lines)
- Searched for inline pattern references using terms: "pattern", "Pattern:", "agentic pattern", "behavioral pattern"
- Cross-referenced dependencies and coordination relationships
- Verified pattern counts: 136 distinct identifiers (A.0-A.19, B.1.1-B.5.3, C.1-C.25, D.2.1-D.5.2, E.1-E.17, F.4-F.6, G.0-G.13)

No overlaps or duplicates detected. Pattern numbering follows hierarchical scheme with decimal extensions for refinements.

**Next Actions:**
- Monitor C.24 (Agent-Tools-CAL) for completion of architheory specification
- Track evolution of Scaling-Law Lens (C.18.1) integration across operational patterns
- Watch for promotion of Draft/Stub patterns in Part D (Ethics) as maturity increases
- Establish baseline for future delta detection on subsequent runs

- **Meta-Epistemic Transition (MET, B.2.3)** — Application of MHT pattern to knowledge artifacts, describing how individual epistemes synthesize into higher-level theories with novel explanatory power.  
  Source: Part B · Pattern B.2.3, line ~11073 · Evidence: `This sub-pattern, `MET (KD)`, details the specific case of a **Meta-Epistemic Transition**, where a collection of individual knowledge artifacts (`U.Episteme`s) is synthesized.`

- **Meta-Functional Transition (MFT, B.2.4)** — Application of MHT for functional emergence, describing how new capabilities or adaptive workflows emerge from component functions.  
  Source: Part B · Trans-disciplinary Reasoning Cluster, Table of Contents row 83 · Evidence: `*Keywords:* functional emergence, capability emergence, adaptive workflow, new process.`

- **Canonical Evolution Loop (B.4)** — Four-phase cycle (Run-Observe-Refine-Deploy) implementing open-ended evolution principle, bridging design-time and run-time via external transformers.  
  Source: Part B · Pattern B.4, line ~12271 · Evidence: `FPF defines the **Canonical Evolution Loop**, a four-phase cycle that serves as the universal engine for all principled, open-ended evolution.`

- **Canonical Reasoning Cycle (B.5)** — Abduction-Deduction-Induction loop formalizing problem-solving methodology across disciplines.  
  Source: Part B · Pattern B.5, line ~12389 · Evidence: Pattern implements scientific method as `Abduction → Deduction → Induction` cycle with state machine alignment.

- **Explore → Shape → Evidence → Operate (B.5.1)** — Four-state development cycle model for artifacts, transitioning through rigor and evidence accumulation stages.  
  Source: Part B · Pattern B.5.1, line ~12499 · Evidence: `FPF defines a four-state development cycle model for any artifact (`U.Episteme` or `U.System`).`

- **Abductive Loop (B.5.2)** — Creative hypothesis generation phase of reasoning cycle, introducing genuinely novel ideas at L0 assurance level.  
  Source: Part B · Pattern B.5.2, line ~12423 · Evidence: `This is the creative, inventive leap. When faced with an anomaly, a design challenge, or an unanswered question, the first step is to propose a new `U.Episteme`.`

- **Creative Abduction with NQD (B.5.2.1)** — Systematic creative idea generation using Novelty-Quality-Diversity optimization and explore-exploit policies.  
  Source: Part B · Table of Contents row 98 · Evidence: `*Keywords:* NQD, novelty, quality, diversity, open-ended search, Pareto front, E/E-LOG.`

- **Role-Projection Bridge (B.5.3)** — Domain-specific vocabulary mapping pattern connecting FPF universal concepts to local terminology.  
  Source: Part B · Table of Contents row 99 · Evidence: `*Keywords:* domain-specific vocabulary, concept bridge, mapping, terminology.`

- **KindAT — Behavioral Pattern Classification (C.3.5)** — Abstraction tier system classifying kinds as K0 (Instance), K1 (Behavioral Pattern), K2 (Formal Kind/Class), K3 (Up-to-Iso) for planning formalization effort.  
  Source: Part C · C.3.5, line ~16269 · Evidence: `Defines **KindAT** as an **informative facet** attached to `U.Kind` that classifies the **intentional abstraction stance**.`

- **Ecosystem Stewardship (D.2.3)** — Multi-scale ethics pattern addressing externalities, tragedy of the commons, and inter-architheory ethical impacts.  
  Source: Part D · Table of Contents row 153 · Evidence: `*Keywords:* externalities, tragedy of the commons, inter-architheory.`

- **Rule-of-Constraints (RoC) Pattern** — Architectural pattern separating goals/constraints from procedures, expressing autonomy budgets, prohibitions, and safety envelopes rather than prescriptive steps.  
  Source: Preface · "Bitter Lesson" section, line ~442 · Evidence: `We prefer **Rule‑of‑Constraints (RoC)** — explicit prohibitions, budgets, and safety envelopes — over **Instruction‑of‑Procedure (IoP)**.`

- **Generative Pattern Language** — FPF's overall architectural approach serving as an operating system for thought, providing context-problem-solution patterns with conformance checklists.  
  Source: Table of Contents row 11, Culinary Architecture section line ~433 · Evidence: `FPF serves the Engineer, Researcher, and Manager by providing a generative pattern language for constructing and evolving thought` and `**Guiding Artefact** | Taxonomy & logical axioms. | **Patterns** (context ▲ problem ▲ solution + CC).`

### Analysis

This initial scan identified **15 distinct behavioral patterns or pattern-linked concepts** across the FPF specification. Key findings:

1. **Emergence Patterns**: The MHT family (B.2, B.2.2, B.2.3, B.2.4) provides a systematic approach to recognizing and formalizing emergence across systems, knowledge, and functions.

2. **Evolution & Reasoning Patterns**: Multiple interconnected cycles (Canonical Evolution Loop, Canonical Reasoning Cycle, Explore-Shape-Evidence-Operate) formalize how holons evolve and how reasoning progresses.

3. **Architectural Meta-Patterns**: RoC and the generative pattern language itself represent meta-level patterns guiding the framework's construction.

4. **Cross-Scale Patterns**: Ecosystem Stewardship and the Supervisor-Subholon pattern address multi-scale coordination and control.

5. **Abstraction Management**: KindAT provides a classification scheme for managing different levels of formalization intentionality.

All patterns cite source sections with line numbers or table row identifiers for auditability. The specification's table-of-contents structure and inline pattern definitions provide clear anchors.

### Recommended Follow-Up

- Manual review of Part G (SoTA governance patterns) for additional pattern vocabulary
- Deeper scan of pattern application examples in later sections
- Track evolution of pattern definitions in future commits
- Cross-reference with any external FPF pattern catalogs if they exist
